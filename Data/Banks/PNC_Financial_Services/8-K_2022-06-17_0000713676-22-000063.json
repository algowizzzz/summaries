(\u201cPNC\u201d) approved grants\nof performance-based restricted stock units\n(\u201cPRSUs\u201d) with a five-year performance period\nto three executives (each grant, a \u201cLeadership\nContinuity Award\u201d) based on the following\ndollar values (at target). The number of PRSUs\ngranted to each of the following executives\nwas determined by dividing the dollar value of\nthe applicable Leadership Continuity Award by\nthe closing price of a share of PNC Common\nStock on the Effective Date ($155.53 per\nshare):\n                                              \n                         Dollar               \n                         Value        Number  \n  Execut\u2026    Title       of         of PRSUs  \n  Officer                Grant           (At  \n                         (At         Target)  \n                         Target)              \n             Executi\u2026                         \n             Vice                             \n             Preside\u2026                         \n  Michael    and Head    $10.8                \n  P.         of          million      69,440  \n  Lyons      Corpora\u2026                         \n             &                                \n             Institu\u2026                         \n             Banking                          \n             Executi\u2026                         \n  E          Vice                             \n  William    Preside\u2026    $10.2                \n  Parsle\u2026    and         million      65,583  \n  III        Chief                            \n             Operati\u2026                         \n             Officer                          \n             Executi\u2026                         \n             Vice                             \n  Robert     Preside\u2026    $5.5                 \n  Q.         and         million      35,363  \n  Reilly     Chief                            \n             Financi\u2026                         \n             Officer                          \n                                              \nIn granting the Leadership Continuity Awards,\nthe Committee intends to address three key\nobjectives: (1) ensuring leadership continuity\nto support the CEO in executing the\norganization\u2019s strategic priorities over the\nnext several years; (2) increasing PNC\u2019s\nability to retain senior leadership in a\nhighly competitive environment; and (3)\nstrengthening the alignment between\ncompensation and long-term shareholder value\ncreation.\n\nThe Leadership Continuity Award is a stock-\nbased award subject to the vesting conditions\ndescribed below. The Leadership Continuity\nAward is separate from the annual or long-term\nincentive compensation awards that may be\ngranted by the Committee to each executive\nfollowing the completion of the 2022\nperformance year. The terms and conditions of\nthe Leadership Continuity Award were developed\nwith input from the Committee\u2019s independent\ncompensation consultant.\n\nThe Committee established a performance-based\nmetric for the Leadership Continuity Award\ntied to PNC\u2019s total shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d)\nas compared to a peer group. The overall\npayout percentage of the Leadership Continuity\nAward, and the amount realized by each\nexecutive, will be based on PNC\u2019s performance\nagainst such relative TSR goal and may be\nadjusted downward at the discretion of the\nCommittee based on the executive\u2019s individual\nperformance. The maximum payout percentage may\nnot exceed 125% of the target award and will\nrequire relative TSR outperformance by PNC, as\ndescribed in the chart below. In the event\nPNC\u2019s absolute TSR is negative at the end of\nthe performance period, the maximum payout\npercentage may not exceed 100%.\n\nVesting will be determined over a five-year\nperformance period beginning on the Effective\nDate, with the following adjustments for\nrelative TSR performance :\n                                              \n  Percentile                                  \n  Performance of PNC    Percent Increase or   \n  TSR Relative to       Reduction in Payout   \n  Peer Group                                  \n  \u226425th percentile      25% reduction         \n  50th percentile       Target (no            \n                        reduction)            \n  \u226575th percentile      25% increase          \n                                              \nPNC\u2019s closing stock price on the Effective\nDate will be used to calculate achievement of\nthe relative TSR goal. The initial peer group\nfor the relative TSR metric is the same as the\npeer group described in PNC\u2019s 2022 definitive\nproxy statement on Schedule 14A, which was\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) on March 16, 2022 (the\n\u201c2022 Proxy\u201d).\nThe Leadership Continuity Award is also\nsubject to the same risk-related performance\nmetric and review to which the executives are\nsubject under their 2021 Performance Share\nUnit (\u201cPSU\u201d) awards, as described in the 2022\nProxy. A form of award agreement for the 2021\nPSU awards is attached as Exhibit 10.26 to\nPNC\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which was\nfiled with the SEC on February 5, 2022 (the\n\u201c2021 Form 10-K\u201d).\n\nVesting is subject to continuous service with\nPNC until the end of the five-year performance\nperiod (i.e., June 13, 2027), with limited\nexceptions as set forth in the applicable\naward agreement and PNC\u2019s 2016 Incentive Award\nPlan (the \u201cIAP\u201d), including upon death and\ndisability. In addition, in the event (1) PNC\nterminates the executive\u2019s employment without\nCause during the performance period (as\ndefined in the IAP), or (2) the executive\nterminates his employment with PNC by reason\nof a qualifying retirement at any time\nfollowing the third anniversary of the\nEffective Date, the Committee has the\ndiscretion to continue vesting all or a\nportion of the\n\nLeadership Continuity Award. In both cases,\nthe payment timing and final payout\npercentages remain the same as though the\nexecutive had remained employed during the\nentire performance period.\n\nAmounts earned under the Leadership Continuity\nAward will be settled in shares of PNC Common\nStock to be delivered following the end of the\nperformance period, along with dividend\nequivalent rights that have accrued throughout\nthe performance period. These shares will be\nsubject to the forfeiture and clawback\nprovisions applicable to equity-based awards\nas set forth in PNC\u2019s Incentive Compensation\nAdjustment and Clawback Policy.\n\nThis summary of the Leadership Continuity\nAward is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the applicable award agreement,\nwhich PNC will file as an exhibit to its\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal\nquarter ending June 30, 2022, and to the IAP,\nwhich is included as Exhibit 10.7 to the 2021\nForm 10-K.\n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n                       THE PNC                \n                       FINANCIAL              \n                       SERVICES               \n                       GROUP,       /s/       \n                       INC.
