Also, see\nthe Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Information section in this Financial\nReview and the Critical Accounting Estimates\nAnd Judgments section in this Financial Review\nand in our 2020 Form 10-K for certain other\nfactors that could cause actual results or\nfuture events to differ, perhaps materially,\nfrom historical performance and from those\nanticipated in the forward-looking statements\nincluded in this Report.

section provide information\nregarding items impacting the comparability of\nthe periods presented.\n\n(b) Dividends are payable quarterly other than\nSeries O, Series R and Series S preferred\nstock, which are payable semiannually, with\nthe Series O payable in different quarters\nthan the Series R and Series S preferred\nstock.\n\n(c) The effective income tax rates are\ngenerally lower than the statutory rate due to\nthe relationship of pretax income to tax\ncredits and earnings that are not subject to\ntax.\n\n(d) Net interest margin is the total yield on\ninterest-earning assets minus the total rate\non interest-bearing liabilities and includes\nthe benefit from use of noninterest-bearing\nsources. To provide more meaningful\ncomparisons of net interest margins, we use\nnet interest income on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis in calculating average yields used in\nthe calculation of net interest margin by\nincreasing the interest income earned on tax-\nexempt assets to make it fully equivalent to\ninterest income earned on taxable investments.\nThis adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in\nthe Consolidated Income Statement.

These statements are based on\nour views, as follows:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2022 Despite the improvement in the economy since\nthe spring of 2020, economic activity remains\nbelow its pre-pandemic level and unemployment\nremains elevated.\n\n\u2022 Growth will pick up in the spring of 2021 as\nvaccine distribution continues and the federal\ngovernment provides aid to households, small\nand medium-sized businesses, and state and\nlocal governments. PNC expects real GDP to\nreturn to its pre-pandemic level in the third\nquarter of 2021, and employment in the second\nhalf of 2022.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25%\nuntil at least late 2023.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2021 compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2021 where appropriate, we\nexpect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up approximately\n2%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be up approximately 3% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income to be between $300\nmillion and $350 million,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be stable, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $150\nmillion and $200 million.\n\nFor the PNC standalone full year 2021,\nexcluding one-time costs related to the BBVA\ntransaction, compared to full year 2020 where\nappropriate, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be down approximately 3% to\n4%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be stable, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be 17%.\n\nAssuming a mid-2021 close date and excluding\none-time integration costs, we expect the\npending BBVA acquisition to be approximately\n$700 million accretive to PNC\u2019s 2021 pre-tax\npreprovision net revenue.\n\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nFinancial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in\nour 2020 Form 10-K for other factors that\ncould cause future events to differ, perhaps\nmaterially, from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements.\n                                              \n   C                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ONSOLIDATED                                \n                                              \n                                              \n   I                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   NCOME                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   S                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   TATEMENT                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n   R                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   EVIEW                                      \n                                              \nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\n\nNet income from continuing operations of $1.8\nbillion, or $4.10 per diluted common share for\nthe first quarter of 2021 increased $1.1\nbillion compared to net income from continuing\noperations of $0.8 billion, or $1.59 per\ndiluted common share, for the first quarter of\n2020.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income decreased $163 million, or\n6%, for the first quarter of 2021 compared to\nthe same period in 2020. The decrease was due\nto lower yields on earning assets partially\noffset by lower rates on deposits, higher\naverage earning assets and a decline in\nborrowing costs and balances. Net interest\nmargin decreased 57 basis points reflecting\nhigher balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank and lower yields on securities and loans,\npartially offset by lower rates on deposits,\nlower borrowing costs and balances.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $2.0\nbillion, or 2%. The increase was primarily due\nto an increase in U.S. treasury and government\nsecurities partially offset by lower\nresidential mortgage-backed securities.\nAverage investment securities represented 21%\nof average interest-earning assets for the\nfirst quarter of 2021 compared to 24% for the\nsame period in 2020.\n\nAverage loans decreased $5.4 billion, or 2%,\nprimarily due to lower consumer loans,\npartially offset by higher commercial loans as\na result of PPP loan originations.

well\npositioned at March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased as a result of higher\ninvestment securities, partially offset by a\ndecrease in loans.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased primarily due to\ndeposit growth reflecting customer liquidity\naccumulation, partially offset by lower\nborrowed funds.\n\n\u2022 Total equity decreased primarily due to\nlower AOCI and dividends on common and\npreferred stock, partially offset by higher\nnet income.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.2 billion\nat March 31, 2021, a decrease of $0.7 billion\nsince December 31, 2020. The decrease was\nattributable to lower expected losses within\nthe loan portfolio, resulting in a $0.6\nbillion provision recapture for credit losses\nand net charge-offs of $0.1 billion. The\nprovision recapture primarily reflected\nimprovements in macroeconomic factors and\nlower loans outstanding.

The\nincrease was attributable to a provision\nrecapture and lower noninterest expense,\npartially offset by a decline in total\nrevenue.\n\nNet interest income decreased primarily due to\nnarrower interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits and loans, as well as declines in\naverage loan balances, partially offset by\ngrowth in average deposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income decreased largely due to\ndeclines in residential mortgage revenue,\ndriven by lower revenue from residential\nmortgage servicing rights valuation, net of\neconomic hedge and lower service charges on\ndeposits driven primarily by lower overdraft\ninstances as a result of higher average\ndeposit account balances due to government\nstimulus. The decrease in noninterest income\nwas partially offset by the favorable impact\nof derivative fair value adjustments related\nto Visa Class B common shares in the first\nquarter of 2021.\n\nProvision recapture in the first three months\nof 2021 was driven by improvements in\nmacroeconomic factors and lower loans\noutstanding.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased primarily as a\nresult of lower customer related transaction\ncosts, personnel, and marketing expenses,\npartially offset by increased technology\ninvestments.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 15\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the\nfirst three months of 2021, average total\ndeposits increased compared to the same period\nin 2020 primarily driven by growth in demand\nand savings deposits which benefited from the\nimpact of government stimulus payments and\nlower consumer spending due to the pandemic.\nSavings and demand deposits also increased\ndue, in part, to a shift from money market\ndeposits to relationship-based savings\nproducts.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans decreased\nin the first three months of 2021 compared\nwith the same period in 2020:\n\n\u2022 Average auto loan balances declined due to\nimpacts of the pandemic on the auto industry\nand proactive credit tightening.\n\n\u2022 Average credit card balances decreased due\nto credit tightening actions taken as a result\nof the pandemic combined with changes in\ncustomer behavior resulting in lower consumer\nspending and higher balance paydowns driven by\ngovernment stimulus.\n\n\u2022 Average home equity loans decreased as\npaydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated\nvolume.\n\n\u2022 Average other consumer loans declined driven\nby lower originations due to the pandemic and\nthe effects of government stimulus and credit\ntightening.\n\n\u2022 Average residential real estate loans\ndecreased due to paydowns outpacing\noriginations.\n\n\u2022 Average education loans decreased driven by\na decline in the runoff portfolio of\ngovernment guaranteed education loans.\n\n\u2022 Average commercial loans increased primarily\ndue to PPP loans.\n\nOur national expansion strategy is designed to\ngrow customers with digitally-led banking and\na thin branch network in markets outside of\nour existing retail branch network and began\noffering our digital high yield savings\ndeposit product and opened our first solution\ncenter in Kansas City. Solution centers are an\nemerging branch operating model with a\ndistinctive layout, where routine transactions\nare supported through a combination of\ntechnology and skilled banker assistance to\ncreate personalized experiences. The primary\nfocus of the solution center is to bring a\ncommunity element to our digital banking\ncapabilities. The solution center provides a\ncollaborative environment that connects our\ncustomers with our digital solutions and\nservices, beyond deposits and withdrawals. In\n2020, we expanded into three new markets,\nBoston, Houston and Nashville and opened\nseventeen new solution centers. In the first\nquarter of 2021 we opened three new solution\ncenters, bringing the total open solution\ncenters to 25 within our existing markets of\nBoston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Kansas\nCity and Nashville. We also offer digital\nunsecured installment and small business loans\nin the expansion markets. Beginning in\nmid-2021, we expect the BBVA acquisition will\naccelerate our Retail National expansion\nefforts to become a coast-to-coast Retail\nBank.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of our\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking and investment products. In\nApril 2021, we announced our Low Cash Mode SM\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae feature which will give all\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae customers the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent\nor address overdrafts, and controls to choose\nwhether to return certain debits rather than\nthe bank making the decision. During our pre-\nlaunch pilot to nearly 20,000 Virtual Wallet \u00ae\ncustomers, overdraft fees were collectively\nreduced by more than 60 percent. As a result\nof these changes, we expect to help Virtual\nWallet \u00ae customers avoid $125 to $150 million\nin overdraft fees annually. Our full year 2021\nrevenue outlook anticipated this fee\nreduction, and as a result is not impacted by\nthis change. See the Executive Summary section\nin this Financial Review for additional\ninformation on our business outlook.\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result have closed 29 branches in the\nfirst three months of 2021 consistent with our\nplan.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 79% of consumer customers used\nnon-teller channels for the majority of their\ntransactions in the first three months of 2021\ncompared with 71% in 2020, in part reflecting\nconsumer transaction behavior changes during\nthe pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile\nchannels increased to 66% of total deposit\ntransactions in the first three months of 2021\nfrom 59% in 2020, in part reflecting consumer\ntransaction behavior changes during the\npandemic.\n\nRetail Banking completed its multi-year\ninitiative to redesign the home lending\nprocess, including integrating mortgage and\nhome equity lending into a common platform.\nTechnology enhancements have supported\nincreased residential mortgage origination\nvolume. In addition, we enhanced the home\nequity origination process to make it easier\nand to reach additional customers by offering\nthe product in new states. The enhanced\nproduct is currently available in 43 states\nand we are moving toward offering the product\nin most of the remaining states in 2021.\nAdditional improvements for both mortgage and\nhome equity are planned to continue throughout\n2021.\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nin response to evolving market conditions,\nbank funding needs and client relationship\ndynamics.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking continues to\nexpand its Corporate Banking business, focused\non the middle market and larger sectors. We\nexecuted on our expansion plans into the\nSeattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in\n2021, we expect the BBVA acquisition to\naccelerate our expansion efforts across the\nSouthwest, but this has not changed our\nstrategy regarding our de novo expansion\nefforts. This follows offices opened in Boston\nand Phoenix in 2019, Denver, Houston and\nNashville in 2018, and Dallas, Kansas City and\nMinneapolis in 2017. These locations\ncomplement Corporate & Institutional Banking\nnational businesses with a significant\npresence in these cities and build on past\nsuccesses in the markets where PNC\u2019s retail\nbanking presence was limited, such as in the\nSoutheast. Our full suite of commercial\nproducts and services is offered in these\nlocations.\n                                              \n  P                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  roduct Revenue                              \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital\nmarkets-related products and services and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, for\ncustomers of all business segments. On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome, corporate service fees and other\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses.

A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\npayables, receivables, deposit and account\nservices, liquidity and investments, and\nonline and mobile banking products and\nservices to our clients. Treasury management\nrevenue is reported in noninterest income and\nnet interest income. Noninterest income\nincludes treasury management product revenue\nless earnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services. Net interest income\nprimarily includes revenue from all treasury\nmanagement customer deposit balances. Compared\nwith the first three months of 2020, treasury\nmanagement revenue was relatively unchanged as\nhigher deposit balances and higher noninterest\nincome was mostly offset by narrower interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits.\n\nCapital markets-related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The increase in capital\nmarkets-related revenue in the comparison was\nprimarily driven by higher fixed income\ntrading, equity capital market advisory fees\nand underwriting fees, partially offset by\nlower customer-related derivative fees.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income) and revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nrelated hedges. Total revenue from commercial\nmortgage banking activities increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to higher commercial\nmortgage servicing income.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 19\n                                              \n  Asset Management Group                      \n                                              \nAsset Management Group is focused on being a\npremier bank-held individual and institutional\nasset manager in each of the markets it\nserves.

We continue\nto carefully monitor and manage these loans,\nand while we have not yet experienced material\ncharge-offs in these industries, we do expect\nto see continued stress.\n\nIn our non-real estate related category we\nhave $9.9 billion in loans outstanding, $2.6\nbillion of which are funded through the PPP\nand guaranteed by the SBA. Nonperforming loans\nin these industries totaled $0.1 billion, or\n1% of total loans outstanding in the non-real\nestate related category, while criticized\nassets totaled $1.3 billion at March 31, 2021\nwith the greatest stress seen in the leisure\nrecreation and leisure travel sectors.\n\nWithin the real estate related category we\nhave $7.2 billion in loans outstanding, which\nincludes real estate projects of $4.8 billion\nand unsecured real estate of $2.4 billion.\nNonperforming loans in these industries\ntotaled $0.1 billion at March 31, 2021, or 1%\nof total loans outstanding in the commercial\nreal estate related category, driven primarily\nby one real estate investment trust. In this\ncategory, we continue to see substantial\nstress in the non-essential retail and hotel\nsegments.\n\nOil and Gas Loan Portfolio\n\nWe are also monitoring our oil and gas\nportfolio closely for elevated levels of\ncredit risk given the continued pressures on\nthe energy industry. As of March 31, 2021, our\noutstanding loans in the oil and gas sector\ntotaled $3.0 billion, or 1.0% of total\nloans.This portfolio comprised approximately\n$1.3 billion in the midstream and downstream\nsectors, $0.9 billion of oil services\ncompanies and $0.8 billion related to\nexploration and production companies. Of the\noil services category, approximately $0.2\nbillion is not asset-based or investment\ngrade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas\nsector as of March 31, 2021 totaled $0.1\nbillion, or 3% of total loans outstanding in\nthis sector. Additional unfunded loan\ncommitments for the oil and gas portfolio\ntotaled $7.2 billion at March 31, 2021.\n\nConsumer\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $12.6 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $10.9 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at March 31, 2021.\nComparable amounts were $12.6 billion and\n$11.5 billion, as of December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance monthly,\nincluding obtaining original LTVs and updated\nFICO scores, LTVs and other credit metrics at\nleast quarterly, including the historical\nperformance of any related mortgage loans\nregardless of whether we hold the lien. We\nalso segment the population into pools based\non product type ( e.g. , home equity loans,\nbrokered home equity loans, home equity lines\nof credit, brokered home equity lines of\ncredit). This information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nNewly originated loans over the last twelve\nmonths had a weighted-average LTV on\noriginations of 66% and a weighted-average\nFICO score of 779.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse an industry-leading third-party service\nprovider to obtain updated loan information,\nincluding lien and collateral data that is\naggregated from public and private sources.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents our home equity\nloans by geography and lien type:\n\nTable 17: Home Equity Loans by Geography and\nby Lien Type\n                                              \n           Ma\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  G\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  5,\u2026     23  %    $  5,\u2026     23  %  \n  N\u2026       3,\u2026     14          3,\u2026     14     \n  J\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       2,\u2026     11          2,\u2026     11     \n  F\u2026       1,\u2026      6          1,\u2026      6     \n  M\u2026       1,\u2026      6          1,\u2026      6     \n  I\u2026       1,\u2026      6          1,\u2026      6     \n  M\u2026       1,\u2026      6          1,\u2026      6     \n  N\u2026       1,\u2026      4          1,\u2026      4     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  K\u2026       875      4          922      4     \n  I\u2026       779      3          813      3     \n  O\u2026       3,\u2026     17          3,\u2026     17     \n  T\u2026                                          \n  h\u2026    $  23\u2026    100  %    $  24\u2026    100  %  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  t\u2026                                          \n  1\u2026               64  %               63  %  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026               36                  37     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026              100  %              100  %  \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at March 31, 2021.\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nWe track borrower performance of this\nportfolio monthly similarly to home equity\nloans.

Refer to\nthe Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications discussion in this Credit Risk\nManagement section for more information on the\ntreatment of loan modifications under the\nCARES Act.\n\nAt March 31, 2021, our largest nonperforming\nasset was $141 million in the Real Estate and\nRental and Leasing industry and the ten\nlargest individual nonperforming assets\nrepresented 17% of total nonperforming assets.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 27\nLoan Delinquencies\n\nWe regularly monitor the level of loan\ndelinquencies and believe these levels may be\na key indicator of credit quality in our loan\nportfolio. Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in\nApril 2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 delinquency\nstatus of loans modified due to COVID-19\nrelated hardships aligns with the rules set\nforth for banks to report delinquency status\nto the credit agencies. These rules require\nthat COVID-19 related loan modifications be\nreported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the contractual\nterms of the loan, even where borrowers may\nnot be making payments on their loans during\nthe modification period. Loan modifications\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate or the principal balance of a\nloan do not qualify for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act or the interagency guidance. See the\nCOVID-19 Relief section in Item 1 of our 2020\nForm 10-K for more information on the CARES\nAct and the related interagency guidance.\n                                              \n  Table 22: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)       \n                                              \n                                              \n                                  %           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed loans of $0.6 billion at\nboth March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\ncontinue to accrue interest because they are\n(i) well secured by collateral and are in the\nprocess of collection, (ii) managed in\nhomogeneous portfolios with specified charge-\noff timeframes adhering to regulatory\nguidelines, or (iii) certain government\ninsured or guaranteed loans.

TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that have been\nrestructured but that meet certain criteria\nunder the CARES Act are not categorized as\nTDRs.

\n                                              \nLiquidity risk, including our liquidity\nmonitoring measures and tools, is described in\nfurther detail in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement section of our 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nOne of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR\nis calculated by dividing the amount of an\ninstitution\u2019s HQLA, as defined and calculated\nin accordance with the LCR rules, by its\nestimated, weighted net cash outflows, with\nnet cash outflows determined by applying the\nassumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The\nresulting quotient is expressed as a\npercentage. Effective January 1, 2020, PNC and\nPNC Bank, as Category III institutions under\nthe Tailoring Rules, were subject to a reduced\nLCR requirement, with each company's net\noutflows reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the\namount of HQLA each institution must hold to\nmeet the LCR minimum requirement. The minimum\nLCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to\nmaintain continues to be 100%. PNC and PNC\nBank calculate the LCR daily, and as of March\n31, 2021, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the requirement of 100%.\n\n32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits increased to\n$375.1 billion at March 31, 2021 from $365.3\nbillion at December 31, 2020, driven by growth\nin both noninterest-bearing and interest-\nbearing deposits. See the Funding Sources\nportion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nReview section of this Financial Review for\nadditional information related to our\ndeposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt March 31, 2021, our liquid assets consisted\nof cash and due from banks and short-term\ninvestments (federal funds sold, resale\nagreements, trading securities and interest-\nearning deposits with banks) totaling $96.0\nbillion and securities available for sale\ntotaling $96.8 billion. The level of liquid\nassets fluctuates over time based on many\nfactors, including market conditions, loan and\ndeposit growth and balance sheet management\nactivities. Our liquid assets included $21.7\nbillion of securities available for sale and\ntrading securities pledged as collateral to\nsecure public and trust deposits, repurchase\nagreements and for other purposes. In\naddition, $0.1 billion of securities held to\nmaturity were also pledged as collateral for\nthese purposes.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings).

At March 31, 2021, PNC Bank had $17.6\nbillion of notes outstanding under this\nprogram of which $12.6 billion were senior\nbank notes and $5.0 billion were subordinated\nbank notes.\n\nOn March 30, 2021, PNC Bank redeemed $1.25\nbillion of outstanding Senior Notes with an\noriginal scheduled maturity date of April 29,\n2021. The securities had a distribution rate\nof 2.150%. The redemption price was equal to\n$1,000 per $1,000 in principal amount, plus\nany accrued and unpaid distributions to the\nredemption date of March 30, 2021.\n\nPNC Bank maintains additional secured\nborrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh\nand through the Federal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nMarch 31, 2021, our unused secured borrowing\ncapacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the\nFederal Reserve Bank totaled $81.8 billion. In\nMarch 2021, the Federal Reserve extended its\nPPP Liquidity Facility to June 30, 2021. For\nadditional information on this special\nliquidity facility see the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section of this Report.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of March 31, 2021,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing senior\nunsecured notes.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 33\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains adequate liquidity to\nfund discretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $14.2 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is primarily held in\nintercompany cash. Investments with longer\ndurations may also be acquired, and if so, the\nrelated maturities are aligned with scheduled\ncash needs, such as the maturity of parent\ncompany debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends it receives from\nPNC Bank, which may be impacted by the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws and regulations,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was approximately $2.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in our 2020 Form 10-K for a further\ndiscussion of these limitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. The parent company has the\nability to offer up to $5.0 billion of\ncommercial paper to provide additional\nliquidity. As of March 31, 2021, there were no\ncommercial paper issuances outstanding.\n\nThe parent company has an effective shelf\nregistration statement pursuant to which we\ncan issue additional debt, equity and other\ncapital instruments. See Note 16 Subsequent\nEvents for information on the April 2021\nissuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes by\nthe parent company.\n\nParent company senior and subordinated debt\noutstanding totaled $10.2 billion and $10.6\nbillion at March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively.\n\nPNC will use approximately $11.6 billion of\nparent company cash to acquire BBVA.\n                                              \n  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     \n                                              \nWe have contractual obligations representing\nrequired future payments on borrowed funds,\ntime deposits, leases, pension and\npostretirement benefits and purchase\nobligations.

On\nApril 1, 2021, the PNC board of directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.15 per share payable on May 5,\n2021.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we refrained from\nrepurchasing shares and expect to continue to\ndo so for the remainder of the period leading\nup to the close of our pending BBVA\ntransaction. Following the close, we expect to\nresume repurchases in the second half of 2021.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has also imposed special\nlimitations on dividends and share repurchases\nby CCAR-participating BHCs. These restrictions\nlimit increases in dividends and generally\nrestrict dividends and share repurchases to an\namount based on income over the past year. For\na firm with capital levels above those\nrequired by the current round of stress tests,\nthese restrictions will end on June 30, 2021.\nFirms that fall below any of their minimum\nrisk-based

The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account both on balance sheets assets as\nwell as certain off-balance sheet items,\nincluding loan commitments and potential\nfuture exposure under derivative contracts.\n\n(e) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(f) The Basel III Total risk-based capital\nratios include nonqualifying trust preferred\ncapital securities of $20 million that are\nsubject to a phase-out period that runs\nthrough 2021.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date compared to the CECL ACL at\ntransition. The estimated CECL impact is added\nto CET1 capital through December 31, 2021,\nthen phased-out over the following three\nyears. PNC elected to adopt this optional\ntransition provision effective as of March 31,\n2020. See additional discussion of this rule\nin the Supervision and Regulation section of\nItem 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nIn response to the economic conditions caused\nby the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has\nadopted a final rule that revises, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of\nsupplementary leverage exposure (the\ndenominator of the SLR) by BHCs to exclude the\non-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks. The rule was effective as of April 14,\n2020 and remained in effect through March 31,\n2021. The OCC also has permitted national\nbanks to exclude such on-balance sheet amounts\n\n36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nfrom the bank\u2019s supplementary leverage\nexposure, provided the bank agrees to obtain\nOCC approval of capital distributions during\nthe effective period of the exclusion. PNC\nBank has not elected to take advantage of this\nOCC rule.\n\nAt March 31, 2021, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole\nbank subsidiary, were both considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d based on applicable U.S.\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. To\nqualify as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, PNC must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6% for\nTier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for\nCommon equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8%\nfor Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at\nleast 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our March 31,\n2021 capital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management                      \n                                              \nSee the Market Risk Management portion of the\nRisk Management Section in our 2020 Form 10-K\nfor additional discussion regarding market\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans.

PNC holds instruments and\nservices its instruments and instruments owned\nby others that may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC, like other\nfinancial participants, to financial, legal,\noperational, and reputational risks.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, PNC has established a cross-\nfunctional governance structure to oversee the\noverall strategy for the transition from LIBOR\nand mitigate risks associated with the\ntransition. An initial LIBOR impact and risk\nassessment has been performed, which\nidentified the associated risks across\nproducts, systems, models, and processes. PNC\nalso established an enterprise-level program,\nwhich is actively monitoring PNC\u2019s overall\nfirm-wide exposure to LIBOR and using these\nresults to plan transitional strategies and\ntrack progress versus these goals. Program\nworkstreams were formed by Line of Business to\nensure accountability and alignment with the\nappropriate operational, technology, and\ncustomer-facing stakeholders, while\nestablishing a centralized Program Management\nOffice to ensure consistency in execution and\ncommunication. Project plans and established\nmilestones have been developed and have\ncontinued to evolve and be refined in line\nwith industry developments and internal\ndecisions and progress. PNC is also involved\nin industry discussions, preparing milestones\nfor readiness and assessing progress against\nthose milestones, along with developing and\ndelivering on internal and external LIBOR\ncessation communication plans.\n\nKey efforts in 2020 included:\n\n\u2022 Enhancing fallback language in new contracts\nand reviewing existing legal\ncontracts/agreements to assess fallback\nlanguage impacts,\n\n\u2022 Making preparations for internal operational\nreadiness,\n\n\u2022 Making necessary enhancements to PNC's\ninfrastructure, including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes,\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Developing and delivering on internal and\nexternal LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n\n\u2022 Engaging with PNC clients, industry working\ngroups and regulators, and\n\n\u2022 Monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments.\n\nPNC also has been an active participant in\nefforts with the Federal Reserve and other\nregulatory agencies to explore the potential\nneed for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to\nSOFR for use in commercial loans. Those\nefforts led to the formation of the Credit\nSensitive Group, which has held a series of\nworkshops to assess how a credit-sensitive\nrate or add-on to SOFR might be constructed\nand discuss associated implementation issues.\n\nIn addition, in the third quarter of 2020, PNC\nbegan offering conforming adjustable rate\nmortgages using SOFR instead of USD LIBOR in\nline with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nrequirements. Plans are in place to begin\noffering private student loans and portfolio\nloans using non-LIBOR rates in the second\nquarter of 2021. PNC has provided regular\nupdates to Federal Reserve, OCC and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation examination\nstaff regarding its LIBOR cessation and\ntransition plans.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities.

Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the March 31, 2021 per\nshare closing price of $211.73 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.2 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was not\nsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2020 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements.

In March\n2021, President Biden signed the American\nRescue Plan (The American Rescue Plan Act of\n2021), which provides an additional $1.9\ntrillion in relief. Among other things, the\nAmerican Rescue Plan provides for stimulus\npayments of up to $1,400 per-person, funding\nfor various housing and education programs,\ngrants to small businesses, extension of\nexpanded unemployment benefits, and expansion\nof the child tax credit. The President also\nsigned the PPP Extension Act of 2021, which\nextends the PPP application deadline to May\n31, 2021, and extends the PPP authorization\nthrough June 30, 2021, to provide the SBA\nadditional time to process applications\nreceived by the application deadline. PNC\ncontinues to participate in the PPP and assist\ncustomers with their PPP loans.\n\nIn March 2021, the Federal Reserve extended\nits PPP Liquidity Facility by three months to\nJune 30, 2021.

Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and fair value measurements\nare described in Critical Accounting Estimates\nand Judgments in Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.\nThe following details the critical estimates\nand judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases (including residual\nvalues), other financial assets and unfunded\nlending related commitments, for the remaining\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected\nprepayments. Our determination of the ACL is\nbased on historical loss experience, current\nborrower characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We use methods sensitive to\nchanges in economic conditions, to interpret\nthese factors to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate ACL on an\nongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to\nreflect in the ACL our best estimate of\namounts that we do not expect to collect\nbecause of, among other things, idiosyncratic\nrisk factors, changes in economic conditions\nthat may not be reflected in forecasted\nresults, or other potential methodology\nlimitations. The ACL estimates are therefore\nsusceptible to various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, the following major factors:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions and borrower\nquality: Our forecast of expected losses\ndepends on economic conditions and\n\nportfolio quality as of the estimation date.\nAs current economic conditions evolve,\nforecasted losses could be materially\n\naffected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Change to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 41\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios' weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe s cenarios used for the period ended March\n31, 2021 were designed to reflect an improved\nnear-term economic outlook in comparison to\nthe scenarios used for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020. This improvement was the\nresult of declining COVID-19 cases, more rapid\nvaccine distribution, the passage of the\nAmerican Rescue Plan stimulus package and\neconomic momentum fueled by increased consumer\nspending. We used a number of economic\nvariables in our scenarios, with the most\nsignificant drivers being GDP and unemployment\nrate measures. Using the weighted-average of\nour four economic forecast scenarios, we\nestimated that GDP grows 4.3% in 2021,\nrecovering to pre-recession peak levels in the\nthird quarter of 2021. The weighted-average\nunemployment rate reflects continued recovery\nin the labor market in 2021, with the\nunemployment rate estimated at 5.9% by the end\nof the year. Employment gains were estimated\nto continue through the forecast period with\nthe unemployment rate reaching 4.9% and 4.4%\nby the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively. One\nof the scenarios included in our weighted-\naverage is our baseline prediction of the most\nlikely economic outcome; which includes\nestimated GDP recovering to pre-pandemic\nlevels in third quarter of 2021, with\nunemployment expected to return to its pre-\npandemic levels in the second half of 2022.\nSee our Business Outlook and the Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation in this Financial Review for\nadditional discussion on our baseline\nprediction of the most likely economic\noutcome. While the economy saw significant\nrecovery from the onset of the pandemic in\nnational level macroeconomic indicators,\nconsiderable uncertainty remains regarding\noverall lifetime loss content for both our\ncommercial and consumer portfolios,\nspecifically as it relates to our customers\nthat are less likely to benefit from the\neconomic recovery currently underway. For\ncommercial borrowers, there are concerns\naround industries that are dependent on in-\nperson gatherings, hospitality and tourism.\nFor consumer borrowers, payment behavior once\nthe government stimulus wanes is also\ndifficult to predict. We believe the highest\nuncertainty is concentrated with consumer\nborrowers who have been afforded payment\ndeferrals or forbearance and borrowers at the\nlow end of our credit standards. As such, for\nboth our commercial and consumer loan\nportfolios, PNC identified and performed\nsignificant analysis around these key, highly\nimpacted segments to ensure our reserves were\nadequate in light of the improved economic\nenvironment. We believe that the economic\nassumptions used in the scenarios for the\nfirst quarter of 2021, in combination with\nincreased reserves for borrowers in segments\nmost adversely impacted by the pandemic,\nsufficiently reflect the life of loan losses\nin the current portfolio.\n\nTo provide additional context regarding the\nsensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic\nforecast of expected economic outcomes, we\nconsidered what our ACL would be when applying\na 100% probability weighting to the most\nseverely adverse scenario. This severely\nadverse scenario estimates real GDP\ncontracting and ending 2021 down 1.3% compared\nto 2020 levels, with recovery to pre-pandemic\nlevels not expected until first quarter 2023,\nwhile the unemployment rate increases to end\n2021 at 10.5% with the labor market beginning\nto improve again in 2022. Excluding\nconsideration of qualitative adjustments, this\nsensitivity analysis would result in a\nhypothetical increase in our ACL of $2.0\nbillion at March 31, 2021. This scenario was\nnot our expectation at March 31, 2021 and does\nnot reflect our current expectation, nor does\nit capture all the potential unknown variables\nthat would likely arise over 2021, but it\nprovides an approximation of a possible\noutcome under hypothetical severe conditions.\nThe CECL methodology inherently requires a\nhigh degree of judgment, and as a result, it\nis possible that we may, at another point in\ntime, reach different conclusions regarding\nour credit loss estimates\n\nSee the following for additional details on\nthe components of our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance For Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Financial\nReview, and\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Report.\n\nO FF -B ALANCE S HEET A RRANGEMENTS A ND V\nARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nWe engage in a variety of activities that\ninvolve entities that are not consolidated or\notherwise reflected in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that are generally referred to\nas off-balance sheet arrangements.

concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)\nwere effective as of March 31, 2021, and that\nthere has been no

numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply and\nmarket interest rates,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies\nof the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n\n\u2013 The length and extent of economic\ncontraction as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic,\n\n\u2013 The impact of the results of the recent U.S.\nelections on the regulatory landscape, capital\nmarkets, and the response to and management of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including the\neffectiveness of already-enacted fiscal\nstimulus from the federal government and a\npotential infrastructure bill, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour view that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2013 Despite the improvement in the economy since\nthe spring of 2020, economic activity remains\nbelow its pre-pandemic level and unemployment\nremains elevated.\n\n\u2013 Growth will pick up in the spring of 2021 as\nvaccine distribution continues and the federal\ngovernment provides aid to households, small\nand medium-sized businesses, and state and\nlocal governments. PNC expects real GDP to\nreturn to its pre-pandemic level in the third\nquarter of 2021, and employment in the second\nhalf of 2022.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25 %\nuntil at least late 2023.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding a stress capital buffer established\nby the Federal Reserve Board in connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process.\nThe Federal Reserve also has imposed\nadditional limitations on capital\ndistributions through the second quarter of\n2021 by CCAR-participating bank holding\ncompanies.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n44 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our planned acquisition of BBVA presents us\nwith risks and uncertainties related both to\nthe acquisition transaction itself and to the\nintegration of the acquired business into PNC\nafter closing:\n\n\u2013 The business of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, going forward\nmay not perform as we currently project or in\na manner consistent with historical\nperformance. As a result, the anticipated\nbenefits, including estimated cost savings, of\nthe transaction may be significantly more\ndifficult or take longer to achieve than\nexpected or may not be achieved in their\nentirety as a result of unexpected factors or\nevents, including those that are outside of\nour control.\n\n\u2013 The combination of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with PNC and PNC\nBank, respectively, may be more difficult to\nachieve than anticipated or have unanticipated\nadverse results relating to BBVA, including\nits U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, or our\nexisting businesses.\n\n\u2013 Completion of the transaction is dependent\non the satisfaction of customary closing\nconditions, which cannot be assured. The\ntiming of completion of the transaction is\ndependent on various factors that cannot be\npredicted with precision at this point.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the planned BBVA transaction,\nwe grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, and the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures, security\nbreaches, cyberattacks or international\nhostilities through impacts on the economy and\nfinancial markets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2020 Form 10-K\nand elsewhere in this Report, including in the\nRisk Factors and Risk Management sections and\nthe Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nin these reports.

banking,\nincluding residential mortgage, corporate and\ninstitutional banking and asset management,\nproviding many of our products and services\nnationally. Our retail branch network is\nlocated primarily in markets across the Mid-\nAtlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have\nstrategic international offices in four\ncountries outside the U.S.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  1 A                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING P OLICIES                         \n                                              \nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of the parent company and its\nsubsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned,\ncertain partnership interests and VIEs.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to\npresent fairly our results for the interim\nperiods. The results of operations for interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the full year\nor any other interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2020 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2020 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements. There have been no significant\nchanges to our accounting policies as\ndisclosed in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements.

Additionally, PNC\ncontributed 500,000BlackRock shares to the PNC\nFoundation.\n\nFollowing the sale and donation, PNC has\ndivested its entire investment in BlackRock\nand only holds shares of BlackRock stock in a\nfiduciary capacity for clients of PNC.\n\nThe following table summarizes the results\nfrom the discontinued operations of BlackRock\nincluded in the Consolidated Income Statement:\n\nTable 34: Consolidated Income Statement -\nDiscontinued Operations\n                                              \n                          Three months ended  \n                                    March 31  \n  In millions                           2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Noninterest          $                 181  \n  income                                      \n  Total revenue                          181  \n  Income from                                 \n  discontinued                                \n  operations before                      181  \n  income taxes and                            \n  noncontrolling                              \n  interests                                   \n  Income taxes                            25  \n  Net income from                             \n  discontinued         $                 156  \n  operations                                  \n                                              \nThe net cash provided by operating activities\nof discontinued operations was $ 126million\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2020 and\nis included in the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 53\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  3 I                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  NVESTMENT S ECURITIES                       \n                                              \nThe following table summarizes our available\nfor sale and held to maturity portfolios by\nmajor security type:\n\nTable 35: Investment Securities Summary\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) The accrued interest associated with our\navailable for sale portfolio totaled $\n244million and $ 238million at March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively. These\namounts are included in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 105million and $ 79million for\nsecurities available for sale at March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(c) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. 85% of our securities held to\nmaturity were rated AAA/AA as of both March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Shareholders\u2019 equity as\nAOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at March 31, 2021\nincluded $ 1.8billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for March 31, 2020 was $\n0.4billion.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date based\non estimation of expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. As of March 31, 2021, the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 108million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The provision for credit\nlosses on investment securities totaled $\n26million for the three months ended March 31,\n2021.\n\nTable 36 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities as of March 31,\n2021. These securities are segregated between\ninvestments that had been in a continuous\nunrealized loss position for less than twelve\nmonths and twelve months or more, based on the\npoint in time that the fair value declined\nbelow the amortized cost basis.

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nThe following table presents the composition\nand delinquency status of our loan portfolio\nat March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in\nApril 2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the\ndelinquency status of loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships aligns with the\nrules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the contractual\nterms of the loan, even where borrowers may\nnot be making payments on their loans during\nthe modification period. Loan modifications\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate or the principal balance of a\nloan do not qualify for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act or the interagency guidance.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 57\nTable 40: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) (b)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table represent loans held for\ninvestment and do not include any associated\nvaluation allowance.\n(b) The accrued interest associated with our\nloan portfolio totaled $ 0.7billion at both\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and is\nincluded in Other assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n(c) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed Residential real estate\nloans and Education loans totaling $\n0.4billion and $ 0.1billion at March 31, 2021.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2020 were $\n0.4billion and $ 0.2billion.\n(d) Consumer loans accounted for under the\nfair value option for which we do not expect\nto collect substantially all principal and\ninterest are subject to nonaccrual accounting\nand classification upon meeting any of our\nnonaccrual policies.

This decrease in\nreserves was primarily attributable to the\nimproved economic outlook and portfolio\nchanges, partially offset by increases in\nqualitative factor reserves due to portfolio\nsensitivity from specific customers and\nsegments still impacted by the pandemic. The\nfollowing summarizes the changes in these\nfactors that influenced the current ACL:\n\n\u2022 The economic scenarios used for the period\nended March 31, 2021 were designed to reflect\nan improved near-term economic outlook in\ncomparison to the scenarios used for the\nperiod ended December 31, 2020. This\nimprovement was the result of declining\nCOVID-19 cases, more rapid vaccine\ndistribution, the passage of the American\nRescue Plan stimulus package and economic\nmomentum fueled by increased consumer\nspending.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio changes primarily reflecting\ndecreases in both commercial and consumer loan\nbalances drove reserve declines at March 31,\n2021. Declines were attributable to lower\nutilization of loan commitments and softer\nloan production in the commercial portfolio\nand paydowns outpacing new originations in the\nconsumer portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Increases in qualitative factor reserves at\nMarch 31, 2021 were attributable to the\nconsiderable uncertainty that remains\nregarding overall lifetime loss content for\nboth our commercial and consumer portfolios,\nspecifically as it relates to our customers\nthat are less likely to benefit from the\neconomic recovery currently underway. For\ncommercial borrowers, there are concerns\naround industries that are dependent on in-\nperson gatherings, hospitality and tourism.\nFor consumer borrowers, payment behavior once\nthe government stimulus wanes is also\ndifficult to predict.\n\nThe ACL at March 31, 2020 totaled $\n4.4billion, a $ 1.3billion increase in\nreserves compared to December 31, 2019. This\nincrease reflected the day-one CECL transition\nadjustment along with the significantly\nadverse economic impacts of the pandemic and\nits resulting effects on credit quality and\nloan growth in the first quarter of 2020.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 65\nN OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nAs more fully described in Note 5 Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities and Variable Interest\nEntities in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we\nhave transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement.

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 49\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is not significant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE. In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 49. These loans are\nincluded as part of the asset quality\ndisclosures that we make in Note 4 Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses.\nTable 49: Non-Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                       \u2026               \u2026      \n                       \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       \u2026    $  1         \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026            $  \u2026         \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       \u2026    $  1         \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026            $  \u2026         \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans, investments and other\nassets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net\nof collateral (if applicable).

MSRs are purchased or\noriginated when loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 1.7billion and $\n1.2billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively, and consisted of loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential mortgages measured at fair value.\n\nMSRs are subject to declines in value from\nactual or expected prepayment of the\nunderlying loans and defaults, as well as\nmarket driven changes in interest rates. We\nmanage this risk by economically hedging the\nfair value of MSRs with securities and\nderivative instruments which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 67\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 6 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 51 and 52. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions.\n\nTable 51: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key

Approximately 97% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass as of March 31, 2021, with the\nremainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them. The standby\nletters of credit outstanding on March 31,\n2021 had terms ranging from less than one\nyearto six years.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, assets of $ 1.3billion\nsecured certain specifically identified\nstandby letters of credit. In addition, a\nportion of the remaining standby letters of\ncredit issued on behalf of specific customers\nis also secured by collateral or guarantees\nthat secure the customers\u2019 other obligations\nto us. The carrying amount of the liability\nfor our obligations related to standby letters\nof credit and participations in standby\nletters of credit was $ 0.1billion at March\n31, 2021 and is included in

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate, and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow March 31, 2021,\nwe expect to reclassify an insignificant\namount of net derivative gains from AOCI to\ninterest income for these cash flow hedge\nstrategies. This reclassified amount could\ndiffer from amounts actually recognized due to\nchanges in interest rates, hedge de-\ndesignations, and the addition of other hedges\nsubsequent to March 31, 2021. As of March 31,\n2021, the maximum length of time over which\nforecasted transactions are hedged is ten\nyears.\nFurther detail regarding gains (losses)\nrelated to our fair value and cash flow

OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\nTable 71: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt March 31, 2021, we held cash, U.S.\ngovernment securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities totaling $ 1.5billion under master\nnetting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties, and we pledged\ncash\n\n86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\ntotaling $ 2.0billion under these agreements\nto collateralize net derivative liabilities\nowed to counterparties and to meet initial\nmargin requirements. These totals may differ\nfrom the amounts presented in the preceding\noffsetting table because these totals may\ninclude collateral exchanged under an\nagreement that does not qualify as a master\nnetting agreement or because the total amount\nof collateral held or pledged exceeds the net\nderivative fair values with the counterparty\nas of the balance sheet date due to timing or\nother factors, such as initial margin. To the\nextent not netted against the derivative fair\nvalues under a master netting agreement, the\nreceivable for cash pledged is included in\nOther assets and the obligation for cash held\nis included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held\nfrom counterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The aggregate fair\nvalue of all derivative instruments with\ncredit-risk-related contingent features that\nwere in a net liability position on March 31,\n2021 was $ 1.8billion for which we had posted\ncollateral of $ 1.3billion in the normal\ncourse of business. The maximum additional\namount of collateral we would have been\nrequired to post if the credit-risk-related\ncontingent features underlying these\nagreements had been triggered on March 31,\n2021 would be $ 0.5billion.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  13 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our\n2020 Form 10-K (such prior disclosure referred\nto as \u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed\nMatters where we are able to estimate such\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses,\nas of March 31, 2021, we estimate that it is\nreasonably possible that we could incur losses\nin excess of related accrued liabilities, if\nany, in an aggregate amount less than $\n100million. The estimates included in this\namount are based on our analysis of currently\navailable information and are subject to\nsignificant judgment and a variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties. As new\ninformation is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item\n8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we are unable, at\nthis time, to estimate the losses that are\nreasonably possible to be incurred or ranges\nof such losses with respect to some of the\nmatters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated\namount provided above does not include an\nestimate for every Disclosed Matter.\nTherefore, as the estimated aggregate amount\ndisclosed above does not include all of the\nDisclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above\ndoes not represent our maximum reasonably\npossible loss exposure for all of the\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn January 2021, USAA filed a motion to\ndismiss or transfer PNC Bank\u2019s declaratory\njudgment complaint in PNC Bank, N.A. v. United\nServices Automobile Association (Case No.\n2:20-cv-1886), pending in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of\nPennsylvania.\n\nIn February 2021, in United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 2:20-cv-319), pending in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas, we answered the amended complaint and\nasserted counterclaims alleging that the\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 87\nplaintiff infringed four patents owned by PNC\nBank, as well as for a declaratory judgment\nthat PNC Bank does not infringe certain\npatents asserted by the plaintiff. In March\n2021, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss\ntwo of the patent infringement\n\ncounterclaims, as well as to sever the patent\ninfringement counterclaims for trial.\n\nIn March 2021, USAA filed another lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A. (Case No. 2:21-cv-110)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement. The complaint alleges that PNC\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit capture systems infringe\ntwo patents owned by the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff seeks, among other things, a\njudgment that PNC is infringing each of the\npatents, damages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. On April 19, 2021, we moved\nto consolidate this action with the other\naction brought by USAA pending in the same\ndistrict. On April 22, 2021, we filed motions\nto dismiss and transfer this action.\n\nOther Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad range of\nissues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage,\nsecurities and other financial services\nbusinesses, as well as other aspects of our\noperations. In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of reviews of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries have involved\nand may in the future involve or lead to\nregulatory enforcement actions and other\nadministrative proceedings. These inquiries\nhave also led to and may in the future lead to\ncivil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some\nof these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries, including those\ndescribed in Prior Disclosure.\nOther\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock,\nwhich had previously been reported as a\nseparate business segment.

Assets, revenue and earnings\nattributable to foreign activities were not\nmaterial in the periods presented for\ncomparison.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstand-alone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology.

As\nsuch, these tax-exempt instruments typically\nyield lower returns than taxable investments.\nTo provide more meaningful comparisons of net\ninterest income, we use interest income on a\ntaxable-equivalent basis by increasing the\ninterest income earned on tax-exempt assets to\nmake it fully equivalent to interest income\nearned on taxable investments.\n                                              \n  G                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  LOSSARY                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EFINED                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  T                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ERMS                                        \n                                              \nFor a glossary of terms commonly used in our\nfilings, please see the glossary of terms\nincluded in our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CRONYMS                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n              Allowance             Loss      \n  ACL         for          LGD      given     \n              credit                default   \n              losses                          \n              Allowance             London    \n  ALLL        for loan     LIBOR    Interba\u2026  \n              and lease             Offered   \n              losses                Rate      \n              Accumula\u2026             Low       \n              other                 income    \n  AOCI        comprehe\u2026    LIHTC    housing   \n              income                tax       \n                                    credit    \n              Accounti\u2026             Limited   \n  ASC         Standards    LLC      liabili\u2026  \n              Codifica\u2026             company   \n              Available             Loan-to\u2026  \n  ASF         stable       LTV      ratio     \n              funding                         \n                                    Managem\u2026  \n                                    Discuss\u2026  \n                                    and       \n                                    Analysis  \n              Accounti\u2026             of        \n  ASU         Standards    MD&A     Financi\u2026  \n              Update                Conditi\u2026  \n                                    and       \n                                    Results   \n                                    of        \n                                    Operati\u2026  \n              BBVA USA              Mortgage  \n  BBVA        Bancshar\u2026    MSR      servici\u2026  \n              Inc.                  right     \n              Banco                 North     \n  BBVA,       Bilbao                American  \n  S.A.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of\n\ncommon stock repurchases depending on a number\nof factors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative\n\nuses of capital, the potential impact on our\ncredit ratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy\n\nand capital planning processes undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR\nprocess. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a\ntemporary suspension of our common stock\nrepurchase program in conjunction with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s effort to support the U.S.\neconomy during the pandemic. We continued the\nsuspension through the first quarter of 2021,\nwith the exception of employee benefit-related\npurchases in the third quarter of 2020,\nconsistent with extension of the Federal\nReserves's special capital distribution\nrestrictions. We expect to continue to refrain\nfrom share repurchases for the remainder of\nthe period leading up to the close of our\npending BBVA transaction. Following the close,\nPNC expects to resume repurchases in the\nsecond half of 2021.\n\n96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 6.
