The board would  \nlike to acknowledge and thank PNC\u2019s employees \nfor all their contributions to this strong    \nperformance. As we progressed through this    \nnotable year, the board remained closely      \nconnected to company management. Through our  \nregular engagement and established board      \ncommittees, we continued to provide oversight \ninto the development and execution of company \nstrategy and helped ensure management         \ndecisions aligned to that strategy. We        \nrecently welcomed Douglas Dachille to the     \nboard. With experience spanning three decades,\nDouglas brings a unique perspective of the    \nfinancial services sector. As you will read   \nwithin this proxy statement, all of the       \nindependent directors nominated for election  \nthis year come from widely varied backgrounds.\nEach of us brings a unique set of perspectives\nand expertise to our conversations with       \nmanagement, which we believe makes us more    \neffective in providing strategic counsel and  \nrecommendations. I, along with my fellow      \nindependent directors, share PNC Chairman and \nCEO Bill Demchak\u2019s excitement about the growth\nopportunities ahead. The company is favorably \npositioned to capitalize on its strategic     \npriorities, and to continue delivering for all\nof its stakeholders.

The   \n        Board and our executive management    \n        strive to ensure PNC has a sound      \n        risk culture that reinforces the      \n        appropriate protocols for             \n        responsible and ethical behavior.     \n        The Board and executive management    \n        have mandated the establishment of    \n  \u25fe    structural governance tools to guide  \n        and reinforce desired behaviors,      \n        such as corporate values, a code of   \n        conduct, a performance management     \n        system applicable to all employees    \n        and an enterprise-wide risk           \n        governance framework (the \u201cERM        \n        Framework\u201d) that guides the           \n        objectives and design of our risk     \n        management processes.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n        Monitor enterprise strategy and risk  \n        parameters. The Board is responsible  \n        for overseeing PNC\u2019s strategic        \n        planning process and management\u2019s     \n        implementation of the resulting       \n        strategic plan. The core components   \n        of PNC\u2019s overall enterprise strategy  \n        are subject to Board review and       \n        approval at least annually. Those     \n        core components consist of strategic  \n        planning, liquidity planning and      \n        stress-testing processes, all of      \n  \u25fe    which are reviewed and approved by    \n        the full Board; and risk appetite,    \n        which is reviewed and approved by     \n        the Board through its Risk            \n        Committee. Management provides the    \n        Board with periodic updates on PNC\u2019s  \n        strategic plans and emerging          \n        strategic matters. The Board may      \n        require management to adjust the      \n        strategic plan to reflect current     \n        conditions in connection with         \n        changes in PNC\u2019s risk profile or      \n        operating environment.                \n                                              \n                                              \n        Apply independent judgment. The       \n        Board oversees risk-taking            \n        activities, holds management          \n        accountable for adhering to the ERM   \n  \u25fe    Framework and is responsible for      \n        exercising sound, independent         \n        judgment when assessing risk. Among   \n        other things, the Board is expected   \n        to oversee PNC\u2019s strategic planning   \n        process by:                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2013  Reviewing and approving the strategic    \n     plan annually;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Providing appropriate challenge to       \n  \u2013  management\u2019s assumptions and             \n     recommendations;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Understanding the risks associated with  \n  \u2013  the success and potential failure of     \n     the strategic plan; and                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Overseeing management\u2019s actions and      \n  \u2013  decisions for consistency with PNC\u2019s     \n     strategic plan.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Our enterprise and line of business         \n  strategic plans outline the major           \n  objectives, strategies and goals that are   \n  expected to be achieved over the next       \n  five years while seeking to ensure we       \n  remain compliant with all capital, risk     \n  appetite and liquidity targets and          \n  guidelines.

It consists of seven  \n  core                                        \n  components that provide executive           \n  management and                              \n  the Board with an aggregate view of the     \n  significant risks impacting the             \n  organization.                               \n  Those core components are:                  \n  risk culture, enterprise strategy           \n  (including risk                             \n  appetite, strategic planning, capital and   \n  liquidity planning, and stress testing),    \n  risk                                        \n  governance and oversight, risk              \n  identification,                             \n  risk assessments, risk controls and         \n  monitoring,                                 \n  and risk aggregation and reporting.         \n  Because we                                  \n  seek to manage PNC for the long term, our   \n  ERM                                         \n  Framework and risk appetite primarily       \n  address our                                 \n  longer-term strategic risks as understood,  \n  analyzed and quantified through all phases  \n  of the                                      \n  economic cycle. However, a significant      \n  focus is                                    \n  also applied to specific risks, such as     \n  credit,                                     \n  operational (including compliance and       \n  information                                 \n  security), liquidity and market risks,      \n  that could                                  \n  have a material impact in the short- or     \n  medium-term. The ERM Framework and related  \n  enterprise policies are subject to review   \n  and                                         \n  approval by the Board\u2019s Risk Committee at   \n  least                                       \n  annually.                                   \n                                              \nIRM organization PNC\u2019s IRM organization is    \norganized into distinct risk areas and employs\na tiered governance structure of management-  \nlevel committees to support business oversight\nand decision-making. The purpose of the       \ncommittee structure is to enable oversight of \nbusiness activities at a more granular level  \nand help ensure that policies defined by our  \nERM Framework are followed and that business  \ndecisions are made and executed consistent    \nwith the Board\u2019s desired risk profile. The    \nChief Risk Officer leads the IRM organization \nand is a member of the MEC.The Chief Risk     \nOfficer also chairs the management-level      \nEnterprise Risk Management Committee (the     \n\u201cERMC\u201d), which is responsible for reporting to\nthe MEC on key enterprise risk issues. The    \nERMC provides executive-level oversight of    \nrisk management, including the implementation \nof the ERM Framework and the enterprise risk  \nprofile across PNC\u2019s lines of business, and   \nemerging risk trends and issues. The IRM      \norganization regularly engages external       \nparties, both formally and informally, to help\nensure emerging risks and trends are          \nidentified and considered in our ongoing risk \nidentification, assessment, monitoring and    \nreporting frameworks. Engagements with        \nexternal parties include memberships in       \nindustry trade groups, consultations with     \nindustry experts and formal engagements with  \nindependent consultants. As new or emerging   \nrisks are identified, PNC evaluates the       \ncomprehensiveness of our existing ERM         \nFramework to identify, assess, monitor and    \nmanage those risks. The Board\u2019s Risk Committee\nreceives regular reports from the Chief Risk  \nOfficer and PNC\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer    \n(who is a member of the Chief Risk Officer\u2019s  \nIRM organization) on matters such as PNC\u2019s    \nrisk profile; significant existing, new or    \nemerging risks; significant initiatives to    \nidentify, assess, monitor and manage such     \nrisks; and the functioning of the IRM         \norganization.

Below is a summary of how\nthe Board conducts its oversight function in  \nselected key areas. Cybersecurity and         \ntechnology The use of technology is critical  \nto our ability to maintain or enhance the     \ncompetitiveness of our business. The proper   \nfunctioning and resiliency of our information \nsystems and other technology has become more  \nimportant and more challenging. The Board     \nmaintains governance and oversight of the     \nrisks posed by cybersecurity threats and use  \nof technology through its Risk Committee and  \nTechnology Committee. The Risk Committee      \noversees PNC\u2019s ERM Framework, which includes  \ncybersecurity risk, as represented by the     \nInformation Security domain, alongside seven  \nother operational risk domains. The Chief Risk\nOfficer reports quarterly to the Risk         \nCommittee on overall risks across the ERM     \nFramework. The Technology Committee (1)       \nassists the Board with the oversight of       \ntechnology strategy and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs, including those that\ncan position the use of technology to drive   \nstrategic advantages, and (2) provides Board- \nlevel oversight of technology risk,           \ninformation management and security risks     \n(including data risk, cybersecurity, cyber    \nfraud and physical security risks), and the   \nadequacy of PNC\u2019s business recovery,          \nresiliency and contingency plans and test     \nresults. The Technology Committee is informed \nof cyber threats and risks through multiple   \nmechanisms:                                   \n                                              \n        The Chief Information Security        \n        Officer presents quarterly to the     \n        Technology Committee on such topics   \n        as threat intelligence and            \n  \u25fe    assessment reports, incident and      \n        event reporting from other            \n        institutions, governance and          \n        regulatory exam status and the        \n        status of other key program           \n        deliverables, among other content.    \n                                              \n                                              \n        The Chief Technology Risk Officer     \n        presents quarterly to the Technology  \n        Committee on inherent information     \n  \u25fe    security risks, the maturity and      \n        completeness of the control           \n        environment and measurements against  \n        our risk appetite.                    \n                                              \nHuman capital management and executive        \nsuccession planning Part of our ability to    \ncompete effectively depends on our ability to \nattract new employees and develop and retain  \nour existing employees. Our access to talent  \nis critical as we seek to expand into new     \nmarkets, develop new product lines or enhance \nstaffing in certain areas, particularly       \ntechnology. As part of its role in risk       \noversight, the Board is responsible for       \nreviewing and approving PNC\u2019s talent          \nmanagement program. The Board has delegated to\nthe HR Committee responsibility for oversight \nof PNC\u2019s programs, policies and practices     \nrelated to talent and human capital strategy; \nthe recruitment, development, retention and   \nadvancement of talent; employee engagement,   \nhealth, safety and well-being; and corporate  \nculture. The Board also works with the HR     \nCommittee to review and evaluate the          \ndevelopment of the executive management       \nsuccession plan for potential successors to   \nthe CEO and other executive officers          \n(excluding the General Auditor and Chief Risk \nOfficer, whose succession planning is handled \nby the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee,\nrespectively). At least annually, the HR      \nCommittee reviews a succession planning report\nfrom PNC\u2019s talent management function. The    \nreport typically includes a discussion of the \nindividual performance of each executive      \nofficer, as well as succession plans and      \ndevelopment initiatives for other emerging    \ntalent. Our CEO also contributes his          \nrecommendations and evaluations of potential  \nsuccessors and guidance on the development    \nplans for those individuals. The executive    \nmanagement succession plan, including for the \nCEO, is reviewed with the full Board from time\nto time. Succession planning encompasses both \nlong-term succession scenarios and            \ncontingencies or unplanned scenarios.         \n                                              \n  32    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nBOARD\u2019S ROLE IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Climate- \nrelated risks We recognize that environmental \nissues, such as climate change, could pose    \nfinancial, legal and reputational risk to PNC.\nClimate change-related risks could adversely  \naffect our business and performance, including\nindirectly through impacts on our customers.  \nOur governance of climate issues seeks to     \nensure an appropriate balancing of            \nenvironmental considerations with other       \norganizational priorities as we pursue our    \npurpose of helping all of our stakeholders    \nmove forward financially. PNC maintains a     \nmanagement-level committee chaired by the     \nChief Risk Officer that is tasked with        \noverseeing the integration of climate-related \nrisks into PNC\u2019s ERM Framework, aggregation of\nclimate-related risk across the individual    \nrisk disciplines to assess the overall impact \nto the organization and effectiveness of the  \nmitigation strategies, and implementation of  \nrisk management activities consistent with    \nclimate risk-related regulatory rules,        \nguidance or legislation. PNC also has an      \nestablished risk management framework that    \nhelps identify, assess, monitor and report on \nenvironmental risks, including those related  \nto climate change. Given the highly integrated\nnature of environmental concerns, including   \nsignificant climate change issues, the full   \nBoard oversees these matters as informed by   \ninsights from its committees, particularly the\nRisk Committee, whose purview includes risks  \nflowing from environmental, human rights and  \nreputational matters, along with the principal\nrisk types associated with PNC\u2019s business     \nactivities. Board leadership The Board strives\nto maintain a governing structure that enables\nappropriate Board oversight of PNC\u2019s business,\noperations and enterprise strategy.

The Board may choose a different        \nleadership structure if circumstances lead the\nBoard to conclude that a different leadership \nstructure would better serve the long-term    \ninterests of the Company and our shareholders.\nThe Board determines whether to separate the  \nChair and CEO positions as necessary or       \nappropriate, in its judgment, including but   \nnot limited to when selecting a new CEO. The  \nBoard considers a range of factors, including:\n(1) the individuals serving in the roles of   \nCEO, Chair and Presiding Director and their   \nrecord of leadership and performance in those \nroles; (2) the composition of the Board; (3)  \nPNC\u2019s operating and financial performance and \nstrategic plans; (4) any recent or anticipated\nchanges in the CEO role; (5) the effectiveness\nof the processes and structures for Board     \ninteraction with and oversight of management; \nand (6) the importance of maintaining a single\nvoice in leadership communications and Board  \noversight, both internally and with           \nshareholders and other stakeholders.          \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             33  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nBOARD\u2019S ROLE IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Current  \nleadership structure The Board believes the   \ninterests of our shareholders are best served \nat this time through the current combined     \nChair and CEO leadership structure, in        \nconjunction with a Presiding Director who has \nrobust oversight and board governance         \nresponsibilities.

These annual self-evaluations  \nare designed to provide a regular, formalized \nprocess for the members of the Board and its  \ncommittees to provide feedback on various     \nfactors relating to Board or committee        \neffectiveness, as applicable. Feedback is     \nobtained through discussions among the members\nof the Board and the members of the individual\ncommittees, as applicable, and summarized to  \nthe Board and the N&G Committee for their     \nreview and consideration. Appropriate action  \nplans are then developed to implement         \nenhancements and other changes based on the   \nfeedback received. Matters considered in the  \nself-evaluation include, among other things,  \ngovernance, meeting materials and other       \naspects of Board operations, and oversight of \nstrategy, risk and executive succession       \nplanning.                                     \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             41  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nBOARD\u2019S ROLE IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE          \nRetirement age The Board has not established  \nterm limits for directors. The Board believes \nthat term limits prevent valuable             \ncontributions from directors who have         \ndeveloped increasing insight into PNC over the\ncourse of their tenure. The Board has         \nestablished a mandatory retirement age. A     \nperson who is age 75 or older may not be      \nappointed to the Board or be nominated for    \nelection or reelection as a director at the   \nnext annual meeting of shareholders after his \nor her 75th birthday (subject to the Board\u2019s  \ndetermination that a waiver of the mandatory  \nretirement age is in the best interests of PNC\nand its shareholders). Limitations on outside \nboard service A director must advise the Board\nChair or the N&G Committee chair before       \naccepting an invitation to (1) serve on       \nanother public company board of directors, (2)\nchair or serve as lead independent director of\nanother public company board, or (3) chair the\naudit committee or compensation committee of  \nanother public company board. The Board       \nbelieves that there should be an opportunity  \nto review a director\u2019s availability to fulfill\nhis or her responsibilities as a PNC director \nif he or she serves on more than three other  \npublic company boards.                        \n                                              \n  42    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCommunicating with the Board                  \n                                              \n  u Shareholders and                          \n  other interested                            \n  parties who wish                            \n  to communicate        To contact the Board  \n  with the              or any Board          \n  Board, any            member(s), send an    \n  director              email or letter to:   \n  (including the        PNC Board of          \n  Presiding             Directors c/o         \n  Director), the        Corporate Secretary   \n  non-management        The PNC Financial     \n  or independent        Services Group, Inc.  \n  directors as a        300 Fifth Avenue      \n  group, or             Pittsburgh,           \n  any Board             Pennsylvania          \n  committee, may        15222-2401 Email:     \n  send an email         corporate.secretary\u2026  \n  or a letter in                              \n  care of the                                 \n  Corporate                                   \n  Secretary.                                  \n                                              \nThe Corporate Secretary will process such     \ncommunications as set forth herein.

A related person \ntransaction is generally any transaction in   \nwhich (1) PNC or its subsidiaries is or will  \nbe a participant, (2) the amount involved     \nexceeds $120,000 and (3) a director or        \nnominee, executive officer, family member or  \nany beneficial owner of more than 5% of our   \ncommon stock has or will have a direct or     \nindirect material interest. PNC\u2019s Related     \nPerson Transactions Policy provides as        \nfollows:                                      \n                                              \n        A related person transaction may be   \n        completed or shall continue only if   \n        the appropriate Board committee       \n        approves the transaction as not       \n  \u25fe    inconsistent with the interests of    \n        PNC and its shareholders, and the     \n        transaction is on terms comparable    \n        to those that could be obtained in    \n        arm\u2019s length dealings with an         \n        unrelated third party.                \n                                              \n                                              \n        The Presiding Director shall assign   \n        responsibility for reviewing the      \n        transaction to the full Board, a      \n  \u25fe    Board committee solely composed of    \n        independent directors, or such PNC    \n        officers or management-level          \n        committee as the Presiding Director   \n        determines to be appropriate.         \n                                              \n                                              \n        In general, a potential related       \n        person transaction that involves a    \n        director shall be reviewed by the     \n        N&G Committee, as the transaction     \n  \u25fe    could also impact independence. A     \n        transaction that involves an          \n        executive officer or beneficial       \n        owner of more than 5% of our common   \n        stock shall be reviewed by the Audit  \n        Committee.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n        Approval or disapproval of each       \n  \u25fe    related person transaction shall be   \n        reported to the full Board.           \n                                              \nThe Audit Committee and the N&G Committee have\ndetermined that certain types of transactions \ndo not create or involve a direct or indirect \nmaterial interest on the part of the related  \nperson and therefore do not require review or \napproval under the Related Person Transactions\nPolicy. These include, for example:           \n                                              \n        Indebtedness due from the related     \n        person for purchases of goods and     \n        services subject to usual trade       \n  \u25fe    terms, for ordinary business travel   \n        and expense payments and for other    \n        transactions in the ordinary course   \n        of business;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n        Loans or other extensions of credit   \n        from PNC\u2019s bank subsidiary, provided  \n        that the loans are not disclosed as   \n  \u25fe    nonaccrual, past due, restructured    \n        or potential problems and comply      \n        with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s      \n        Regulation O;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n        Capital market transactions,          \n        financial services and financial      \n        advisory services, where the pricing  \n  \u25fe    and terms of such transactions are    \n        comparable to those which could be    \n        obtained inarm\u2019s-lengthdealings with  \n        an unrelated party; and               \n                                              \n                                              \n        Cash management services, overdraft   \n        facilities, credit facilities,        \n        foreign exchange transactions,        \n        investment brokerage, securities      \n        reverse repurchase transactions,      \n  \u25fe    clearing and settlement services,     \n        syndicated loan agency and other      \n        ordinary course products and          \n        services provided on terms that are   \n        consistent with market terms for      \n        such products and services.           \n                                              \n                                              \n  46    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-2025 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nMANAGING WITH INTEGRITY Certain transactions  \nand relationships During 2024, in the ordinary\ncourse of business, PNC or its subsidiaries   \nengaged in transactions with or involving     \nBlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates            \n(\u201cBlackRock\u201d) or The Vanguard Group, Inc. and \nits affiliates (\u201cVanguard\u201d), as summarized    \nbelow. According to their respective Schedule \n13G/A filings with the SEC, BlackRock and     \nVanguard each beneficially own more than 5% of\nthe outstanding shares of PNC common stock. We\nbelieve our transactions with BlackRock and   \nVanguard reflect market terms and conditions. \n                                              \n        We provide ordinary course lending,   \n        treasury management, capital markets  \n        and other financial services to       \n        BlackRock and Vanguard. In addition,  \n        we may trade with, invest in, cause   \n        our clients to invest in or offer     \n  \u25fe    BlackRock or Vanguard mutual funds    \n        or other investment products to our   \n        clients. BlackRock serves as an       \n        asset manager for our pension plan    \n        and voluntary employees\u2019 beneficiary  \n        association, and for certain          \n        investment options under our 401(k)   \n        plan.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n        We use a central processing system    \n        offered by BlackRock for enterprise   \n        investment management and related     \n        services, such as risk analytics,     \n  \u25fe    portfolio management compliance and   \n        operational processing, and paid      \n        approximately $6.0\u00a0million based on   \n        volume to BlackRock in 2024 for use   \n        of this system.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n        We engage in distribution,            \n        shareholder servicing and marketing   \n  \u25fe    support activities relating to        \n        BlackRock funds. In 2024 our fees     \n        from those activities were            \n        approximately $5.1\u00a0million.           \n                                              \n                                              \n        We participate in two syndicated      \n        credit facilities to Vanguard and     \n        Vanguard-managed funds. These credit  \n        transactions were made on             \n        substantially the same terms,         \n  \u25fe    including interest rates and          \n        collateral, as those prevailing at    \n        the time for comparable facilities    \n        with persons not related to PNC, and  \n        did not involve more than the normal  \n        risk of collectability.               \n                                              \nIn the ordinary course of business, PNC also  \nmay provide loans, other extensions of credit \nor other banking or financial services to     \ndirectors and executive officers of PNC and   \ntheir immediate family members and affiliated \nentities. Loans or other extensions of credit \nto the foregoing parties are subject to our   \ninternal policies and procedures relating to  \nthe Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation O      \nwhich, among other things, prohibits banks    \nfrom giving preferential treatment to         \ndirectors and executive officers when         \nextending credit. Family relationships PNC and\nits subsidiaries employ more than 55,000      \nemployees, and some employees may be an       \nimmediate family member of an executive       \nofficer, director or director nominee of PNC. \nSuch employees participate in compensation and\nincentive plans or arrangements on the same   \nbasis as other similarly situated employees.  \nWe identify below PNC\u2019s employment            \nrelationships with such \u201cimmediate family     \nmembers,\u201d as defined by SEC regulations, in   \ncases where the family member\u2019s 2024          \ncompensation exceeded $120,000. In each case, \nthe family member is employed in a non-       \nexecutive officer capacity, does not reside in\nthe same household as the PNC insider and does\nnot report directly to a PNC executive        \nofficer.                                      \n                                              \n        Louis Cestello, our head of Regional  \n        Presidents, has abrother-in-lawwho    \n  \u25fe    works in the Corporate\u00a0&              \n        Institutional Banking business        \n        segment.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n        Gregory Jordan, our former General    \n        Counsel and Chief Administrative      \n  \u25fe    Officer, has abrother-in-lawwho       \n        worked in the Retail Banking          \n        business segment during 2024.         \n                                              \n                                              \n        Michael Hannon, our former Chief      \n        Credit Officer, has a son who worked  \n  \u25fe    in the Corporate\u00a0& Institutional      \n        Banking business segment during       \n        2024.                                 \n                                              \nThe employment of a family member of an       \nexecutive officer, director or director       \nnominee and associated compensation is        \nreportable to the Audit Committee or the N&G  \nCommittee, as applicable, and otherwise       \nconsidered to be exempt from the Related      \nPerson Transactions Policy. In accordance with\nthe Related Person Transactions Policy, the   \nAudit Committee reviewed each of the above    \nrelationships.                                \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2025 Proxy                        47  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nMANAGING WITH INTEGRITY Compensation decisions\nThe Board has delegated to the HR Committee   \nand the N&G Committee the responsibility for  \ndetermining the form and amount of            \ncompensation that PNC shall pay to the members\nof executive management (excluding the General\nAuditor and the Chief Risk Officer) and the   \nnon-employeedirectors, respectively. Each of  \nthe HR Committee and the N&G Committee may,   \nwhen deemed appropriate, recommend that the   \nentire Board take action on a particular      \ncompensation decision. The Audit Committee and\nthe Risk Committee (or in the case of equity- \nbased grants, a qualified subcommittee of the \nRisk Committee) have the authority to         \ndetermine and award compensation under PNC\u2019s  \napplicable plans to the General Auditor and   \nthe Chief Risk Officer, respectively. Roles of\nexecutive officers and consultants The HR     \nCommittee and the N&G Committee receive       \nassistance from members of management and     \nexternal compensation consultants in          \ndetermining executives\u2019 and non-              \nemployeedirectors\u2019 compensation. For example, \nthe HR Committee and the N&G Committee        \ntypically obtain comparative compensation     \ndata, which may be prepared by or at the      \ndirection of management based on proxy        \nstatements and other public disclosures or may\nbe provided by compensation consultants in the\nform of surveys and reports. For the 2024     \nperformance year, the HR Committee\u2019s          \nindependent compensation consultant, Meridian \nCompensation Partners, LLC (\u201cMeridian\u201d),      \nprepared discussion materials relating to the \ncompensation of the CEO, which Meridian       \ndiscussed with the HR Committee in executive  \nsession. Meridian also prepared other         \nbenchmarking reviews and pay-for-             \nperformanceanalyses for the HR Committee with \nrespect to the CEO, the CFO and the other     \nNEOs. At least one representative from        \nMeridian attended all meetings of the HR      \nCommittee and met periodically with the HR    \nCommittee without members of management       \npresent. Before each HR Committee meeting, the\nHR Committee chair typically meets with the   \napplicable members of management, including   \nthe Chief Human Resources Officer, and the    \nindependent compensation consultant to discuss\nthe meeting agenda, proposed meeting materials\nand any areas of focus. The HR Committee chair\nmay schedule other meetings with its          \nindependent compensation consultant without   \nmanagement present, as needed. During HR      \nCommittee meetings, the CEO and the Chief     \nHuman Resources Officer often review          \ncorporate, business segment, and individual   \nexecutives\u2019 performance as part of the        \ncompensation discussions and may present their\nviews or recommendations. The HR Committee    \nevaluates those recommendations, generally in \nconsultation with the HR Committee\u2019s          \nindependent compensation consultant. Other    \nmembers of executive management also may be   \ninvited to provide the HR Committee with more \ndetailed information about specific elements  \nof business performance. For example, our     \nChief Risk Officer regularly presents to the  \nHR Committee on the risk performance matters  \nthat are considered in executive compensation \ndeterminations. The HR Committee considers    \ncompensation decisions for the CEO and the    \nChief Human Resources Officer in executive    \nsession, without either officer present for   \nthe discussion of their compensation.         \nDecisions regarding CEO compensation are also \ndiscussed with the full Board in executive    \nsession. HR Committee\u2019s independent consultant\nAs indicated above, the HR Committee retained \nMeridian as its independent compensation      \nconsultant for 2024 to advise on PNC\u2019s        \ncompensation programs for its CEO and other   \nexecutive officers. In this capacity, Meridian\nreported directly to the HR Committee. PNC    \npaid no fees to Meridian in 2024 other than   \nfees paid in connection with the work         \nperformed by Meridian for the HR Committee.   \nThe HR Committee evaluated whether the work of\nMeridian raised any conflicts of interest. The\nHR Committee considered various factors,      \nincluding the six factors mandated by SEC     \nregulations, and determined that no conflict  \nof interest was raised by the work performed  \nby Meridian for the HR Committee.             \n                                              \n  48    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-2025 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nMANAGING WITH INTEGRITY Consultants retained  \nby management Management retains compensation \nconsultants for its own use. In 2024,         \nmanagement retained McLagan to provide certain\nmarket data in the financial services         \nindustry. Management also engaged Willis      \nTowers Watson, a global professional services \nfirm, to provide various actuarial and        \nmanagement consulting services from time to   \ntime. Willis Towers Watson also performed     \nanalyses of the compensation program for our  \nnon-employeedirectors and provided related    \nreports to management and the N&G Committee.  \nOther services that Willis Towers Watson      \nprovided to management in 2024 are listed     \nbelow:                                        \n                                              \n        Prepared specific actuarial           \n  \u25fe    calculations on values under our      \n        retirement plans                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25fe    Prepared surveys of competitive pay   \n        practices                             \n                                              \n                                              \n        Provided insurance brokerage and      \n  \u25fe    consulting services to mitigate       \n        certain property and casualty risks   \n                                              \n                                              \n        Provided guidance on certain aspects  \n  \u25fe    of total rewards, talent management   \n        and other human resources             \n        initiatives                           \n                                              \nReports prepared by Willis Towers Watson and  \nMcLagan that relate to executive compensation \nmay also be shared with the HR Committee.     \nAuthority to delegate compensation decisions  \nto others The HR Committee may delegate to its\nchair or any other persons such power and     \nauthority as the HR Committee deems to be     \nappropriate, except such powers and           \nauthorities required by law to be exercised by\nthe whole committee or by a subcommittee of at\nleast two members. Under their charters, each \nof the HR Committee and the N&G Committee may \nform and delegate its authority to            \nsubcommittees of one or more committee members\nwhen appropriate and as permitted by law.

See \u201cCompensation   \nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d in this proxy        \nstatement and the related compensation tables \nand narrative discussion for information      \nregarding Mr. Demchak\u2019s compensation. Deferred\ncompensation plans Our non-employeedirectors  \nmay choose to defer up to 100% of the cash    \ncompensation they receive (i.e., retainers)   \npursuant to the Directors Deferred            \nCompensation Plan. Under this plan, the       \ndirectors may elect to defer compensation into\nan account that tracks the price of PNC common\nstock or an interest rate defined in the plan.\nThe accounts that track the price of PNC      \ncommon stock are credited with a number of    \nphantom stock units equal to the number of    \nshares (including fractional shares) that     \ncould have been purchased with the equivalent \nof PNC common stock cash dividends that would \nhave been paid on such shares. We do not pay  \nabove-market or preferential earnings on any  \ndirector compensation that is deferred. The   \ndirectors may choose the payout date and      \nwhether the payout, which is made in cash,    \nwill be in a lump sum or up to 10 annual      \ninstallment payments. Under the Outside       \nDirectors Deferred Stock Unit Program, a      \nsubprogram of PNC\u2019s shareholder-approved 2016 \nIncentive Award Plan, each non-               \nemployeedirector is eligible to receive an    \nannual grant of DSUs that vest immediately    \nupon grant and are paid out in shares of PNC  \ncommon stock at retirement or death on a one- \nshareto one-DSUbasis. The number of DSUs      \ngranted is equal to the dollar value specified\nfor the award, divided by the closing price of\na share of PNC common stock on the date of    \ngrant, rounded down to the nearest whole      \nshare. The DSUs accrue dividends with         \nreinvestment equal to the number of DSUs that \ncould have been purchased with the equivalent \nof PNC common stock cash dividends (rounded   \ndown to the nearest whole share). DSUs have no\nvoting rights. The aggregate number of DSUs   \nand phantom stock units that track the price  \nof PNC common stock held by each incumbent    \ndirector pursuant to these deferred           \ncompensation plans is included in \u201cSecurity   \nownership of management and certain beneficial\nowners\u201d in this proxy statement under the     \ncolumns \u201cCommon stock units\u201d and \u201cCash-payable\ncommon stock unit ownership.\u201d All DSUs and    \nphantom stock units are vested. Other benefits\nWe generally limit the benefits we provide to \nnon-employeedirectors, but we regularly       \nprovide the following:                        \n                                              \n        Charitable matching gifts.

In  \nlimited circumstances, we may provide travel  \non corporate aircraft for personal purposes,  \nsuch as when a family emergency arises or a   \nseat is available on a previously scheduled   \nflight.

Under this     \nguideline, each non-employeedirector must own \nshares of PNC common stock (including phantom \nstock units issued pursuant to the Directors  \nDeferred Compensation Plan) with a value of at\nleast five times the value of his or her      \nannual base retainer. Until a director meets  \nthis ownership level, he or she must purchase \nor acquire common stock or stock units that   \nequal at least 25% of the annual retainer for \nthat year. Directors are expected to satisfy  \nthe stock ownership requirement by making open\nmarket purchases or by deferring their cash   \nretainers into phantom stock units under the  \nDirectors Deferred Compensation Plan as       \ndescribed above. As of December 31, 2024, the \nminimum ownership threshold for non-          \nemployeedirectors was valued at $525,000. All \nof our directors serving at that time         \nsatisfied the minimum ownership threshold.    \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             53  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item\u20092 \u2014 Ratification of independent      \u2502\n\u2502  registered public accounting firmRole of  \u2502\n\u2502  the Audit CommitteeThe Audit Committee    \u2502\n\u2502  is responsible for the appointment,       \u2502\n\u2502  compensation, evaluation, retention and   \u2502\n\u2502  oversight of PNC\u2019s independent            \u2502\n\u2502  auditors.The Audit Committee annually     \u2502\n\u2502  evaluates, monitors and reports to the    \u2502\n\u2502  Board on the independence,                \u2502\n\u2502  qualifications and performance of PNC\u2019s   \u2502\n\u2502  independent auditors and the performance  \u2502\n\u2502  of the lead audit partner.

However, the Audit  \u2502\n\u2502  Committee will be under no obligation to  \u2502\n\u2502  select new independent auditors.

Total noninterest expense  \n        decreased 3.5% from 2023, primarily   \n        due to a lower FDIC special           \n  \u25fe    assessment in 2024. Excluding the     \n        impact of the FDIC special            \n        assessment, expenses decreased 1%.    \n        Additionally, in mid-2024 PNC         \n        increased its initial continuous      \n        improvement program (\u201cCIP\u201d) target    \n        by $25\u00a0million to $450\u00a0million and    \n        once again exceeded this target.      \n                                              \n                                              \n        As a result of our record revenue     \n        and strong expense management, PNC    \n  \u25fe    achieved positive operating leverage  \n        in 2024, both on a reported basis     \n        and when adjusted for FDIC            \n        assessment impacts in 2024.           \n                                              \n                                              \n        Throughout 2024 we maintained our     \n        strong balance sheet.

This level of support is        \nconsistent with PNC\u2019s historical levels of    \nsupport for say-on-pay,which, excluding the   \n2023 say-on-payvote, have averaged            \napproximately 94.74% since PNC first reported \nsay-on-payresults in 2010. As previously      \ndisclosed in our 2024 proxy statement,        \nfollowing our 2023 say-on-payvote, we engaged \nin substantial shareholder outreach to seek   \nfeedback on our compensation philosophy and   \nprograms to better understand the decrease in \nshareholder support demonstrated by the 2023  \nsay-on-payvote result of 79.8%. In response to\nthe feedback that our shareholders provided to\nus, we took several actions in 2023, including\nproviding enhanced disclosure and transparency\nwith respect to the HR Committee\u2019s methodology\nfor total compensation decisions. We believe  \nthat our outreach efforts and the subsequent  \nactions taken were meaningful to our          \nshareholders and that the level of shareholder\nsupport for our 2024 say-on-payvote           \ndemonstrates shareholders\u2019 satisfaction with  \nour overall compensation program and practices\nand the disclosure enhancements that we made  \nin response to the 2023 say-on-payvote. For   \nmore information regarding our shareholder    \noutreach efforts and the actions that we took \nfollowing the 2023 say-on-payvote, please see \nour 2024 proxy statement. Throughout 2024, we \ncontinued our outreach on executive           \ncompensation matters, reaching out to our 10  \nlargest shareholders specifically about our   \nexecutive compensation program and practices, \nas a part of the broader shareholder outreach \nefforts as outlined on page 44 of this proxy  \nstatement. Based on the feedback that we      \nreceived during 2023 and early 2024, together \nwith the strong 2024 say-on-payvote result,   \nthe HR Committee determined no significant    \nchanges to the compensation program were      \nnecessary. Specifically, the HR Committee     \nviewed the 2024 say-on-payvote result as      \nsupport for our compensation program and      \npractices. The HR Committee will continue to  \nconsider shareholder feedback and the results \nof the say-on-payvote in its compensation     \ndecisions, in addition to the other factors   \ndiscussed in this CD&A. Our compensation      \nprogram This section discusses how we view    \nexecutive compensation and why we make the    \ndecisions that we do.

The HR    \nCommittee believes that discretion,           \nflexibility and judgment are critical to its  \nability to award incentive compensation that  \nreflects near-term performance results as well\nas progress towards longer-term strategic     \npriorities.

The     \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the\n\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) regulates PNC as a bank    \nholding company and has provided guidance and \nset expectations with respect to our          \ncompensation program. The Office of the       \nComptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d)       \nregulates our primary banking subsidiary and  \nalso sets expectations for our compensation   \nprogram. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and     \nother financial industry regulatory entities, \nincluding the SEC, may provide guidance       \nperiodically on compensation matters. Total   \ncompensation framework To help achieve our    \ncompensation objectives, we evaluate our      \nexecutive pay program and make pay decisions  \nusing a total compensation framework, similar \nto many of our peers.                         \n                                              \n       Each NEO has a total compensation      \n  \u220e    target for the year that consists of   \n       (1)\u00a0a base salary and (2)\u00a0an           \n       incentive compensation target amount.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The HR Committee generally sets these  \n       total compensation targets in the      \n  \u220e    first quarter of the year or when an   \n       executive joins PNC or assumes new     \n       responsibilities.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The incentive compensation target is   \n       composed of annual cash and long-term  \n       equity-based awards, and the HR        \n  \u220e    Committee establishes a specific       \n       minimum percentage of compensation     \n       that will be delivered through         \n       long-term equity-based awards.         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Under our program, the CEO receives    \n       at least 70% of total compensation     \n       (i.e., base salary and incentive       \n       compensation) in the form of           \n  \u220e    long-term equity-based incentive       \n       awards, as illustrated below. All      \n       other NEOs receive at least 50% of     \n       total compensation in the form of      \n       long-term equity-based incentive       \n       awards.                                \n                                              \nOnce the HR Committee sets the total          \ncompensation target, base salary, the only    \nfixed source of cash compensation, is paid    \nduring the performance year. After year-      \nend,what remains to be awarded within the     \ntotal compensation framework is variable      \nincentive compensation\u2014the annual cash        \nincentive award and the long-term equity-based\nincentive award. These amounts are evaluated  \nand approved by the HR Committee during the   \nfirst quarter of the following year, as       \ndiscussed in more detail in \u201c\u20142024 performance\nand compensation decisions\u20142024 incentive     \ncompensation decisions\u201d below.                \n                                              \n  64    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Total    \nincentive compensation evaluated              \ntogether.Under PNC\u2019s total compensation       \nframework, annual cash and long-term incentive\nawards are evaluated together, not as separate\nprograms. The HR Committee makes a single     \ndecision on the level of incentive            \ncompensation to award relative to target      \nincentive compensation based on performance.  \nGiven this structure, the HR Committee cannot \nadjust the annual cash incentive element or   \nthe long-term incentive element without also  \nadjusting the other elements. The HR Committee\nmay, however, increase the percentage of the  \nlong-term incentive award within the overall  \npay mix. Setting total compensation targets As\ndiscussed above, each NEO has a total         \ncompensation target for the year that consists\nof a base salary and an incentive compensation\ntarget (composed of annual cash and long-term \nequity-based awards) which the HR Committee   \nsets during the first quarter of the year or  \nwhen an executive joins PNC or assumes new    \nresponsibilities. The HR Committee believes   \nthe total compensation targets provide an     \nappropriate balance between fixed and variable\namounts, measuring short-term and long-term   \nperformance, immediate and deferred payouts,  \nand cash and equity-based awards. For         \ninformation on how the HR Committee\u2019s 2024    \nincentive compensation decisions compared to  \nthe targets for the 2024 performance year, see\n\u201c\u20142024 performance and compensation           \ndecisions\u20142024 incentive compensation         \ndecisions.\u201d When constructing an appropriate  \ntotal compensation target for an NEO, the HR  \nCommittee uses guidelines consistent with our \ncompensation principles:                      \n                                              \n     We set targets using several factors,    \n     including market data. The HR Committee  \n     reviews available market data but does   \n     not use a formula to set an executive\u2019s  \n     target compensation. The HR Committee    \n  \u220e  evaluates many factors, including the    \n     appropriateness of the job match and     \n     market data, the responsibilities of     \n     the position and the executive\u2019s         \n     demonstrated performance, skills and     \n     experience.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     At least 50% of compensation is          \n     equity-based and not payable for         \n     several years. The HR Committee          \n     believes that a significant portion of   \n     compensation should be at risk or        \n     variable, tied to PNC stock performance  \n     and not payable until earned (if at      \n     all) for several years. Accordingly, at  \n     the beginning of the performance year,   \n  \u220e  the HR Committee establishes a specific  \n     minimum percentage of each NEO\u2019s total   \n     compensation that will be delivered      \n     through long-term equity-based awards.   \n     For the 2024 incentive compensation      \n     awards, the HR Committee established     \n     minimum equity percentages for each NEO  \n     ranging from 50% to 70%. The specific    \n     mix of cash and equity for each NEO is   \n     discussed in more detail in \u201c\u20142024       \n     incentive compensation decisions.\u201d       \n                                              \n                                              \n     We split the equity-based incentive      \n     between two forms of awards. Long-term   \n     equity-based incentive awards generally  \n     are granted in two primary forms, a      \n     Performance Share Unit (\u201cPSU\u201d)           \n     representing 60% of the value of the     \n  \u220e  long-term award, and a Restricted Share  \n     Unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) representing 40% of the     \n     value. Payouts under these awards are    \n     deferred over multiple years. For        \n     information on the terms of these        \n     awards, see \u201c\u2014Our compensation           \n     program\u2014Incentive compensation           \n     program.\u201d                                \n                                              \nEvaluating performance In the first quarter of\neach year, the HR Committee evaluates         \nperformance for the prior year to (1)         \ndetermine the prior year\u2019s total incentive    \ncompensation awards and (2) set the total     \ncompensation target for the current year. The \nHR Committee believes that an effective       \nexecutive compensation program requires a     \ncomprehensive evaluation of performance across\nmultiple categories. This evaluation generally\nincludes a review of financial performance,   \nhow we executed against our strategic         \nobjectives and how we manage risk, customer   \nexperience, talent management, financial      \naccountability and leadership. In determining \nthe amount of incentive awards against the    \nincentive compensation targets, the HR        \nCommittee may consider these performance      \nmetrics without assigning a specific weight or\nformula to any one metric. The HR Committee   \nhas not adopted a formula-driven compensation \nprogram, believing that formulas may reward   \nshort-term results or behaviors that do not   \nserve the long-term interests of our          \nshareholders. Metrics that rely solely on     \nformulas may also be inappropriately skewed by\nresults outside of management\u2019s control.      \nFinally, the HR Committee believes that       \nformulas may undervalue important strategic   \nobjectives that do not translate to easily or \nimmediately quantifiable metrics. As a result,\nthe HR Committee evaluates a variety of       \nquantitative and qualitative metrics to attain\na comprehensive understanding of PNC\u2019s overall\nperformance. To the extent possible, the      \nperformance metrics reviewed by the HR        \nCommittee align the objectives of our         \nmanagement, shareholders and bank regulatory  \nframework. In some cases, our stakeholders    \nhave different objectives that cannot be      \neasily reconciled; for example, shareholders  \nseeking higher returns may be willing to      \ntolerate more risk than a federal banking     \nregulator would accept. This is another reason\nthat we rely on multiple metrics, representing\nperformance against a range of goals, and     \ninclude the ability to make significant       \nadjustments for risk management performance.  \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             65  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS HR       \nCommittee evaluates performance quarterly.Our \nCEO reviews PNC\u2019s quarterly and annual        \nperformance with the HR Committee.

The HR Committee\nalso reviews the talent trends throughout our \nworkforce quarterly, including talent         \nrecruitment, development, retention and       \nemployee engagement trends. In addition, as   \npart of its Board-delegated duties, the HR    \nCommittee is responsible for regularly        \ndiscussing succession planning and overseeing \nand evaluating succession plans for PNC\u2019s     \nsenior executive management (other than the   \nChief Risk Officer, the General Auditor and   \ntheir direct reports, which are handled by the\nRisk and Audit Committees respectively).      \nSenior executives are accountable for         \nsuccession plans in their respective lines of \nbusiness and for supporting the development of\nall potential successors, and this is taken   \ninto consideration by the HR Committee in     \nevaluating performance.                       \n                                              \n  66    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Incentive\ncompensation program Determination of         \nincentive compensation levels.As described    \nabove, the incentive compensation target      \nawards include two components: (1) an annual  \nincentive award payable in cash and (2) a     \nlong-term incentive award that is equity-based\nand granted in two different forms (PSUs and  \nRSUs). Step 1:After the performance year ends,\nthe HR Committee evaluates PNC\u2019s aggregate    \nperformance for the year, as well as the      \nindividual performance of each NEO (with input\nfrom our CEO), and determines an incentive    \ncompensation amount to be awarded to each     \nexecutive, expressed as a percentage of the   \ntotal compensation target set at the beginning\nof the performance year. Step 2:Once the HR   \nCommittee determines the final incentive      \ncompensation amount, it is divided between the\nannual cash incentive and the long-term       \nequity-based incentive. The long-term         \nincentive award makes up at least 50% of the  \nvalue of the total compensation awarded to the\nNEO. Long-term incentive awards (equity-      \nbased).The long-term incentive is equity-based\nand granted in the form of PSUs and RSUs.     \nThese awards, and all other equity-based      \nawards, are granted by the HR Committee under \nPNC\u2019s shareholder-approved 2016 Incentive     \nAward Plan.

The payout is     \nbased on how PNC performs against two         \ncorporate performance metrics over a three-   \nyear performance period. Performance against  \nthese two metrics generates a percentage (the \ncorporate performance factor). The award may  \nbe decreased if PNC fails to satisfy a risk   \nperformance metric or based on a discretionary\nrisk performance review conducted by the HR   \nCommittee. After applying any risk-related    \nperformance adjustment (and if PNC satisfies  \nthe risk performance metric), the resulting   \npercentage is applied to the number of target \nPSUs to determine the final number of units   \navailable for settlement. The PSUs have a     \nmaximum payout opportunity of 150% of target. \nPayout of any award under the PSUs also       \nrequires the satisfaction of service          \nrequirements and other award conditions. Two  \ncorporate performance metrics.The two         \ncorporate performance metrics include an      \nabsolute metric (an internal PNC measurement  \nagainst a target) and a relative metric (PNC  \nperformance against our peer group). The      \nabsolute metric is PNC\u2019s three-year average   \nROE, as adjusted, compared to three-year ROE  \nperformance targets established in advance by \nthe HR Committee. The relative metric is PNC\u2019s\nthree-year average EPS growth, as adjusted,   \ncompared to the three-year average EPS growth \nof our peer group.                            \n                                              \n      Absolute metric \u2013 3-year average ROE    \n      (as adjusted). We adjust ROE for the    \n      items described in the paragraphs       \n      following the table below. The ROE      \n      metric, as adjusted, will be            \n      calculated annually for each year of    \n      the performance period.

In      \n      establishing the ROE performance        \n      targets, the HR Committee considers     \n      multiple factors, including our         \n      historical performance, budget and      \n      future growth expectations, peer group  \n      results, cost of capital and analyst    \n      expectations.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      Relative metric \u2013 3-year average EPS    \n      growth (as adjusted).

The HR Committee may increase or\ndecrease the size of the final payout to      \nmaintain the intended economics of the award  \nif circumstances change. These circumstances  \ninclude external events affecting PNC or      \nmembers of its peer group or its financial    \nstatements that are outside of PNC\u2019s control  \nand not reasonably anticipated. Further, in   \nevaluating the corporate performance metrics, \nafter applying the specific adjustments       \ndiscussed above, the HR Committee may also    \nconsider other unusual or nonrecurring        \nadjustments (applied on a consistent basis) in\ndetermining the final award payout percentage.\nRSUs.With respect to 2024 performance, in     \nearly 2025 the HR Committee also granted to   \nour NEOs (excluding Mr. Lyons), RSUs that     \nrepresent an opportunity to receive shares of \nPNC common stock. The RSUs vest pro rata over \nthree years, with each of the three annual    \ninstallments (tranches) vesting on the        \nanniversary of the grant date (or if later,   \nthe date the HR Committee determines that all \nrisk conditions have been satisfied).

The primary risk-based   \nmetric measured as part of this review is the \nBasel III CET1 ratio. At the end of the       \nperformance year, PNC\u2019s minimum required CET1 \nratio was 7.0%.                               \n                                              \n        Impact of risk-based performance      \n        metric under PSUs: For each year      \n        during the three-year performance     \n        period that PNC fails to meet the     \n        CET1 ratio, one-third of the target   \n        number of PSUs granted will be        \n  \u25fe    eligible for forfeiture. After the    \n        three-year performance period ends,   \n        the HR Committee will conduct a       \n        final performance review and may      \n        reduce the number of units available  \n        for payout if PNC did not meet the    \n        CET1 ratio for one or more years      \n        during the performance period.        \n                                              \n                                              \n        Impact of risk-based performance      \n        metric under RSUs: Each RSU tranche   \n        is subject to the same risk-related   \n        performance metric that will be       \n        applied to the PSUs. After the year   \n        ends, the HR Committee will conduct   \n        a risk-based performance review and   \n        may either cancel all shares or       \n        decrease the number of shares         \n        available for payout under the        \n        applicable RSU tranche if PNC did     \n        not meet the CET1 ratio as of the     \n        end of the most recent year before    \n  \u25fe    the vesting date of that tranche.     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nSubjective risk-based performance review.In   \naddition, and independent from the evaluation \nof the CET1 ratio, the HR Committee may       \nconduct another risk performance review for   \nthe PSUs and the RSUs. This discretionary     \nreview would generally occur in connection    \nwith a risk-related action of potentially     \nmaterial consequence to PNC. If the HR        \nCommittee exercises its discretion to conduct \na risk performance review, the HR Committee   \nwill review and determine if a reduction to   \nthe corporate performance factor for risk     \nperformance is appropriate for the PSUs or if \na reduction for risk performance is           \nappropriate for the applicable RSU tranche.   \nDividend equivalent payments.Both the PSUs and\nthe RSUs will accrue cash dividend equivalents\nduring their respective performance periods.  \nFor the PSUs, the accrued dividend equivalents\nwill be adjusted by the same percentage as the\ntarget PSUs at the time of payout and will    \nthen be paid out in cash. For the RSUs, the   \naccrued dividend equivalents with respect to a\ntranche will pay out in cash at the same time,\nand will be adjusted by the same payout       \npercentage, as the RSUs to which they relate. \nOther compensation and benefits In addition to\nthe components included in the total          \ncompensation target outlined above, our       \nexecutive compensation program also includes  \nlimited perquisites (to increase efficiency   \nand focus on our business), change of control \narrangements (for continuity of management in \nconnection with a potential change of control)\nand health and retirement plans (to promote   \nhealth and wellness and post-retirement       \nfinancial security).

Mr. Overstrom was not an NEO last year.\n2024 performance At meetings held during the  \nfirst quarter of 2025, the HR Committee       \nreviewed PNC\u2019s 2024 performance with the CEO, \nthe Chief Risk Officer and other members of   \nmanagement. In evaluating performance and     \ndetermining incentive compensation awards for \nour NEOs, the HR Committee may consider       \nseveral metrics, without assigning a          \nparticular weight to any one metric. To       \nevaluate PNC\u2019s 2024 performance, the HR       \nCommittee reviewed PNC\u2019s performance against  \nthe range of metrics described in \u201c\u2014Our       \ncompensation program\u2014Evaluating performance\u201d  \nsection of this CD&A, including the selected  \nperformance metrics as presented in the       \nfollowing table. To increase comparability of \nthese metrics across periods, the HR Committee\nalso considered the impact on some financial  \nperformance metrics (diluted EPS, ROE and     \nrisk-adjusted efficiency ratio) of the        \nadditional $112 million pre-taxFDIC special   \nassessment levied upon PNC in 2024 for the    \nrecovery of losses related to the closures of \nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank that   \noccurred in 2023. These considerations are    \nreflected in the metrics presented in the     \ntable below and are described in more detail  \nin the sections that follow.                  \n                                              \n  70    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \n                                              \n                                 20\u2026    2024  \n  Fi\u2026    2024    2024    2023    re\u2026    res\u2026  \n  pe\u2026    res\u2026    bud\u2026    res\u2026    vs.    vs.   \n  me\u2026                            20\u2026    2023  \n                                 bu\u2026    res\u2026  \n  Net                                         \n  in\u2026                                         \n  in\u2026    $13\u2026    $13\u2026    $13\u2026    +3\u2026    -3.\u2026  \n  (in                                         \n  mi\u2026                                         \n  No\u2026                                         \n  in\u2026    $8,\u2026    $7,\u2026    $7,\u2026    +1\u2026    +6.\u2026  \n  (in                                         \n  mi\u2026                                         \n  Di\u2026    $13\u2026    $12\u2026    $12\u2026    +7\u2026    +3.\u2026  \n  EP\u2026                                         \n  Di\u2026                                         \n  EPS                                         \n  (e\u2026    $13\u2026    $12\u2026    $13\u2026    +8\u2026    -2.\u2026  \n  FD\u2026                                         \n  sp\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  RO\u2026    10.\u2026    10.\u2026    11.\u2026    +7\u2026    -6.\u2026  \n  ROE                                         \n  (e\u2026                                         \n  FD\u2026    11.\u2026    10.\u2026    12.\u2026    +8\u2026    -11\u2026  \n  sp\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  RO\u2026    1.0\u2026    0.9\u2026    1.0\u2026    +6\u2026    0.0\u2026  \n  Ri\u2026                                         \n  ef\u2026    67.\u2026    68.\u2026    68.\u2026    +1\u2026    +1.\u2026  \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  Ri\u2026                                         \n  ef\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  (e\u2026    67.\u2026    68.\u2026    66.\u2026    +2\u2026    -1.\u2026  \n  FD\u2026                                         \n  sp\u2026                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026                                         \n  key    2024            2023                 \n  pe\u2026    res\u2026            res\u2026                 \n  me\u2026                                         \n  Net                                         \n  in\u2026    $5,\u2026            $5,\u2026                 \n  (in                                         \n  mi\u2026                                         \n  Ta\u2026                                         \n  bo\u2026                                         \n  va\u2026    $95\u2026            $85\u2026                 \n  per                                         \n  sh\u2026                                         \n  (n\u2026                                         \n  An\u2026                                         \n  to\u2026    29.\u2026            2.7%                 \n  sh\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  CE\u2026    10.\u2026            9.9%                 \n  ra\u2026                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     These metrics include HR                 \n     Committee-approved adjustments and are   \n  *  non-GAAP financial measures.

See Annex A for additional       \n       details on those ratios.               \n                                              \n                                              \n       The efficiency ratio is a measure of   \n       how effectively a company is           \n       utilizing the resources generated by   \n       operations during the year. A lower    \n       efficiency ratio is an indication      \n       that resources are being used more     \n  (2)  effectively, therefore we have         \n       presented decreases in the             \n       risk-adjusted efficiency ratio* and    \n       risk-adjusted efficiency ratio         \n       (excluding FDIC special assessment)*   \n       as a positive change and increases to  \n       the ratios as a negative change.       \n                                              \nIndividual performance reviews.In addition to \nevaluating our corporate performance based on \nthese financial and strategic metrics, the HR \nCommittee reviewed the individual performance \nof each NEO. The CEO discussed the individual \nperformance of the other NEOs with the HR     \nCommittee and, where appropriate, discussed   \nthe performance of the lines of business or   \nfunctions managed by the NEOs. The HR         \nCommittee approved compensation for each NEO  \nbased on an evaluation of corporate, business \nand individual performance. The HR Committee  \ndiscussed compensation recommendations for the\nCEO with Meridian, the HR Committee\u2019s         \nindependent compensation consultant for 2024, \nour Chief Human Resources Officer, our        \nExecutive Compensation Director and legal     \ncounsel. Other than the secretary for the     \nmeeting, no other members of management were  \npresent. Following this discussion, the HR    \nCommittee approved the compensation for our   \nCEO in an executive session. The HR Committee \nalso reviewed the CEO compensation decisions  \nin an executive session of the independent    \nmembers of the Board, with no members of      \nmanagement present. In that executive session,\nthe HR Committee allowed time for the         \nindependent directors to provide comments or  \nquestions about the CEO\u2019s performance or      \ncompensation. 2024 incentive compensation     \ndecisions Based on a comprehensive evaluation \nof PNC\u2019s 2024 performance, as described       \npreviously in the \u201c2024 performance overview\u201d \nand in the following sections, the HR         \nCommittee determined that it was appropriate  \nto award incentive compensation above the     \ntarget amount for all NEOs (excluding Mr.     \nLyons, who resigned prior to the date         \ndecisions were made). 2024 NEO incentive      \ncompensation awards.For each of our NEOs, the \ntable below compares the incentive            \ncompensation target to the actual incentive   \ncompensation awarded for the 2024 performance \nyear. The incentive compensation awarded for  \n2024 performance differs from what we disclose\nin the Summary compensation table in the      \nCompensation Tables section of this proxy     \nstatement. This is because SEC regulations    \nrequire PNC to include incentive awards from  \ntwo different performance years: the annual   \ncash incentive award based on 2024 performance\n(and paid in 2025) and the long-term equity-  \nbased incentive award based on 2023           \nperformance (and awarded in 2024). The long-  \nterm equity-based incentive award based on    \n2024 performance (and awarded in 2025) will be\nincluded in next year\u2019s Summary compensation  \ntable.                                        \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             71  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $           \n      $      $      $      $      $           \n      $      $      $      $      $           \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $           \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr.\u00a0Lyons resigned from PNC effective  \n  (1)  January\u00a023, 2025, and as a result,     \n       was not eligible to receive incentive  \n       compensation for 2024 performance.     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Under SEC regulations, the incentive   \n       compensation amounts disclosed in the  \n       Summary compensation table on page\u00a087  \n       include the annual cash incentive      \n       award paid in 2025 for 2024            \n       performance (the \u201cNon-Equity           \n       Incentive Plan Compensation\u201d column)   \n       and the long-term equity-based         \n  (2)  incentive award granted in 2024 for    \n       2023 performance (the \u201cStock Awards\u201d   \n       column). For Mr. Lyons, the amounts    \n       shown in the \u201cStock Awards\u201d column of  \n       the Summary compensation table differ  \n       slightly from the amounts shown in     \n       the table above due to the impact of   \n       rounding related to fractional         \n       shares.                                \n                                              \n2024 NEO pay mix.Consistent with our program, \nthe HR Committee decided to award 70% of the  \nCEO\u2019s overall pay mix in the form of long-term\nincentive compensation and 30% of his overall \npay mix in cash compensation. When applying   \nthis mix to the CEO\u2019s variable incentive      \ncompensation (i.e., excluding base salary),   \nthis same ratio translates to approximately   \n75% of the CEO\u2019s incentive compensation       \nawarded in the form of long-term incentive    \ncompensation and approximately 25% awarded in \nannual cash incentive compensation. For the   \nNEOs, the HR Committee decided to award 60% of\nMr. Reilly\u2019s and Mr. Parsley\u2019s overall pay mix\nin the form of long-term incentive            \ncompensation and 40% of their overall pay mix \nin cash compensation. For Ms. Guild and Mr.   \nOverstrom, the HR Committee decided to award  \n50% of their overall pay mix in the form of   \nlong-term incentive compensation and 50% of   \ntheir overall pay mix in cash compensation.   \nBecause Mr. Lyons resigned effective January  \n23, 2025, prior to the date that the HR       \nCommittee granted long-term and annual cash   \nincentive awards to the NEOs for 2024         \nperformance, Mr. Lyons was not eligible to    \nreceive any incentive compensation for his    \n2024 performance.

In making its decision, the   \n  HR                                          \n  Committee highlighted Mr. Demchak\u2019s proven  \n  ability                                     \n  to build long-term value for the benefit    \n  of all                                      \n  stakeholders, as reflected by PNC\u2019s         \n  continued                                   \n  premium P/E and P/B valuation relative to   \n  its                                         \n  peers. As a result, the HR Committee        \n  believes his                                \n  overall performance merits above-target     \n  incentive                                   \n  compensation. Delivering consistent         \n  financial                                   \n  value to PNC stakeholders. PNC              \n  outperformed budget                         \n  expectations across a number of financial   \n  metrics,                                    \n  generating record revenue of $21.6 billion  \n  in                                          \n  2024. The company reported net income of    \n  $6.0                                        \n  billion, or $13.74 diluted EPS, up 7% from  \n  2023,                                       \n  and tangible book value at year-end was     \n  $95.33 per                                  \n  common share, reflecting a 12% increase     \n  from the                                    \n  prior year. As a result, PNC ranked in the  \n  top                                         \n  quartile of its peer group in both diluted  \n  EPS and                                     \n  tangible book value growth. PNC delivered   \n  a                                           \n  one-year total                              \n                                              \nshareholder return of 29% and return on equity\n(ROE) of 11.32%. At the same time, Mr. Demchak\noversaw a disciplined approach to expense     \nmanagement, reducing noninterest expense      \n(excluding the impact of the FDIC assessment) \nby 1% from 2023 and achieving positive        \noperating leverage on a reported and adjusted \nbasis. In evaluating Mr. Demchak\u2019s            \nperformance, the HR Committee focused on his  \ndemonstrated long-term performance            \nconsistency, noting that:                     \n                                              \n        In 2024, PNC outperformed in diluted  \n        EPS, ranking 4th in its peer group,   \n        and ranked in the top quartile of     \n        its peers for both tangible book      \n        value growth as well as ROE, and      \n        achieved a one-year TSR that, while   \n        just below the peer median,           \n        delivered a 29% gross return to       \n        shareholders. The HR Committee also   \n        focused on PNC\u2019s consistent           \n        long-term performance, evidenced by   \n        the fact that PNC ranked second in    \n        its peer group at December\u00a031, 2024   \n        for both the forward P/E ratio and    \n  \u25fe    P/B ratio.                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n        The company\u2019s five-year TSR and       \n        10-year TSR continue to rank above    \n  \u25fe    the median, with a gross return to    \n        shareholders of 46% over 5 years and  \n        188% over 10 years.                   \n                                              \nThe HR Committee views these metrics as       \nillustrative of shareholder confidence in the \nability of Mr. Demchak to achieve PNC\u2019s       \nstrategic priorities and deliver consistent   \nfinancial value to PNC stakeholders.          \nEffectively positioning PNC for growth        \nopportunities. The HR Committee also focused  \non Mr. Demchak\u2019s performance in positioning   \nPNC to accelerate growth. In doing so, the HR \nCommittee considered the durability of PNC\u2019s  \nstrong levels of capital and liquidity and    \ncredit quality metrics, as reflected by:      \n                                              \n        A CET1 ratio of 10.5% at year-end     \n        2024, up from 9.9% as of December\u00a0    \n  \u25fe    31, 2023.                             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n        Tangible book value of $95.33 per     \n        common share, up 12% from year-end    \n  \u25fe    2023, reflecting organic growth in    \n        PNC\u2019s capital levels and an           \n        improvement in AOCI.                  \n                                              \nSustained momentum in executing strategic     \npriorities.The decision to award above-target \nincentive compensation also reflects the HR   \nCommittee\u2019s desire to sustain the momentum Mr.\nDemchak achieved in executing PNC\u2019s strategic \npriorities during 2024. To continue this      \nmomentum, the HR Committee took into account  \nMr. Demchak\u2019s commitment to and actions in    \ncreating a robust succession plan during 2024.\nDuring 2024, he successfully placed several   \nexecutives in new leadership roles and managed\nthe leadership team through executive         \ntransitions, and he continues to focus on     \nbuilding organizational depth.                \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             73  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS In       \nsummary, under Mr. Demchak\u2019s leadership, PNC  \ncontinues to deliver strong performance and   \nremains well positioned for growth, with      \nstrong revenue generation opportunities and   \nsolid capital levels and credit quality, led  \nby a strong management team. Based on these   \nconsiderations, the HR Committee determined it\nwas appropriate to grant Mr. Demchak total    \nincentive compensation of $23,700,000 for     \nperformance year 2024. 2024 NEO incentive     \ncompensation decisions As described above and \nin the following sections, the HR Committee   \ndetermined that it was appropriate to award   \nincentive compensation that was above the     \ntarget amount for each NEO (excluding Mr.     \nLyons) based on overall PNC performance and   \nindividual performance. In addition to the    \n2024 PNC performance considerations described \npreviously in the \u201c2024 performance overview\u201d,\nthe HR Committee also reviewed each NEO\u2019s     \nperformance with the CEO and considered       \nspecific individual achievements, as described\nin the paragraphs below. The sections below   \nset out the key achievements of each NEO      \nduring 2024. The charts below (and for the    \nCEO\u2019s pay above) show the base salary for 2024\nfor each executive and the annual cash and    \nlong-term equity-based incentives awarded in  \n2025 (for 2024 performance). The dark gray and\norange portions of each circle show the amount\nof total compensation that is at-riskand not  \nguaranteed.

PSUs. The PSUs\nvest based on performance over a three-year   \nperiod. At a meeting held on February 14,     \n2025, the HR Committee determined that the PSU\ngrants awarded to each NEO in 2022 had vested \n(other than for Mr. Lyons) and that the risk  \nperformance criteria had been satisfied. The  \nHR Committee approved a payout of 142.17% for \nthe 2022 PSU award for all eligible NEOs other\nthan Mr. Lyons. Mr. Overstrom did not receive \na PSU or RSU award in 2022. The 2022 PSU      \nawards have the same material terms and       \nconditions as the 2023 and 2024 PSUs. The HR  \nCommittee reviews PNC\u2019s ROE and EPS growth for\neach year of the three-year performance       \nperiod. Under the terms of the 2022 PSU       \nawards, we adjust these two metrics, as       \nappropriate, for certain items, including     \ndiscontinued operations (under GAAP),         \nacquisition costs and merger integration      \ncosts, changes in U.S. federal tax law, and   \nthe net impact on PNC related to the sale of  \nits former equity stake in BlackRock in 2020. \nSince the BlackRock-related impact phased out \nin 2021, no adjustments were made to the 2022 \nPSU award relating to the sale of PNC\u2019s equity\nstake in BlackRock.                           \n                                              \n  76    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Once the \nthree-year performance period ends, we take   \nthe average of each metric over the           \nperformance period to determine an overall    \ncorporate performance factor.

In addition, the HR Committee may \nreduce or increase the payout under the award \nto maintain the intended economics of the     \naward in light of changed                     \ncircumstances\u2014meaning external events         \naffecting PNC, its financial statements or    \nmembers of its peer group that are            \nsubstantially outside of PNC\u2019s control and    \ncould not reasonably be planned for as of the \ngrant date. Consistent with adjustments made  \nto the 2021 PSUs (as disclosed in last year\u2019s \nCD&A), the HR Committee considered the impact \nof a special assessment by the FDIC following \nthe bank failures that occurred in March 2023.\nFollowing these bank failures, the FDIC       \ninvoked the systemic risk exception to support\nuninsured depositors of the failed            \ninstitutions, an event outside of PNC\u2019s       \ncontrol. To recover losses to the Deposit     \nInsurance Fund, the FDIC levied a special     \nassessment to be collected from PNC and other \nbank holding companies, including all of PNC\u2019s\npeers. When considering the payout for the    \n2022 PSU awards, the HR Committee discussed   \nthe significant impact to expenses of the $515\nmillion pre-taxFDIC special assessment in 2023\nand the additional $112 million pre-tax \u201ctrue-\nup\u201dspecial assessment in 2024. In calculating \nROE and EPS growth, the HR Committee adjusted \nexpenses to remove this unusual and           \nnonrecurring expense for both PNC and PNC\u2019s   \npeers. The FDIC special assessment adjustment \nresulted in a final payout percentage of      \n142.17%. Without this adjustment, the         \nformulaic final payout percentage for the 2022\nPSUs was 139.42%. Compensation policies and   \npractices The HR Committee adopts policies and\nprocedures to assist in the fulfillment of its\nduties, and we describe some of the           \nsignificant policies and procedures in this   \nsection. In addition to formal policies and   \nprocedures, the HR Committee has several      \npractices that it follows in the fulfillment  \nof its duties and responsibilities. Some of   \nthose practices are described below.          \nCompensation and risk The HR Committee        \nevaluates the risks inherent in the incentive \ncompensation program. For a detailed          \ndiscussion of how the HR Committee evaluates  \nrisk, see \u201cCompensation and Risk\u201d in this     \nproxy statement. Independent compensation     \nconsultant The HR Committee retains Meridian  \nCompensation Partners, LLC as its independent \ncompensation consultant. For a discussion of  \nthis relationship and the considerations the  \nHR Committee takes into account when          \ndetermining independence, see the discussion  \nunder the heading \u201cManaging with              \nintegrity\u2014Compensation decisions\u2014Roles of     \nexecutive officers and consultants.\u201d          \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             77  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Peer     \ngroup The HR Committee selects a peer group   \neach year. We use this group to help measure  \nrelative performance and to determine payouts \nunder our long-term incentive awards. We also \nuse this group for general compensation       \ncomparisons. In approving a peer group, the HR\nCommittee analyzes several factors, including \nthe mix and complexity of businesses, the     \nmarkets being served, market capitalization,  \nasset size and changes resulting from mergers \nor shifts in strategic direction. We also look\nat the companies with whom we generally       \ncompete for talent. We use the same peer group\nfor both performance and compensation         \ncomparisons. Each year, the HR Committee      \nreviews the composition of the peer group with\nmanagement and its independent compensation   \nconsultant. For 2024, the HR Committee        \nbelieved that the existing peer group         \ngenerally provided a balanced mix of          \ninstitutions considering our size, mix and    \nscope of businesses, products and services,   \nand sources of executive talent. The peer     \ngroup currently includes the following 11     \ncompanies, with assets and market             \ncapitalization for PNC and our peer group     \nmeasured as of December 31, 2024, and revenue \nfor PNC and our peer group measured for the   \nfull year:                                    \n                                              \n                   \u2026            \u2026             \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026             \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026       \u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n           \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n                                              \nAfter a review by the HR Committee, the peer  \ngroup for 2025 remained unchanged from 2024.  \nGiven the increasing competition for banking  \ntalent both among our peers and in the broader\nfinancial industry, the HR Committee also     \nreviewed and considered survey data provided  \nby Aon\u2019s Radford McLagan Compensation Database\n(\u201cMcLagan\u201d) in addition to the compensation   \ndata of our peer group. Specifically, the     \nMcLagan survey data consisted of total        \ncompensation (including 2023 base salary, 2023\ncash bonus, and long-term incentive awards for\nthe 2023 performance year) information of     \nsimilarly-positioned senior executives at the \nfollowing financial institutions not included \nin PNC\u2019s peer group: Ally Financial Inc.,     \nAmerican Express Company, The Bank of New York\nMellon Corporation, Citigroup Inc., The       \nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Morgan Stanley,    \nNorthern Trust Corporation, and State Street  \nCorporation. These institutions are peers of  \nPNC\u2019s peer group members, other than Northern \nTrust Corporation. The HR Committee primarily \nused the McLagan survey data as a reference   \npoint to better understand compensation       \npractices within the financial services       \nindustry. Executive stock ownership and       \nretention requirements Our NEOs historically  \nhave held a significant portion of their      \nassets in the form of our common stock (or    \nother equity-based instruments that reflect   \nthe performance of our common stock). The HR  \nCommittee believes it is important to require \nour NEOs to meet minimum stock ownership      \nguidelines, denominated in PNC shares. Each   \nNEO must meet additional ownership            \nrequirements, even after meeting the original \nownership target. The ownership requirements  \nincrease the number of PNC shares that an     \nindividual must own over time with an ongoing \nretention requirement. This retention         \nrequirement provides that as new equity awards\nvest, designated executives must retain a     \npercentage of the stock, which they must      \ngenerally hold until they retire or leave PNC.\nThis ownership policy reflects compensation   \nawards over the NEO\u2019s career and ties the     \nNEO\u2019s personal wealth closely to the long-term\nperformance of PNC and the interests of our   \nshareholders.                                 \n                                              \n  78    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Equity   \ninterests that count toward satisfaction of   \nthe ownership guidelines include:             \n                                              \n      Shares owned outright by the officer,   \n  1.  or his or her spouse and dependent      \n      children;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  2.

Under the\npolicy, the HR Committee considers the        \ncircumstances of an executive\u2019s failure to    \ncomply with the policy when making            \ncompensation decisions for that executive. At \nthe time of the compensation decisions, the HR\nCommittee determined that all of our NEOs     \ncomplied with the policy. Clawback and        \nforfeiture Dodd-Frank Recoupment Policy.The HR\nCommittee previously adopted the Dodd-Frank   \nRecoupment Policy as required by the final    \nrules under the Dodd-Frank Act and NYSE       \nlisting standards. The Dodd-Frank Recoupment  \nPolicy requires us to recoup any excess       \nincentive compensation paid to current or     \nformer executive officers based on financial  \nstatements that were required to be restated  \ndue to material noncompliance with financial  \nreporting requirements, without regard to any \nfault or misconduct. The Dodd-Frank Recoupment\nPolicy is a standalone clawback policy that   \nexists in addition to our Incentive           \nCompensation Adjustment and Clawback Policy   \n(\u201cPNC Clawback Policy\u201d), which is described in\ndetail below.                                 \n                                              \n      In the event of a triggering event      \n      under the Dodd-Frank Recoupment         \n  1.  Policy, the HR Committee will first     \n      apply the terms of the Dodd-Frank       \n      Recoupment Policy.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n      Following application of that policy,   \n      to the extent any adjustment or         \n      clawback under the PNC Clawback Policy  \n  2.  should additionally be applied, the HR  \n      Committee will then apply the PNC       \n      Clawback Policy to any covered          \n      incentive compensation.                 \n                                              \nPNC Clawback Policy.Since 2013, PNC has       \nmaintained a formal \u201cclawback\u201d policy that    \napplies to our NEOs and other executive       \nofficers, as well as other senior executives  \nand those employees receiving equity-based    \ncompensation. The HR Committee reviews and    \nupdates this clawback and incentive adjustment\npolicy on a regular basis. A summary of the   \nPNC Clawback Policy is provided in the chart  \nand paragraphs below. Clawback for inaccurate \nmetrics.For purposes of the clawback for      \nmaterially inaccurate performance metrics,    \nperformance metrics include any metric,       \nincluding corporate financial results, used   \ndirectly or indirectly to determine whether   \nincentive compensation is to be provided to an\nexecutive (or group of executives) or to      \ndetermine the amount of any such compensation.\nThe portion of the incentive compensation     \n(which includes both equity-based and cash    \nincentive compensation) that represents the   \nexcess over what would have been provided if  \nthere had been no material inaccuracy in the  \nperformance metric will be subject to         \nclawback. The HR Committee retains discretion,\nto the extent legally permissible, to         \ndetermine that it would not be in PNC\u2019s best  \ninterests to seek to enforce the clawback.    \nThis clawback for materially inaccurate       \nperformance metrics will not apply to any     \nincentive compensation that has previously    \nbeen subject to a recoupment obligation under \nthe Dodd-Frank Recoupment Policy.             \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             79  \n  Proxy Statement

employees who took \nrisk-related actions (or failed to act) and   \ntheir supervisors. Examples of adverse risk-  \nrelated impacts.The types of adverse impacts  \ncould include matters such as impacts to the  \nfinancial performance, capital or liquidity   \npositions, reputation operations (including   \ncompliance, business continuity, technology   \nand information security) or business         \nprospects of PNC or a business segment or     \ncorporate function within PNC. The negative   \nadjustment resulting from risk-related actions\nallows PNC to recoup unvested equity awards   \nfrom recipients whose inappropriate risk-     \ntaking activities have resulted in, or are    \nexpected to result in, a material adverse     \nimpact to PNC in the future. By doing so, we  \ncan further balance the risks in our incentive\narrangements by accounting for both forward-  \nand backward-looking risk adjustments.        \n                                              \n  80    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \nDisclosure of clawback of adjustment actions  \nunder PNC Clawback Policy.The policy provides \nthat if PNC applies the PNC Clawback Policy to\nrecoup or clawback incentive compensation or  \nnegatively adjust incentive compensation as a \nresult of risk-related actions and the        \nunderlying factual circumstances are otherwise\npublicly reported by PNC in a filing with the \nSEC or in disclosure that would otherwise meet\nthe requirements for public disclosure by PNC \nunder the SEC\u2019s Regulation FD, or are         \ndisclosed by a third party in a publicly      \navailable court or administrative filing, then\nPNC will disclose in the proxy statement for  \nits annual shareholder meeting, a current     \nreport on Form 8-Kor other public filing made \nby it with the SEC or a posting in a clearly  \nidentifiable location in the Investor         \nRelations section of its corporate website:   \n                                              \n        a general description of the          \n        circumstances giving rise to the      \n        incentive compensation recovery or    \n  \u25fe    adjustment, including items such as   \n        the number of employees, seniority    \n        of employees and line of business     \n        impacted; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25fe    the aggregate amount of incentive     \n        compensation recovered or adjusted.   \n                                              \nPNC may limit such disclosure if it would be  \nlikely to result in, or exacerbate, any       \nexisting or threatened employee, shareholder  \nor other litigation, arbitration or proceeding\nagainst PNC. Adjustments following termination\nof employment.Adjustments following           \ntermination of employment. In circumstances   \nwhere the PNC Clawback Policy requires or     \npermits an adjustment, PNC may pursue the     \nadjustments against affected covered employees\nafter termination of their employment with PNC\nfor any reason. Approval of severance         \nagreements We have a Board-approved policy    \nregarding shareholder approval of future      \nseverance arrangements. Under this policy, PNC\nwill not enter into an arrangement with an    \nexecutive officer that provides for additional\nseverance benefits in an amount exceeding 2.99\ntimes the sum of the executive officer\u2019s      \nannual base salary and target bonus for the   \nyear of termination, unless the future        \nseverance arrangement is approved by the      \naffirmative vote of a majority of votes cast  \nby shareholders on the matter. The Board      \nretains the right to amend, terminate or waive\nthe policy and will promptly disclose any such\nchange. We have made this policy available in \nthe Governance Documents section of           \nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance.

Limiting \nperquisites Overview.The HR Committee believes\nin limiting the number and value of           \nperquisites provided to our NEOs. We consider \na benefit to be a perquisite or personal      \nbenefit unless its purpose is clearly and     \nexclusively business-related. We determine the\nvalue of perquisites based on their           \nincremental cost to us. The principal         \nperquisites we may provide to our NEOs include\nfinancial consulting and tax preparation      \nservices and limited personal use of corporate\naircraft (as discussed in greater detail      \nbelow). Two NEOs also remain eligible to      \nreceive executive physicals under a legacy    \nprogram that we no longer offer. The          \nperquisites we provide to our NEOs under the  \nprogram do not include any tax \u201cgross ups.\u201d   \nSecurity.In addition to the foregoing         \nperquisites, PNC provides physical security   \nservices to Mr. Demchak as a result of        \nrepeated, verified incidents threatening his  \npersonal safety. PNC may also provide physical\nsecurity services in response to verified     \nthreats to other NEOs from time to time. PNC  \ndetermined it was in the Company\u2019s business   \ninterest to provide certain security measures \nto ensure the safety and security of our key  \npersonnel. While we view these security       \nservices as necessary and appropriate business\nexpenses, we have reported the incremental    \ncosts of these services to the Company in the \n\u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column in the Summary\ncompensation table because these measures may \nbe deemed as conveying a personal benefit to  \nMr. Demchak or the other NEOs. Aircraft       \nusage.All currently employed NEOs (other than \nour CEO), receive a $10,000 allowance for     \npersonal aircraft usage. As the HR Committee  \nhas previously recommended that our CEO take  \nall flights (personal or business) on the     \ncorporate aircraft, the HR Committee has      \napproved an allowance not to exceed $100,000  \nfor personal flights taken on the corporate   \naircraft by our CEO. The cost of any personal \nflights taken on the corporate aircraft that  \nexceeds the applicable allowance are          \nreimbursed by the NEO pursuant to the terms of\na time-sharing agreement between the NEO and  \nPNC.                                          \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             81  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Due to   \ncertain operational restrictions and          \nadministrative efficiencies, we operate our   \ncorporate aircraft under Federal Aviation     \nAdministration rules and regulations that     \nlimit our ability to accept reimbursement for \npersonal aircraft usage unless an individual  \nhas a time-sharing agreement. The time-sharing\nagreement provides a mechanism to obtain      \nreimbursement from the NEO. The costs paid by \nan NEO under the terms of the agreement       \ninclude incremental costs, as well as a       \nfederal excise tax and other fees. For flights\nsubject to a time-sharing agreement, the NEO  \nis required to pay us for the following costs:\n                                              \n  \u25fe    fuel, oil, lubricants and other       \n        additives;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n        travel expenses of crew, including    \n  \u25fe    food, lodging and ground              \n        transportation;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25fe    hangar and tie-down costs away from   \n        the aircraft\u2019s base of operation;     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25fe    insurance obtained for the specific   \n        flight;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25fe    landing fees, airport taxes and       \n        similar assessments;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25fe    custom, foreign permit and similar    \n        fees directly related to the flight;  \n                                              \n                                           \n  \u25fe    in-flight food and beverages; and  \n                                           \n                                          \n  \u25fe    passenger ground transportation.  \n                                          \nThe HR Committee has adopted an aviation      \npolicy and written procedures to document the \nprinciples to be applied in determining the   \nclassification of a flight as business or     \npersonal and the calculation of aggregate     \nincremental costs for perquisite purposes,    \nincluding definitions of personal use,        \nenhanced methods for allocating costs between \nbusiness and personal use in complex          \nsituations and an approach for capturing      \ndeadhead flights, where appropriate, in the   \ncalculation of incremental costs for personal \nuse of the corporate aircraft. Guidelines on  \nthe use of discretion The HR Committee has    \nadopted guidelines on using discretion in     \nincentive compensation plans. Under these     \nguidelines, the use of discretion will be     \nexercised, when permitted under a plan, so    \nthat incentive compensation awards are        \nreasonably aligned with risk-adjusted         \nperformance. Certain plans have discretionary \nand formulaic components, while other plans   \nare fully discretionary. For plans with both  \ndiscretionary and formulaic components, the   \nguidance provides, among other things, that a \ndiscretionary increase in otherwise           \nformulaically determined incentive            \ncompensation should be based on behaviors,    \nactions or results that are deemed to be      \nextraordinary, exceed expectations or provide \nsignificant direct or indirect benefits to PNC\nor our businesses. At the same time, a        \ndiscretionary reduction in compensation should\nbe based on behaviors, actions or results that\nfail to meet expectations or negatively impact\nour performance, reputation or work           \nenvironment. The guidelines specifically      \naddress the need to evaluate both risk-taking \nbehaviors during the performance year, as well\nas the outcome of prior risk-taking behaviors,\nwhen making discretionary incentive           \ncompensation decisions. Consideration of tax  \ndeductibility Section 162(m) of the Internal  \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) \ndoes not generally allow a company to deduct  \ncompensation over $1 million paid to certain  \nexecutive officers. Although the HR Committee \nconsiders the deductibility of expenses when  \nit makes compensation decisions, the HR       \nCommittee believes in maintaining the         \nflexibility and competitive effectiveness of  \nthe executive compensation program. The HR    \nCommittee retains the discretion to establish \nthe compensation paid to the NEOs as the HR   \nCommittee determines to be in the best        \ninterests of PNC and its shareholders, and    \nwithout regard to any limitation provided in  \nSection 162(m). Tax deductibility, while an   \nimportant consideration, is analyzed as one   \ncomponent of the overall program.             \n                                              \n  82    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092025 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Glossary \nof performance metrics This glossary describes\nsome of the performance metrics that the HR   \nCommittee may use to evaluate performance and \nmake compensation decisions.                  \n                                              \n                               Bank           \n                               regulators     \n                               have           \n                               established    \n                               risk-based     \n                               and leverage   \n                               capital        \n                               ratios to      \n                               evaluate our   \n                               capital        \n                               adequacy and   \n                               financial      \n                               strength.

We strive to ensure that our         \nperformance management and compensation       \narrangements for all employees are balanced in\nways that do not create incentives for        \nimprudent or excessive risk-taking, are       \ndesigned to provide a superior customer       \nexperience, and are reflective of our business\nmodel, management structure and risk appetite.\nOur compensation program for executives and   \nother senior employees is designed to         \nencourage management of risk according to our \nrisk appetite and discourage inappropriate    \nrisk taking through a diverse portfolio of    \nincentive compensation awards that is intended\nto reward desired behavior over time.         \nSpecifically, we balance our portfolio of     \nawards between fixed and variable             \ncompensation; cash and equity-based           \ncompensation; and annual and long-term        \ncompensation. Award determinations are based  \non the HR Committee\u2019s assessment of a variety \nof quantitative and qualitative performance   \nmeasurements, on both an absolute and a       \nrelative basis. We also permit the exercise of\ndiscretion in compensation decisions to       \nconsider other factors, such as effective risk\nmanagement, delivering a superior customer    \nexperience, compliance with controls and      \nethical duties, commitment to fostering       \ninclusion and developing the best talent,     \ncompetition for top talent, market-based pay  \nlevels and the need to attract and engage our \nleaders. As discussed in the CD&A, grants to  \nNEOs and certain other executives under our   \nlong-term incentive program include a risk-   \nbased performance metric. Payouts under those \ngrants could be forfeited if we do not meet   \nthe CET1 ratio described in \u201cCompensation     \nDiscussion and Analysis\u2014Our compensation      \nprogram\u2014Incentive compensation program\u201d in    \nthis proxy statement. We also have a broad-   \nbased clawback and incentive compensation     \nadjustment policy as described in             \n\u201cCompensation Discussion and                  \nAnalysis\u2014Compensation policies and            \npractices\u2014Clawback and forfeiture\u201d in this    \nproxy statement. We maintain an equity        \ncompensation program for approximately        \n155senior leaders below the executive level   \nthat is designed to ensure their incentive    \ncompensation awards reflect risk-adjusted     \nperformance outcomes and pay out, if at all,  \nover a three-year period. These senior leaders\nreceive a portion of their incentive          \ncompensation in an equity-based award that is \nsubject to the same risk-related performance  \nmetric that is applied to the PSU and RSU     \ngrants made to NEOs and certain other         \nexecutives. Equity award agreements for all   \nsenior leaders contain an enterprise-wide     \nrisk-based review trigger. For senior leaders \nin the lines of business (as opposed to those \nin administrative or control functions),      \nequity award agreements contain an additional,\nbusiness-specific risk-based review trigger.  \nIf a risk-based review is triggered, the      \napplicable review committee will determine    \nwhether a downward adjustment is warranted, up\nto a complete cancellation of the share units \nin that year\u2019s tranche. All employees have    \nperformance goals tied to business and        \nindividual performance, but each employee, no \nmatter their role at PNC, also has customer   \nfocus and risk management goals. We evaluate  \nemployee performance against these goals, in  \naddition to considering risk outcomes from    \nactions taken in prior years. We incorporate  \nthis comprehensive evaluation of employee risk\nmanagement into our performance and incentive \ncompensation decisions. In addition, all      \nemployees are encouraged to collaborate across\ngroups to identify and mitigate risks and     \nelevate and address identified issues or      \nconcerns.                                     \n                                              \n  Enterprise risk appetite statement          \n  We dynamically manage our risk appetite to  \n  optimize long-term shareholder value while  \n  supporting our employees, customers, and    \n  communities.

The    \nChief Risk Officer also presents the HR       \nCommittee with a risk assessment of each of   \nour principal business units and a collective \nrisk assessment of staff functions, including \nfinance, human resources, legal, operations   \nand technology. In addition, we maintain at   \nleast one director who is a member of both the\nHR Committee and the Risk Committee. At       \npresent, PNC\u2019s Presiding Director, Andrew T.  \nFeldstein, is a member of both the Risk       \nCommittee and the HR Committee. We also have  \nsystematically identified individuals who     \ncould potentially expose us to material       \namounts of risk or financial loss. As with our\nincentive compensation risk assessment        \ndescribed below, we have established a cross- \nfunctional team that continues to identify and\nmonitor these individuals. These individuals  \nare subject to a supplemental risk management \nreview as part of the performance management  \nprocess by the Chief Risk Officer and his     \ndesignees; we take this review into account   \nwhen determining incentive compensation awards\nfor our most senior executives. We have       \ndeveloped a standardized governance framework \nfor our incentive compensation plans to help  \nmonitor and validate that our plans balance   \nrisk and reward, comply with applicable laws  \nand regulations, demonstrate fiscal           \nresponsibility and maintain an appropriate    \ncustomer focus. This framework helps to ensure\nthat we have the appropriate procedures,      \ncontrols and independent challenges in place  \nto do so. We continue to assess and, where    \nappropriate, modify our incentive compensation\nplans in accordance with this framework to    \nhelp ensure our plans appropriately reflect   \nrisk considerations, including the management \nof identified issues, the duration of the     \nrisks and alignment with our desired risk     \nappetite. Examples of incentive plan          \nmodifications include:                        \n                                              \n        Adding or increasing the visibility   \n        of risk and customer focus metrics    \n  \u25fe    to plans based on the structure of    \n        the plan and the nature of the        \n        business and the roles of             \n        participants                          \n                                              \n                                              \n        Adding or formalizing language        \n        around delaying award payments or     \n  \u25fe    recapture or reduction of payments    \n        where subsequent risk metrics         \n        indicate excessive risk-taking        \n                                              \n                                              \n        Enhancing documentation of the plan   \n        design and use of discretion          \n  \u25fe    innon-formulaicplans at the pool      \n        funding, business allocation or       \n        individual award level                \n                                              \nBased on our approach to risk management, our \ncomprehensive incentive plan governance       \nframework, our risk assessments of significant\nbusinesses and staff functions, and the       \ninclusion of risk-based metrics in our long-  \nterm incentive compensation programs, we      \nbelieve that the risks arising from our       \ncompensation plans, policies a ndpractices are\nnot reasonably likely to have a material      \nadverse effect on PNC. Equity grant timing    \nPolicies and practices related to the grant of\ncertain equity awards close in time to the    \nrelease of material nonpublic information     \n(MNPI).While we do not currently grant new    \nawards of stock options, stock appreciation   \nrights (\u201cSARs\u201d), or similar option-like       \ninstruments, the HR Committee maintains and   \nadheres to a written procedure (the \u201cGrant    \nProcedure\u201d) that provides, among other things,\nthat the grant date for any option or SAR will\nbe the first date to occur following the HR   \nCommittee\u2019s grant decision regarding the      \noption or SAR that is either: (i) the second  \nbusiness day after the public announcement of \nquarterly (including year-end)earnings by PNC;\nor (ii) the date of the meeting of the HR     \nCommittee at which the HR Committee\u2019s         \nexecutive compensation decisions for the prior\nperformance year are approved. Additionally,  \nour Grant Procedure provides that the grant   \ndate for equity awards (other than options and\nSARs) to executives will be the date that the \nHR Committee makes the grant decision, or such\nother date thereafter as determined and       \napproved by the HR Committee. The Grant       \nProcedure also provides that, to the extent   \npracticable, annual equity grants (other than \noptions and SARs) to executives should have   \nthe same grant date. As a result, the HR      \nCommittee has historically granted such awards\non a pre-determinedannual schedule. While our \nGrant Procedure is designed to encourage      \nconsistency in practice, it is not intended to\nand does not limit the authority of the HR    \nCommittee under our equity incentive plans,   \nincluding the 2016 Incentive Award Plan.      \n                                              \n  86    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-2025 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation tables Summary compensation table\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n*Ms. Guild was not an NEO in 2022. **Mr.      \nOverstrom was not an NEO in 2023 or 2022.     \n***Mr. Lyons resigned from PNC and his        \nposition as President effective January 23,   \n2025.                                         \n                                              \n       This column includes any salary        \n       amounts deferred by an NEO under       \n       qualified (ISP) or non-qualified       \n       (DCIP) benefit plans.

The incremental cost  \n     of Mr.\u00a0Demchak\u2019s use of the aircraft in  \n     2024 was $100,000.

The   \n     incremental cost to PNC of personal      \n     aircraft use is calculated by            \n     multiplying the total number of          \n     personal flight hours by the average     \n     direct variable operating costs          \n     (including costs related to fuel,        \n     maintenance expenses related to          \n     operation of the plane during the year,  \n     and landing and parking fees) per        \n  *  flight hour for the particular aircraft  \n     for the year, plus crew expenses         \n     attributable to the personal use. Since  \n     the aircraft are used primarily for      \n     business travel, we do not include in    \n     the calculation the fixed costs that do  \n     not change based on usage, such as crew  \n     salaries and other maintenance and       \n     inspection and capital improvement       \n     costs intended to cover a multiple-year  \n     period.

Cash balance pension plan.We       \nmaintain a pension plan for most of our full- \ntime employees. The pension plan is a defined \nbenefit cash balance pension plan under the   \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of    \n1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and is intended to\nbe qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.\nEach calendar quarter, eligible participants  \nreceive \u201cearnings credits\u201d based on a         \npercentage of eligible compensation. Earnings \ncredit percentages for employees who were plan\nparticipants on December 31, 2009 are based on\na schedule using the participant\u2019s age and    \nyears of credited service at that date and are\nfrozen at that level. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who become participants on or after \nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible     \ncompensation. The plan defines eligible       \n\u201ccompensation\u201d as regular earnings plus       \neligible variable compensation, such as paid  \nannual incentives. Eligible \u201ccompensation\u201d    \ndoes not include deferrals under the terms of \nthe non-qualifieddeferred compensation and    \nincentive plan; these are instead taken into  \naccount under our excess pension plan         \ndescribed below. We generally limit eligible  \nvariable compensation for a plan year to a    \ntotal of 100% of the first $25,000 plus 50% of\nthe next $225,000. For participants who had   \naccrued benefits prior to 1999 under the      \npension plan formula then in effect, an       \ninitial cash balance \u201caccount\u201d was established\nbased on the present value of the accrued     \nbenefits at the time of the conversion to the \ncurrent program. Plan participants generally  \nreceive quarterly \u201cinterest credits\u201d at a rate\nof one-fourthof the annual interest rate on   \n30-yearTreasury securities. Employees who were\nalready plan participants as of December 31,  \n2009 receive a minimum interest credit. We    \ncontribute to the plan an actuarially         \ndetermined amount necessary to fund the total \nbenefits payable to participants. Actuaries   \ncalculate total contributions instead of      \ncontributions for each individual participant.\nExcess pension plan.We maintain an ERISA      \nexcess pension plan, which is a supplemental  \nnon-qualifiedpension plan. The excess benefits\nunder this plan equal the difference, if any, \nbetween a participant\u2019s benefit under the     \nqualified pension plan computed without regard\nto applicable Code limits and taking into     \naccount amounts deferred under the non-       \nqualifieddeferred compensation and incentive  \nplan, and the participant\u2019s actual benefit    \nunder the qualified pension plan. Supplemental\nexecutive retirement plan.We maintain a       \nsupplemental executive retirement plan for    \ncertain executive officers. As part of its    \nongoing review of compensation practices, the \nPersonnel and Compensation Committee (now     \nknown as the HR Committee) decided in 2007 to \neliminate future plan participation for new   \nexecutive officers. This plan provides        \nearnings credits based on a percentage of     \nannual incentives awarded under eligible      \nexecutive bonus plans in accordance with a    \nschedule based on the participant\u2019s age and   \nyears of credited service. This plan also     \nprovides quarterly interest credits that      \nmirror the interest credits under the         \nqualified pension plan. Executive officers who\nparticipated in the supplemental executive    \nretirement plan on December 31, 1998 and who  \nwere at least age 50 with five or more years  \nof credited service receive grandfathered     \nbenefits based on the pension formula in      \neffect prior to 1999.

Prior to establishing the DCIP \nin 2012, we offered a non-                    \nqualifiedsupplemental incentive savings plan  \n(\u201cSISP\u201d), which was a supplement to the ISP,  \nand a non-qualifieddeferred compensation plan \n(\u201cDCP\u201d), in each case for certain designated  \nemployees who exceeded applicable compensation\nthresholds. Incentive savings plan (ISP).The  \nISP is a defined contribution 401(k) plan that\nis intended to be qualified under Section     \n401(a) of the Code. During 2024, participants \ncould elect to contribute between 1% and 75%  \nof eligible compensation to the plan each year\nas pre-taxor Roth after-taxelective deferrals \n(or a combination of pre-taxand Roth after-   \ntaxelective deferrals), subject to Code       \nlimits. Participants who are age 50 or older  \nmay contribute additional pre-taxamounts      \ncalled \u201ccatch-upcontributions\u201d each year. For \n2024, we made employer matching contributions \non behalf of eligible participants equal to   \n100% of elective deferrals up to 4% of        \neligible compensation. Matching contributions \nwere made in cash. Participants direct the    \ninvestment of their accounts among the        \ninvestment options offered under the plan, and\ntheir account balances are adjusted for gains \nor losses resulting from those investment     \ndirections. Deferred compensation and         \nincentive plan (DCIP).We maintain a DCIP for  \ndesignated employees who exceed a compensation\nthreshold. Participants can elect to defer up \nto 20% of base salary and/or up to 75% of     \neligible short-term incentive pay earned with \nrespect to a plan year.

The HR Committee\nhas discretion to provide severance benefits  \nsubject to the parameters of our Board-       \napproved policy, as described in \u201cCompensation\nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d in this proxy        \nstatement. The benefits an executive may      \nreceive will depend on whether PNC or the     \nexecutive terminated employment and, if PNC   \nterminated employment, whether the termination\nwas for cause, resulted from death or         \ndisability, or followed a change in control,  \nand whether the executive is retirement-      \neligible. If a retirement-eligible employee   \nresigns or is terminated without cause, we    \nconsider it a retirement. For these purposes, \na \u201cretirement-eligible\u201d employee is someone   \nwho is at least 55 years old and has at least \nfive years of service with PNC. As of December\n31, 2024, Messrs. Demchak, Reilly and Parsley \nand Ms. Guild were retirement-eligible. The   \nfollowing sections provide a summary of       \narrangements in effect as of December 31, 2024\nthat would provide for payments to an NEO in  \nconnection with termination of the NEO\u2019s      \nemployment. Change of control agreements As of\nDecember 31, 2024, we have entered into       \nseparate change of control agreements with    \neach of our NEOs and similar agreements with a\nlimited group of other senior officers. These \nagreements have been a valuable component of  \nour executive compensation program for several\nyears. We believe these arrangements mitigate \nconcerns arising from a change of control, and\nhelp to ensure the continued dedicated service\nof our key employees. Cash payments           \ncontemplated by these agreements require a    \n\u201cdouble trigger\u201d \u2014 that is, the occurrence of \nboth a change of control and a qualifying     \ntermination of employment. A qualifying       \ntermination would occur if the executive      \nresigned for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or the surviving   \ncompany terminated the executive other than   \nfor \u201cCause,\u201d \u201cDisability\u201d or death (each as   \ndefined in the change of control agreement).  \nThe treatment of equity awards upon a change  \nof control is addressed in the equity award   \nagreements themselves, as described below,    \nrather than the change of control agreements. \nThe change of control agreements provide for  \ncash payments to our NEOs calculated based on \nvarious compensation components, including    \nannual base salary and an annual incentive    \naward (bonus). For purposes of the change of  \ncontrol agreements, annual base salary is     \nequal to 12 times the highest monthly base    \nsalary rate payable to the executive in the   \n12-monthperiod preceding the month of the     \nchange of control. The cash payment related to\nbase salary is equal to two times the annual  \nbase salary, and the cash payment related to  \nbonus is equal to two times the applicable    \nbonus percentage multiplied by annual base    \nsalary. The agreements also provide for       \ncontinued benefits under (or compute cash     \npayments by reference to) certain of our      \nretirement and health and welfare benefit     \nplans. None of our change of control          \nagreements contain any excise tax \u201cgross-     \nup\u201dprovisions. Our current change of control  \nagreements provide that in the event the      \nbenefits payable to an executive trigger      \nexcise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code,  \nthe executive will be entitled to a reduction \nin benefits so that no excise tax is imposed  \nif such a reduction would result in a greater \nnet (after-tax)benefit to the executive than  \npayment of the full amount of his or her      \nbenefits. We have a Board-approved policy that\nrequires shareholder approval of certain      \nfuture severance arrangements if the          \narrangement provides for additional severance \nbenefits in an amount exceeding 2.99 times the\nsum of the executive\u2019s annual base salary and \ntarget bonus. The change of control agreements\nprohibit the executives from employing or     \nsoliciting any of our officers during the one-\nyearperiod following termination, and from    \nusing or disclosing any of our confidential   \nbusiness or technical information or trade    \nsecrets.                                      \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                             99  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF          \nEMPLOYMENT While the benefits to be received  \nunder a change of control agreement may be    \nsignificant to an individual, they first      \nrequire the occurrence of a significant       \ntransaction. As a result, the benefits are    \nhighly speculative and are contingent on a    \nvariety of facts and circumstances. In        \nrecognition of this, the HR Committee of the  \nBoard does not consider the amount of         \npotential change in control payments when it  \nmakes annual compensation decisions for our   \nNEOs. Change in control protections, although \nmeaningful, also become relatively less       \nsignificant to PNC as we increase in size.    \nEquity-based grants If an NEO resigns or the  \nNEO\u2019s employment is terminated with or without\ncause, any unvested equity-based compensation \nis generally forfeited (other than the        \nLeadership Continuity Awards, which may be    \neligible for continued vesting upon a         \ntermination without cause at the discretion of\nthe HR Committee). However, if an NEO retires \n(i.e., a retirement-eligible NEO resigns or is\nterminated without cause), equity-based       \ncompensation is not forfeited and continues in\neffect until its originally scheduled payment \ndate (other than the Leadership Continuity    \nAwards, which may be eligible for continued   \nvesting following the third anniversary of the\ngrant date at the discretion of the HR        \nCommittee, and the 5-YearRSU award, which does\nnot have a provision permitting continued     \nvesting upon a qualifying retirement). Equity-\nbased compensation is also not forfeited under\ncertain circumstances following a change in   \ncontrol. Grants to our executive officers     \ncontain a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d feature, meaning   \nsuch grants require the occurrence of both a  \nchange in control and a qualifying termination\n(which includes a termination without cause or\na resignation for good reason) in order to    \nvest prior to the original vesting date in    \nconnection with a change in control. A change \nin control of PNC, retirement of an NEO or    \ntermination of an NEO\u2019s employment by PNC by  \nreason of disability has the following impact \non unvested equity-based compensation:        \nRESTRICTED SHARE UNITS                        \n                                              \n  Change in Control     Retirement or         \n                        Disability            \n  Following a change                          \n  in control,                                 \n  outstanding RSUs                            \n  will vest upon a                            \n  qualifying                                  \n  termination or                              \n  continued                                   \n  employment through                          \n  the original                                \n  vesting                                     \n  date, and will be     Outstanding RSUs      \n  paid as soon as       continue in effect    \n  practicable           in accordance with    \n  following the         their terms as if     \n  original              the grantee had       \n  vesting date.

calendar quarter of\nthe year of the NEO\u2019s death), subject to the  \nHR Committee\u2019s exercise of discretion. Vested \nawards are paid out no later than December 31 \nof the year following the year of death. Other\nmaterial conditions.The retirement and        \ndisability awards summarized above are        \ngenerally subject to forfeiture if it is      \ndetermined that a grantee has engaged in      \ncertain competitive activities during         \nemployment or the one-yearperiod following    \ntermination of employment, or if the grantee  \nhas engaged in other detrimental conduct. In  \naddition, the award is subject to grantee\u2019s   \nagreement not to solicit certain customers or \nemployees of PNC during employment and the    \none-yearperiod following termination of       \nemployment, to at all times maintain the      \nconfidentiality of business and technical     \ninformation, and to disclose and assign       \ncertain inventions. Awards are generally      \nsubject to PNC\u2019s clawback, adjustment, or     \nsimilar policies and to any clawback or       \nrecoupment that may be required by applicable \nlaw or regulations. Existing plans and        \narrangements As of December 31, 2024, our NEOs\ncould participate in our qualified cash       \nbalance pension plan, ERISA excess pension    \nplan, ISP and DCIP. In addition, Mr. Demchak, \nMr. Reilly and Mr. Parsley participate in our \nSISP, and Mr. Demchak and Mr. Reilly          \nparticipate in our DCP (although they may no  \nlonger make contributions to these plans). The\nNEOs earn these benefits for services provided\nto us while employed, and many of these plans \nare also available on a broader basis to other\nemployees. For the most part, an NEO\u2019s        \nentitlement to these benefits does not depend \non how employment is terminated. Mr. Demchak  \nand Mr. Reilly also participate in our        \nsupplemental executive retirement plan, a     \ncompany-paid executive long-term disability   \n(\u201cLTD\u201d) program, and the Key Executive Equity \nProgram (\u201cKEEP\u201d), a split-dollar life         \ninsurance program. Participants in the        \nexecutive LTD program are generally eligible  \nfor additional LTD benefits of $10,000 per    \nmonth until they are no longer disabled or    \nhave reached age 65. KEEP provides benefits in\nthe event of a participating executive\u2019s death\nwhile actively employed (equal to 1.5 times   \nthen-current annual base salary) or following \nan eligible retirement (retirement after      \nreaching age 55 and five years of service with\nPNC, generally equal to annual base salary    \nprior to retirement). Following a change in   \ncontrol, the life insurance policy would      \ntransfer to the participating executive. The  \nsupplemental executive retirement plan,       \nexecutive LTD program and KEEP were frozen to \nnew participants as of December 31, 2007.     \nCertain NEOs are also eligible to receive two \nyears of company-paid financial planning and  \ntax preparation services upon retirement.     \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                            101  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF          \nEMPLOYMENT Estimated benefits upon termination\nThe following tables show the estimated       \nincremental benefits payable to our NEOs,     \nexcept Mr. Lyons, as of December 31, 2024 as a\nresult of termination of employment in a      \nvariety of situations. These estimated amounts\nhave been calculated as if employment was     \nterminated on December 31, 2024. For change in\ncontrol benefits, we assumed a change in      \ncontrol of PNC and a termination of employment\nby the surviving company without cause (or a  \nresignation of the officer for good reason) on\nthat date. To the extent relevant, the amounts\nassume a PNC stock price of $192.85, the      \nclosing price of our common stock on December \n31, 2024 (the last trading day of the year).  \nIf we calculated these amounts using a        \ndifferent price, the amounts could be         \nsignificantly different. The benefits below do\nnot include the balances under our qualified  \ncash balance pension plan, ERISA excess       \npension plan, supplemental executive          \nretirement plan, SISP, ISP, DCIP or DCP unless\nthe NEO receives an enhanced benefit under the\ntermination scenario. In addition, stock      \noptions are not included as there were no     \nstock options outstanding for the NEOs as of  \nDecember 31, 2024. Information regarding      \nestimated benefits payable upon termination is\nnot presented for Mr. Lyons as he did not     \nreceive any payments in connection with his   \nresignation.

CAP for all NEOs is generally   \naligned with PNC\u2019s net income for 2021-2024,  \nalthough, since our PEO receives a larger     \nproportion of his total annual compensation in\nthe form of long-term equity-based incentive  \nawards, the impact of the increase in stock   \nprice (e.g., 2021 and 2024) on our PEO\u2019s CAP  \nis more significant than the impact on the    \naverage Non-PEO NEO CAP for those years. In   \naddition, CAP for all NEOs in 2020 appears    \nmuch lower relative to our net income during  \n2020, which was impacted by PNC\u2019s strategic   \nsale of its 22.4% equity investment in        \nBlackRock during 2020. This sale resulted in  \nan after-taxgain on sale of $4.3 billion. In  \n2020, net income from continuing operations,  \nwhich excluded the impact of the BlackRock    \nsale, was $3.0 billion, reflecting closer     \nalignment for the full period presented.      \nDescription of Relationship Between PEO and   \nNon-PEONEO CAP and Adjusted ROE               \nThe following chart sets forth the            \nrelationship between CAP for our PEO, the     \naverage of CAP for the Non-PEONEOs and our    \nAdjusted ROE (our CSM) during the five most   \nrecently completed fiscal years.              \nSimilar to the graph above, CAP for all NEOs  \nis generally aligned with PNC\u2019s Adjusted ROE  \nfor 2021-2024, although, since our PEO        \nreceives a larger proportion of his total     \nannual compensation in the form of long-term  \nequity-based incentive awards, the impact of  \nthe increase in stock price (e.g., 2021 and   \n2024) on our PEO\u2019s CAP is more significant    \nthan the impact on the average Non-PEO NEO CAP\nfor those years. In addition, CAP for all NEOs\nin 2020 appears lower relative to our Adjusted\nROE during 2020.

How will \nmy shares be voted if I do not give specific  \nvoting instructions? If you are a shareholder \nof recordand return your proxy card without   \nspecifying how you want to vote, the persons  \nnamed as proxies on your proxy card will vote \nin accordance with the recommendations of the \nBoard. In addition, the proxies may determine \nin their discretion how to vote your shares   \nregarding any other matter properly presented \nfor a vote at our annual meeting. In the event\na nominated director becomes unable to serve  \nas a director, proxies will be voted for the  \nelection of such other person as the Board may\ndesignate as a nominee, unless the Board      \nchooses to reduce the number of directors     \nauthorized to serve on the Board. If you are a\nstreet name shareholderand do not provide     \nvoting instructions to your bank, broker or   \nother nominee, your bank, broker or other     \nnominee may vote your shares on any proposal  \nthat is classified as \u201croutine\u201d by the NYSE.  \nHowever, your bank, broker or other nominee is\nnot permitted to vote your shares on any      \nproposal classified as \u201cnon-routine\u201dunless you\nprovide instructions.

Will my vote be confidential? \nThe Board has adopted a confidential voting   \npolicy. With the exceptions described below,  \nthis policy states that all proxies, ballots, \nvoting instructions from employee benefit plan\nparticipants and voting tabulations that      \nidentify the vote of a particular shareholder \nor benefit plan participant be kept           \npermanently confidential and not be disclosed.\nWe keep votes confidential and do not disclose\nthem to our directors, officers or employees  \nexcept (1) as necessary to meet legal         \nrequirements or to pursue or defend legal     \nactions; (2) to allow the Judge of Election to\ncertify the voting results; (3) when expressly\nrequested by a shareholder or benefit plan    \nparticipant; or (4) if there is a contested   \nproxy solicitation. Broadridge Financial      \nSolutions, Inc., our vote tabulator and Judge \nof Election for the annual meeting, confirmed \nthat its procedures will be consistent with   \nthis policy. How a proposal gets approved What\nis a quorum and why is it needed for the      \nannual meeting? Under Pennsylvania law, we    \nmust have a quorum before we can consider     \nproposals at an annual meeting. A \u201cquorum\u201d    \nrefers to the minimum number of shares that   \nmust be present at the meeting. To have a     \nquorum for the 2025 annual meeting, we need   \nthe presence of PNC shareholders or their     \nproxies who are entitled to cast at least a   \nmajority of the votes that all shareholders   \nare entitled to cast. In determining if a     \nquorum exists, we count the number of shares  \nrepresented by shareholders who attend the    \nannual meeting and the number of shares       \nrepresented by proxies. If you return a proxy,\nwhether you vote for or against a proposal,   \nabstain from voting or only sign and date your\nproxy card, your shares will be counted as    \npresent for purposes of determining if a      \nquorum exists. Based on the number of shares  \nof PNC common stock and PNC preferred         \nstock\u2013Series B outstanding as of the close of \nbusiness on the record date, January 31, 2025,\nand the common stock conversion rate          \napplicable to the PNC preferred stock\u2014Series  \nB, the presence of shareholders entitled to   \ncast at least 197,884,141 votes at the 2025   \nannual meeting (attending virtually or        \nrepresented by proxy) will constitute a       \nquorum.

Our proxy materials\nconsist of the following:                     \n                                              \n  \u25fe    Our notice of the 2025 annual         \n        meeting of shareholders;              \n                                              \n                                  \n  \u25fe    Our proxy statement; and  \n                                  \n                                 \n  \u25fe    Our 2024 annual report.  \n                                 \nUnder SEC rules relating to proxy             \nsolicitations, we may furnish proxy materials \nto our shareholders by providing internet     \naccess to those materials instead of mailing a\nprinted copy to each shareholder. Consistent  \nwith these rules, we notify shareholders when \nour proxy materials are available by sending  \nthem a Notice of Internet Availability of     \nProxy Materials, which also provides          \ninstructions on how to access our proxy       \nmaterials and vote online or, if preferred,   \nrequest a paper copy of the proxy materials   \nand a proxy card or voting instruction form.  \nWe believe this \u201cnotice and access\u201d method    \nexpedites the delivery of our proxy materials \nto shareholders and offers a convenient way   \nfor shareholders to review our information. It\nalso helps us reduce printing and mailing     \ncosts and lessen our environmental impact.    \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2025                            117  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nGENERAL INFORMATION Note that internet        \naddresses throughout this document are        \nincluded as inactive textual references only  \nand the content of those websites is not      \nincorporated in this document by reference or \notherwise made a part hereof.

Upon request, we will  \nprovide email or paper copies of proxy        \nmaterials to shareholders for the current     \nannual meeting or for future meetings. Please \ndirect your request to Broadridge Financial   \nSolutions, Inc. at the address or phone number\nprovided below.

If two or    \nmore PNC shareholders live in your household, \nor you maintain more than one shareholder     \naccount on the books of Computershare, our    \ntransfer agent and registrar, you may have    \nreceived more than one set of our proxy       \nmaterials.

This \nis referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d of the proxy \nmaterials. Even if you consent to             \nhouseholding, we will deliver a separate proxy\ncard or Notice of Internet Availability of    \nProxy Materials for each account.

Each   \nshareholder will be limited to one question.  \n                                          \n  4.

If multiple questions are     \nsubmitted on the same topic, we will summarize\nand respond collectively. We have allocated   \none hour for the meeting, including to address\nquestions. Please keep questions brief in     \norder to give us the opportunity to address as\nmany questions as possible. We will make every\neffort to address questions that are          \nconsistent with these Regulations for Conduct.\n                         \n  5.  Other Limitations  \n                         \nThe Chair may refuse to permit a nomination or\nproposal to be made by a shareholder who has  \nnot complied with applicable laws or rules, or\nthe procedures set forth in PNC\u2019s Bylaws. The \nChair may choose not to address questions if  \nit appears they have already been adequately  \naddressed or are not appropriate, or for other\nreasons. Personal matters are not appropriate \nfor discussion. The Chair will not address    \nquestions that include rudeness or personal   \nattacks or that are otherwise in bad taste,   \nand the injection of irrelevant controversy is\nnot permitted at any time.
