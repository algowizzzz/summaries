Other Events.                    \n                                              \nIn its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 (the \"2021 Form\n10-K\"), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n(the \"Corporation\") reported its noninterest\nincome through six revenue streams: (i) Asset\nmanagement, (ii) Consumer services, (iii)\nCorporate services, (iv) Residential mortgage,\n(v) Service charges on deposits and (vi) Other\nnoninterest income.\n\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, the\nCorporation updated the presentation of its\nnoninterest income categorization to be based\non product and service type, and accordingly,\nhas changed the basis of presentation of its\nnoninterest income revenue streams to: (i)\nAsset management and brokerage, (ii) Capital\nmarkets related, (iii) Card and cash\nmanagement, (iv) Lending and deposit related,\n(v) Residential and commercial mortgage and\n(vi) Other noninterest income.\n\nA description of each revenue stream is as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Asset management and brokerage includes\nrevenue from our asset management and retail\nbrokerage businesses. Asset management\nservices include investment management,\ncustody, retirement planning, family planning,\ntrust management and retirement\nadministration. Brokerage services offer\nretail customers a wide range of investment\noptions, including mutual funds, annuities,\nstock, bonds and managed accounts.\n\n\u2022 Capital markets related includes revenue\nfrom services and activities primarily related\nto merger and acquisition advisory, equity\ncapital markets advisory, asset-backed\nfinancing, loan syndication, securities\nunderwriting, credit valuation adjustments\nrelated to the derivatives portfolio and\ncustomer-related trading.\n\n\u2022 Card and cash management includes revenue\nprimarily from debit and credit card\nactivities, inclusive of credit card points\nand rewards, treasury management services and\nATM fees. Debit and credit card activities\ninclude interchange revenue and merchant\nservice fees. Treasury management services\ninclude cash and investment management,\nreceivables and disbursement management, funds\ntransfer, international payment and access to\nonline/mobile information management and\nreporting.\n\n\u2022 Lending and deposit related includes revenue\nprimarily related to service charges on\ndeposits, loan commitment and usage fees, the\nissuance of standby letters of credit,\noperating lease income and long-term care and\ninsurance products.\n\n\u2022 Residential and commercial mortgage includes\nthe gain and loss on sale of mortgages,\nrevenue related to our mortgage servicing\nresponsibilities, mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation adjustments and net gains on\noriginations and sales of loans held for sale.\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income is primarily\ncomposed of private equity revenue, net\nsecurities gains and losses, activity related\nto our equity investment in Visa and gains and\nlosses on asset sales.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s economic group recently\nupdated its expectations for Federal Open\nMarket Committee (\"FOMC\") federal funds rate\nincreases for the remainder of 2022 detailed\nwithin its March Economic Report. PNC now\nexpects the FOMC to raise the federal funds\nrate by 0.50% in May, 0.25% in June, 0.50% in\nJuly, 0.25% in September and 0.25% in\nDecember.\n\nThe Corporation is also updating its first\nquarter and full year business outlook\nrecently filed in its 2021 Form 10-K to\nconsider its current expectations for federal\nfunds rate increases in 2022, the updated\nnoninterest income categorization and more\nrecent expectations of first quarter and full\nyear 2022 results.\n\nFor the full year 2022, compared to full year\n2021, we expect revenue growth to be 9% to\n11%. This reflects our revised projection for\nthe amount and magnitude of increases to the\nfederal funds rate for the remainder of 2022.\nAll other full year guidance remains\nunchanged.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2022, compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2021 as presented in Exhibit\n99.1, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans, excluding PPP, to be up\napproximately 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down approximately\n1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income, which reflects the updated\ncategorization, to be down approximately 14%\nto 16%. Fee income is lower than originally\nprojected in the fee guidance provided in the\nBusiness Outlook section of the 2021 Form 10-K\nprimarily reflecting lower capital markets\nrevenue and business activity,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, reflecting the\nupdated categorization and excluding\nintegration costs, net securities and Visa\nactivity, to be between $175 million and $225\nmillion,\n\n\u2022 Total revenue to decline approximately 8% to\n10%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense, excluding approximately\n$30 million of integration expense, to be down\napproximately 6% to 8%. Noninterest expense is\nlower than originally projected in the\nBusiness Outlook section of the 2021 Form 10-K\ncommensurate with lower capital markets\nrevenue and business activity, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $100\nmillion and $150 million.\n\nThe information contained in this Current\nReport on Form 8-K is being furnished to\nassist investors in understanding how the\nCorporation's noninterest income results would\nhave been presented in previously filed\nreports had such results been reported to\nreflect the updated noninterest income\npresentation discussed above. The\nCorporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and\nsubsequent filings that include noninterest\nincome information will reflect this change in\npresentation for all periods presented. The\nupdated presentation did not affect total\nnoninterest income, revenue or net income on\nour Consolidated Income Statement or our\nreportable segments.\n\nThe revisions to the presentation of the\nCorporation's noninterest income discussed\nabove are reflected in Exhibit 99.1 attached\nhereto.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation\n\nWe make statements in this Current Report, and\nwe may from time to time make other\nstatements, regarding our outlook for\nfinancial performance, such as earnings,\nrevenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and\nliquidity levels and ratios, asset levels,\nasset quality, financial position, and other\nmatters regarding or affecting us and our\nfuture business and operations that are\nforward-looking statements within the meaning\nof the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct. Forward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply and\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies\nof the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n\n\u2013 The length and extent of the economic\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\nand\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to remain above\nthe economy\u2019s long-run average throughout this\nyear. Consumer spending growth will remain\nsolid in 2022 due to good underlying\nfundamentals.\n\n\u2013 Supply-chain difficulties will gradually\nease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages\nwill remain a constraint this year, although\nstrong wage growth will support consumer\nspending.\n\n\u2013 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to\nstrong demand but limited supplies coming out\nof the pandemic for some goods and services.\nHigher energy prices are adding to\ninflationary pressures in the first half of\n2022. Inflation will slow in the second half\nof 2022 as pandemic-related supply and demand\nimbalances recede and energy prices stabilize.\nHowever, inflation will also broaden\nthroughout the economy due to wage growth.\nInflation will end 2022 above the Federal\nReserve\u2019s long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 0.50% in May, 0.25% in June,\n0.50% July, 0.25% in September and 0.25% in\nDecember to reach a range of 2.00% to 2.25% at\nthe end of 2022. The FOMC will then further\nincrease the federal funds rate in 2023. Also,\nthe Federal Reserve will start to reduce its\nbalance sheet in the next few months.\n\n\u2013 Uncertainty about the outlook has increased\nwith the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has\ncreated upside risk to inflation this year,\nwhich could lead the FOMC to tighten more\naggressively than currently anticipated. In\naddition, risks to growth are to the downside.\nThe likelihood of a recession in late 2022 or\n2023 has increased.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding a stress capital buffer established\nby the Federal Reserve Board in connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, and the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nMany of these risks and uncertainties are\npresent in our acquisition and integration of\nBBVA USA Bancshares, Inc., including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures, security\nbreaches, cyberattacks or international\nhostilities through impacts on the economy and\nfinancial markets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2021 Form 10-K,\nincluding in the Risk Factors and Risk\nManagement sections and the Legal Proceedings\nand Commitments Notes of the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in that\nreport.
