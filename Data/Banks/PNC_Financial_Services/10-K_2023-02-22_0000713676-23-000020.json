Since 1983, we have diversified\nour geographical presence, business mix and\nproduct capabilities through organic growth,\nstrategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and\nequity investments, and the formation of\nvarious non-banking subsidiaries.\n                                              \n  Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.    \n                                              \nOn June 1, 2021, PNC acquired BBVA USA\nBancshares, Inc. (BBVA), a U.S. financial\nholding company conducting its business\n\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA. PNC paid $11.5 billion\nin cash as consideration for the\n\nacquisition.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC\nBank. On October 12, 2021, PNC converted\napproximately 2.6 million\n\ncustomers, 9,000 employees and over 600\nbranches across seven states. Our results of\noperations and balance sheets for all periods\npresented in this Report reflect the benefit\nof BBVA\u2019s acquired businesses for the period\nsince the acquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\n\nFor additional information on the acquisition\nof BBVA, see Note 2 Acquisition and\nDivestiture Activity.\n                                              \n  Discontinued Operations                     \n                                              \nIn the second quarter of 2020, PNC divested\nits entire 22.4% equity investment in\nBlackRock.

See Note 20 Regulatory Matters for\nadditional information regarding our\nregulatory matters. Applicable laws and\nregulations restrict our permissible\nactivities and investments, impose conditions\nand requirements on the products and services\nwe offer and the manner in which they are\noffered and sold, and require compliance with\nprotections for loan, deposit, brokerage,\nfiduciary, investment management and other\ncustomers, among other things. They also\nrestrict our ability to repurchase stock or\npay dividends, or to receive dividends from\nour bank subsidiary, and impose capital\nadequacy and liquidity requirements. The\nconsequences of noncompliance with these, or\nother applicable laws or regulations, can\ninclude substantial monetary and nonmonetary\nsanctions. See the additional information\nincluded as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this\nReport discussing the impact of financial\nregulatory initiatives on the regulatory\nenvironment for us and the financial services\nindustry.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive\nsupervision and examination by, among other\nregulatory bodies, the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC. These examinations consider not only\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations\nand supervisory policies of the agency, but\nalso capital levels, asset quality, risk\nmanagement effectiveness, the ability and\nperformance of management and the board of\ndirectors, the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols and internal audit function,\nearnings, liquidity and various other factors.\n\nThe results of examination activity by any of\nour federal bank regulators potentially can\nresult in the imposition of significant\nlimitations on our activities and growth.\nThese regulatory agencies generally have broad\ndiscretion to impose restrictions and\nlimitations on the operations of a regulated\nentity and take enforcement action, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements,\nagainst a regulated entity where the relevant\nagency determines, among other things, that\nthe operations of the regulated entity or any\nof its subsidiaries fail to comply with\napplicable law or regulations, are conducted\nin an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent\nan unfair or deceptive act or practice. This\nsupervisory framework, including the\nexamination reports and supervisory ratings\n(which are not publicly available) of the\nagencies, could materially impact the conduct,\ngrowth and profitability of our operations.\n\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws, including the laws\nrelating to fair lending and prohibiting\nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\nin connection with the offer, sale or\nprovision of consumer financial products or\nservices, and for enforcing such laws with\nrespect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The\nresults of the CFPB\u2019s examinations (which are\nnot publicly available) also can result in\nrestrictions or limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity as well as enforcement\nactions against a regulated entity, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements.\n\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC\nby virtue of our status as a public company\nand by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature\nof some of our businesses. Our businesses with\noperations outside the U.S. also are subject\nto regulation by appropriate authorities in\nthe foreign jurisdictions in which they do\nbusiness.\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our\nrelationships and good standing with\nregulators are of fundamental importance to\nthe operation and growth of our businesses.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and\nother domestic and foreign regulators have\nbroad enforcement powers, and certain of the\nregulators have the power to approve, deny, or\nrefuse to act upon our applications or notices\nto conduct new activities, acquire or divest\nbusinesses, assets or deposits, expand our\noperations geographically or reconfigure\nexisting operations.\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a\nhigh level of regulatory focus are compliance\nwith the BSA and anti-money laundering laws,\ncapital and liquidity management (including\nstress testing), the structure and\neffectiveness of enterprise risk management\nframeworks, the protection of confidential\ncustomer information, cybersecurity, the\noversight of arrangements with third-party\nvendors and suppliers, and compliance with\nfair lending and other consumer protection\nlaws and regulations, including those\ngoverning retail sales practices, fee\ndisclosures, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts\nor practices, collection practices,\nprotections for military service members and\nindividuals in bankruptcy, and the management\nof risks associated with the Paycheck\nProtection Program we participated in to help\nbusinesses mitigate the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nThe profitability of our businesses also is\naffected by rules and regulations that impact\nthe business and financial sectors in general,\nincluding laws governing taxation, antitrust\nregulation, electronic commerce, data security\nand privacy.\n\nThere are numerous rules governing the\nregulation of financial services institutions\nand their holding companies. Accordingly, the\nfollowing discussion is general in nature and\ndoes not purport to be complete or to describe\nall of the laws, regulations and policies that\napply to us. To a substantial extent, the\npurpose of the regulation and supervision of\nfinancial services institutions and their\nholding companies is not to protect our\nshareholders and our non-customer creditors,\nbut rather to protect our customers (including\ndepositors), the financial markets and\nfinancial system in general.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation and Supervision          \n                                              \nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress\nTesting and Capital Planning . PNC and PNC\nBank are subject to the regulatory capital\nrequirements established by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC, respectively. The\nfoundation of the agencies\u2019 regulatory capital\nrules is the international regulatory capital\nframework developed by the Basel Committee,\nthe international body responsible for\ndeveloping global regulatory standards for\nbanking organizations for consideration and\nadoption by national jurisdictions. The\nregulatory capital rules establish minimum\nrequirements for the ratio of a banking\norganization\u2019s regulatory capital to its risk-\nweighted assets, referred to as risk-based\ncapital requirements, as well as for the ratio\nof its regulatory capital to measures of\nassets and other exposures, referred to as\nleverage capital requirements. The agencies\u2019\nregulatory capital rules have undergone\nsignificant change since 2013, when the\nagencies adopted final rules to implement the\nBasel Committee\u2019s international regulatory\ncapital framework, known as \u201cBasel III\u201d, as\nwell as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. In\nSeptember 2022, the federal banking agencies\nannounced their intent to revise U.S.\nregulatory capital requirements to align them\nwith the international standards finalized by\nthe Basel Committee in December 2017, which\ninclude, among other items, changes to the\nstandardized approach for credit risk, the\ncredit valuation adjustment risk framework,\noperational risk framework and the leverage\nratio framework. These changes could increase\ncapital requirements for U.S. banking\norganizations, including PNC.\n\nThe federal banking agencies tailor the\napplication of their capital, liquidity and\nenhanced prudential requirements for banking\norganizations to the asset size and risk\nprofile (as measured by certain regulatory\nmetrics) of the banking organization. The\nagencies\u2019 capital and liquidity rules classify\nall BHCs with $100 billion or more in total\nassets into one of four categories (Category\nI, Category II, Category III and Category IV),\nwith the most stringent capital and liquidity\nrequirements applying to Category I firms and\nthe least restrictive requirements applying to\nCategory IV firms. The classification of any\nbank subsidiary of a BHC generally follows\nthat of its parent BHC. PNC and PNC Bank\ncurrently are Category III firms because PNC\n(i) has more than $250 billion, but less than\n$700 billion, in consolidated total assets,\n(ii) is not designated as a GSIB, and (iii)\nhas less than $75 billion in cross-\njurisdictional activity. PNC and PNC Bank\nwould become a Category I or II institution,\nand subject to more stringent capital and\nliquidity standards, if PNC were at some point\nin the future to have $700 billion or more in\ntotal consolidated assets, be designated as a\nGSIB, or have $75 billion or more in cross-\njurisdictional activity. As of December 31,\n2022, PNC had cross-jurisdictional activities\nfor these purposes of $24.1 billion.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide\nregulatory capital into three components: CET1\ncapital, additional Tier 1 capital (which,\ntogether with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1\ncapital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is\ngenerally common stock, retained earnings, and\nqualifying minority interests less required\ndeductions. As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank\nhave elected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\nAdditional Tier 1 capital generally includes,\namong other things, perpetual preferred stock\nand qualifying minority interests, less\nrequired deductions. Tier 2 capital generally\ncomprises qualifying subordinated debt and,\nsubject to certain quantitative limits, ACL,\nless any required deductions from Tier 2\ncapital. The regulatory capital rules limit\nthe extent to which minority interests in\nconsolidated subsidiaries may be included in\nregulatory capital. Total capital is the sum\nof Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, PNC and\nPNC Bank must deduct investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs\nand deferred tax assets (in each case, net of\nassociated deferred tax liabilities) from CET1\ncapital to the extent such categories\nindividually exceed 25% of the institution\u2019s\nadjusted CET1 capital. As of December 31,\n2022, PNC and PNC Bank\u2019s investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs\nand deferred tax assets did not exceed this\nthreshold.\n\nThe agencies\u2019 capital rules also permit\nbanking organizations to elect to phase-in, on\na straight-line basis over a three-year\nperiod, the day-one regulatory capital effects\nof implementing the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board\u2019s ASU 2016-13 - Financial\nInstruments\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                   Form 10-K 3\n- Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred\nto as the CECL standard. PNC implemented the\nCECL standard effective January 1, 2020, but\nelected not to implement the phase-in of the\nday-one regulatory capital effects of the\nstandard. Separately, the rules permit banking\norganizations that were subject to CECL during\n2020 to delay CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital is the change in retained earnings at\nadoption plus or minus 25% of the change in\nCECL ACL at the balance sheet date compared to\nCECL ACL at transition. For institutions\nelecting to utilize this CECL transition rule\nfor regulatory capital, the estimated CECL\nimpact was added to CET1 through December 31,\n2021, and will be phased-out over the\nfollowing three years. PNC and PNC Bank\nelected this five-year transition period\neffective March 31, 2020, which impacts the\nregulatory capital ratios disclosed in this\nReport. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for\nmore detail on CECL and the ACL.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the\nstandardized approach for determining risk-\nweighted assets for purposes of calculating\nthe risk-based capital ratios. The\nstandardized approach for risk-weighted assets\ntakes into account credit and market risk. To\ncalculate risk-weighted assets under the\nstandardized approach for credit risk, the\nnominal dollar amounts of assets and credit\nequivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items\nare generally multiplied by risk weights set\nforth in the rules, with the risk weights\nincreasing as the perceived credit risk of the\nrelevant asset or exposure increases. For\ncertain types of exposures, such as\nsecuritization exposures, the standardized\napproach establishes one or more methodologies\nthat are to be used to calculate the risk-\nweighted asset amount for the exposure. High\nvolatility commercial real estate, past due,\nand equity exposures, as well as MSRs and\ndeferred tax assets that are not deducted from\ncapital, are generally subject to higher risk\nweights than other types of exposures. Under\nthe market risk capital rule, risk-weighted\nasset amounts for covered trading positions\nare determined based on the calculation of VaR\n(including stressed VaR), specific risk,\nincremental risk and comprehensive risk\namounts, as specified in the capital rules.\n\nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated\nusing the definition of capital under the\nagencies\u2019 Basel III capital rules and, for the\nrisk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted\nassets, as our Basel III regulatory capital\nratios.\n\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain\nminimum standards for the capital ratios of\nbanking organizations, including PNC and PNC\nBank. Banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital\nratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of\n8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-\nweighted assets, to be considered \u201cadequately\ncapitalized.\u201d In 2020, the Federal Reserve\nintroduced a CET1 SCB for BHCs subject to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process, such as PNC.\nThe SCB is calculated based on the difference\nbetween a firm\u2019s starting and minimum CET1\nratio (as projected by the Federal Reserve) in\nthe supervisory severely adverse scenario\nduring the CCAR process, plus four quarters of\nthe organization\u2019s planned common stock\ndividends (expressed as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets), subject to a floor of 2.5%.\nBased on PNC\u2019s performance under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests as part of\nCCAR 2022, PNC\u2019s SCB for the period from the\nfourth quarter of 2022 through the third\nquarter of 2023 was set at 2.9%. While PNC\nBank is not subject to a SCB, PNC Bank is\nrequired to maintain a capital conservation\nbuffer in the form of CET1 equal to a fixed\n2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based\ncapital above the minimum risk-based capital\nratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case\nof PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the\ncase of PNC Bank) in order to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and repurchases of any\nTier 1 capital instrument, such as common and\nqualifying preferred stock, and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nAs a result, to avoid limitations on capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary\nincentive compensation payments, PNC must\nmaintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least\n7.4%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.9%,\nand a Total capital ratio of at least 10.9%,\nand PNC Bank must maintain a CET1 capital\nratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio\nof at least 8.5%, and a Total capital ratio of\nat least 10.5%. In addition, while a firm\u2019s\nSCB is typically determined as part of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR process, the\nFederal Reserve has the right to conduct\nsupervisory stress tests, require a firm to\nsubmit a revised capital plan and calculate a\nfirm\u2019s SCB more frequently. BHCs subject to a\nSCB, such as PNC, generally may increase their\ncapital distributions without seeking prior\nFederal Reserve approval, provided the BHC\notherwise complies with its SCB and any other\napplicable capital or capital distribution\nrequirements.\n\nFor Category III banking organizations (such\nas PNC and PNC Bank), the Federal Reserve and\nOCC can supplement these higher SCB or capital\nconservation buffer levels above the\nregulatory minimums by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer, which must\nbe held in the form of CET1 capital, is\ncurrently set at zero in the U.S. A Federal\nReserve policy statement establishes the\nframework and factors the Federal Reserve\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer.\nCovered banking organizations would generally\nhave 12 months after the announcement of any\nincrease in the countercyclical capital buffer\nto meet the increased buffer requirement,\nunless the Federal Reserve establishes an\nearlier effective date.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that\nbanking organizations maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to\naverage consolidated assets, referred to as\nthe leverage ratio, and require Category III\nbanking organizations to maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total\nleverage exposure, referred to as the\nsupplementary leverage ratio. Total leverage\nexposure takes into account on-balance sheet\nassets as well as certain off-balance sheet\nitems, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure under derivative\ncontracts. Banking organizations are required\nto maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to total assets of 4.0%, and Category\nIII banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\n3.0%. As of December 31, 2022, the leverage\nand supplementary leverage ratios of PNC and\nPNC Bank were above the required minimum\nlevel.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are not subject to the\nadditional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum\nlong-term debt requirement, minimum total\nloss-absorbing capacity or enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirements that\napply to U.S. GSIBs. However, it is possible\nthat the agencies will consider applying one\nor more of these requirements in the future to\nadditional BHCs or insured depository\ninstitutions like PNC and PNC Bank. In October\n2022, the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly\nissued an advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking to solicit input on potential\nchanges to the resolution-related requirements\napplicable to large banking organizations like\nPNC that are not GSIBs, including a\nrequirement to maintain loss-absorbing\ncapacity at the bank or holding company in the\nform of long-term debt.\n\nFailure to meet applicable capital\nrequirements could subject a banking\norganization to a variety of enforcement\nremedies available to the federal banking\nagencies, including a limitation on the\nability to pay dividends or repurchase shares,\nthe issuance of a capital directive to\nincrease capital and, in severe cases, the\ntermination of deposit insurance by the FDIC\nand the appointment of a conservator or\nreceiver. In some cases, the extent of these\npowers depends upon whether the institution in\nquestion is considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\n\u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d The thresholds\nat which an insured depository institution is\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d are based on (i)\nthe institution\u2019s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-\nbased capital ratios; (ii) the institution\u2019s\nleverage ratio; and (iii) for the definitions\nof \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cundercapitalized\u201d, the institution\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio (if applicable).\nGenerally, the smaller an institution\u2019s\ncapital base in relation to its risk-weighted\nor total assets, the greater the scope and\nseverity of the agencies\u2019 powers. Business\nactivities may also be affected by an\ninstitution\u2019s capital classification. For\nexample, PNC and PNC Bank must remain \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d for PNC to continue to take\nadvantage of financial holding company status.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the required ratios for\nclassification as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For\nadditional discussion of capital adequacy\nrequirements, including the levels of capital\nrequired to be considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\nsee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nReport and Note 20 Regulatory Matters.\n\nIn addition to regulatory capital\nrequirements, we are subject to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital plan rule, capital stress\ntesting requirements and CCAR process, as well\nas the DFAST requirements of the Federal\nReserve and the OCC.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal\nReserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of\nthe capital planning process of BHCs,\nincluding PNC, that have $100 billion or more\nin total consolidated assets. For us, this\ncapital planning assessment is based on a\nreview of a comprehensive capital plan\nsubmitted to the Federal Reserve that\ndescribes the company\u2019s planned capital\nactions, such as plans to pay or increase\ncommon stock dividends, engage in common stock\nrepurchase programs, or issue or redeem\npreferred stock or other regulatory capital\ninstruments during a nine quarter review\nperiod, as well as the results of stress tests\nconducted by both the company and the Federal\nReserve under different hypothetical\nmacroeconomic scenarios, including a\nsupervisory severely adverse scenario provided\nby the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s\ncapital plan rule provides that a BHC must\nresubmit a new capital plan prior to the next\nannual submission date if, among other things,\nthere has been or will be a material change in\nthe BHC\u2019s risk profile, financial condition or\ncorporate structure since its last capital\nplan submission.\n\nIn evaluating PNC\u2019s capital plan, the Federal\nReserve also considers a number of qualitative\nfactors. In assessing a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes, the Federal\nReserve considers whether the BHC has sound\nand effective governance to oversee these\nprocesses. The Federal Reserve\u2019s evaluation\nfocuses on whether a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes are supported by\na strong risk management framework to\nidentify, measure and assess material risks\nand that provides a strong foundation to\ncapital planning. The Federal Reserve also\nconsiders the comprehensiveness of a BHC\u2019s\ncontrol framework and evaluates a BHC\u2019s policy\nguidelines for capital planning and assessing\ncapital adequacy. A BHC\u2019s stress testing\nscenario design processes and approaches for\nestimating the impact of stress on its capital\nposition, including stress testing models and\nnon-model qualitative approaches, may be\nreviewed to ensure that projections reflect\nthe impact of appropriately stressful\nconditions, as well as risks idiosyncratic to\nthe BHC, on its capital position. Significant\ndeficiencies in a BHC\u2019s capital planning and\nstress testing processes may result in\nsupervisory directives that require the firm\nto address the identified deficiencies and,\npotentially, a downgrade in the BHC\u2019s\nsupervisory capital positions and planning\nrating.\n\nIn connection with the 2023 CCAR exercise, we\nmust file our capital plan and stress testing\nresults using financial data as of December\n31, 2022, with the Federal Reserve by April 5,\n2023. In June 2023, we expect to receive PNC\u2019s\npreliminary SCB for the period from the fourth\nquarter of 2023 through the third quarter of\n2024. The Federal Reserve must provide firms\ntheir final SCB for this period by August 31,\n2023, which would reflect any changes made to\nthe firm\u2019s planned common stock dividends to\nremain in compliance with the firm\u2019s SCB.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                   Form 10-K 5\nAs a Category III institution, PNC must\nconduct a company-run DFAST stress test\nbiennially in even numbered years and release\nPNC\u2019s projections of certain revenue, loss and\ncapital results from the exercise under the\nagencies\u2019 hypothetical supervisory severely\nadverse macroeconomic scenario and applying\nthe agencies\u2019 DFAST capital action\nassumptions.\n\nAs part of the DFAST and annual CCAR\nprocesses, the Federal Reserve releases\ncertain revenue, loss and capital results for\neach participating firm from its supervisory\nstress testing exercises.\n\nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity\nRisk Management Requirements . The Basel\nCommittee\u2019s Basel III framework also includes\nshort-term liquidity standards and long-term\nfunding standards, such as LCR and NSFR,\nrespectively.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies\u2019 LCR rules are\ndesigned to ensure that covered banking\norganizations maintain an adequate level of\ncash and high-quality liquid assets to meet\nestimated net liquidity needs in a short-term\nstress scenario using liquidity inflow and\noutflow assumptions prescribed in the rules\n(net cash outflow). A company\u2019s LCR is the\namount of its high-quality liquid assets\ndivided by its net cash outflows, expressed as\na percentage, and as calculated under the\nrules. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered\nbanking organizations are required to maintain\nis 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to\ncalculate the LCR on a daily basis. If either\ninstitution\u2019s LCR is below the minimum\nrequirement for three consecutive business\ndays, the institution must promptly provide\nits regulator with a plan for achieving\ncompliance with the minimum LCR requirement.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. A covered BHC\u2019s NSFR is\nthe ratio of its available stable funding to\nits required stable funding amount (as\ncalculated under the rules) over a one-year\nhorizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all\ncovered banking organizations (expressed as a\npercentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are\nrequired to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing\nbasis. If either institution\u2019s NSFR falls, or\nis likely to fall below, the minimum\nrequirement, the institution must provide its\nregulator with a plan for achieving compliance\nwith the minimum NSFR requirement.\n\nAs Category III institutions with less than\n$75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale\nfunding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to\nreduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each\ncompany\u2019s LCR net outflows and NSFR required\nstable funding (as calculated under the rules)\nreduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of\nhigh-quality liquid assets or available stable\nfunding each institution must hold to meet the\nLCR and NSFR minimum requirements,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, PNC had\nweighted short-term wholesale funding for\nthese purposes of $33.7 billion.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs,\nincluding PNC, to publicly disclose certain\nquantitative and qualitative measures of their\nLCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These\ndisclosures include major components used to\ncalculate the LCR and NSFR ( e.g. , high-\nquality liquid assets, cash outflows and\ninflows for the LCR, and available stable\nfunding and required stable funding for the\nNSFR, at the consolidated parent company), and\na qualitative discussion of the BHC\u2019s LCR and\nNSFR results, including, among other things,\nkey drivers of the results, composition of\nhigh-quality liquid assets and available\nstable funding, and concentration of funding\nsources.\n\nAdditionally, as a Category III institution,\nPNC also must, among other things, conduct\ninternal liquidity stress tests over a range\nof time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly\nliquid assets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity\nstress test and maintain a contingency funding\nplan that meets certain requirements.\n\nFor additional discussion of regulatory\nliquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of this Report.\n\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and\nDividends . The principal source of our\nliquidity at the parent company level is\ndividends from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject\nto various restrictions on its ability to pay\ndividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct\nparent, which is a wholly-owned direct\nsubsidiary of The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. PNC Bank also is subject to\nfederal laws limiting extensions of credit to\nits parent holding company and non-bank\naffiliates as discussed in Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters. Further information on bank level\nliquidity and parent company liquidity is also\navailable in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Report.\n\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is\nexpected to serve as a source of financial\nstrength to its subsidiary banks and to commit\nresources to support such banks if necessary.\nDodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve\njointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the\nFDIC to implement this source of strength\nrequirement. These joint rules have not yet\nbeen proposed. Consistent with this source of\nstrength policy for subsidiary banks, the\nFederal Reserve has stated that, as a matter\nof prudent banking, a BHC generally should not\nmaintain a rate of cash dividends unless its\nnet income available to common shareholders\nhas been sufficient to fully fund the\ndividends and the prospective rate of earnings\nretention appears to be consistent with the\ncorporation\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and\noverall financial condition. Further, in\nproviding guidance to the large BHCs\nparticipating in the CCAR exercise, such as\nPNC as discussed above, the Federal Reserve\nhas expected capital plans to reflect\nconservative dividend payout ratios.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nEnhanced Prudential Requirements . Under\nFederal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with\ntotal consolidated assets of $100 billion or\nmore are subject to various enhanced\nprudential standards related to liquidity risk\nmanagement and overall risk management. For\nPNC, these rules, among other things,\nestablish liquidity stress testing\nrequirements (discussed above), limitations on\nPNC\u2019s aggregate net credit exposures to any\nsingle, unaffiliated company (referred to as\nSCCL), and certain oversight and governance\nresponsibilities for PNC\u2019s Chief Risk Officer,\nthe Board of Directors, and the Risk Committee\nof the Board of Directors. Under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s SCCL rules, PNC\u2019s aggregate net\ncredit exposure (including exposure resulting\nfrom, among other transactions, extensions of\ncredit, repurchase and reverse repurchase\ntransactions, investments in securities and\nderivative transactions) to any unaffiliated\ncounterparty may not exceed 25% of PNC\u2019s Tier\n1 capital.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop\nthe set of enhanced prudential standards that\napply to large BHCs in order to further\npromote the resiliency of such firms and the\nU.S. financial system. For additional\ninformation, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this\nReport.\n\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act . The GLB\nAct permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to\nbecome a \u201cfinancial holding company\u201d and\nthereby engage in, or affiliate with companies\nengaging in, a broader range of financial\nactivities than would otherwise be permitted\nfor a BHC. Permitted affiliates include\nsecurities underwriters and dealers, insurance\ncompanies, insurance agents and companies\nengaged in other activities that are\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of the\nTreasury, to be \u201cfinancial in nature or\nincidental thereto\u201d or are determined by the\nFederal Reserve unilaterally to be\n\u201ccomplementary\u201d to financial activities. We\nbecame a financial holding company in 2000. A\nBHC qualifies to become a financial holding\ncompany if the BHC and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions are \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nand \u201cwell managed\u201d and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions have a rating under\nthe CRA of Satisfactory or better. Among other\nactivities, we currently rely on our status as\na financial holding company to conduct\nmerchant banking activities and securities\nunderwriting and dealing activities. As\nsubsidiaries of a financial holding company\nunder the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries\nare generally allowed to conduct new financial\nactivities, and we generally are permitted to\nacquire non-bank financial companies that have\nless than $10 billion in assets, with after-\nthe-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying\nnational banks to engage in expanded\nactivities through a \u201cfinancial subsidiary.\u201d\nPNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary\ncertification with the OCC and currently\nengages in insurance agency activities through\nfinancial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also\ngenerally engage through a financial\nsubsidiary in any activity that is determined\nto be financial in nature or incidental to a\nfinancial activity by the Secretary of the\nTreasury, in consultation with the Federal\nReserve (other than insurance underwriting\nactivities, insurance company investment\nactivities and merchant banking). In order to\nestablish a financial subsidiary, a national\nbank and each of its depository institution\naffiliates must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cwell managed\u201d and the national bank and each\nof its depository institution affiliates must\nhave a CRA rating of Satisfactory or better.\n\nIf a financial holding company or a national\nbank with a financial subsidiary fails to\ncontinue to meet the applicable \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d or \u201cwell managed\u201d criteria, the\nfinancial holding company or national bank\nmust enter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among\nother things, identifies how the capital or\nmanagement deficiencies will be corrected.\nUntil such deficiencies are corrected, the\nrelevant agency may impose limits or\nconditions on the activities of the company or\nbank, and the company or bank may not engage\nin, or acquire a company engaged in, the types\nof expanded activities only permissible for a\nfinancial holding company or financial\nsubsidiary without prior approval of the\nrelevant agency.\n\nIn addition, a financial holding company\ngenerally may not engage in a new financial\nactivity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire\na company engaged in such a new activity, if\nany of its insured depository institutions\nreceives a CRA rating of less than\nSatisfactory. A national bank\u2019s financial\nsubsidiary generally may not engage in a new\nfinancial activity authorized by the GLB Act,\nor acquire a company engaged in such a new\nfinancial activity, if the national bank or\nany of its insured depository institution\naffiliates received a CRA rating of less than\nSatisfactory. At December 31, 2022, PNC Bank\nhad a rating of Outstanding with respect to\nCRA. In May 2022, the federal banking agencies\nissued a notice of proposed rulemaking to\namend the regulations implementing the CRA.\nThe proposal, among other things, would\nsignificantly expand the number of areas in\nwhich a bank is evaluated under the CRA,\nchange the tests used to evaluate a bank in\nthose areas, and expand the data a bank must\ncollect and report. We expect the federal\nbanking agencies to finalize revisions to the\nregulations implementing the CRA in 2023,\nwhich may increase PNC Bank\u2019s obligations and\ncompliance costs necessary to achieve a\n\u201cSatisfactory\u201d or \u201cOutstanding\u201d rating.\n\nVolcker Rule . The Volcker Rule and its\nimplementing regulations prohibit banking\nentities from engaging in short-term trading\nas principal and having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with hedge\nfunds, private equity funds, and certain other\nprivate funds (together, \u201ccovered funds\u201d),\nunless an exemption or exception applies. For\nexample, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule\nallow banking entities to trade as principal\nfor securities underwriting, market making and\nrisk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a\nvariety of conditions. PNC and PNC Bank are\nsubject to simplified and tailored compliance\nprogram requirements because each entity has\ntrading assets and liabilities of less than\n$20 billion.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                   Form 10-K 7\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and\nSupervision . The federal banking agencies\npossess broad powers to take corrective action\nas deemed appropriate based on the actions,\noperations or risk management programs of a\nBHC, an insured depository institution or\ntheir subsidiaries, and the Federal Reserve\nand the OCC have the ability to take\nenforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank,\nrespectively, to prevent and remedy acts and\npractices that the agency determines to be\nunfair or deceptive. A finding that we have\nengaged in a deceptive act or practice may\nhave collateral consequences on our ability to\nrely on certain exemptions in, or take\nadvantage of certain provisions of, the\nsecurities laws absent a government waiver of\nsuch restrictions.\n\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination\nratings, lower capital or liquidity ratios\nthan peer group institutions, or regulatory\nconcerns regarding management, controls,\nassets, operations or other factors can all\npotentially result in practical limitations on\nthe ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new\nactivities, grow, acquire new businesses,\nrepurchase its stock or pay dividends or\ncontinue to conduct existing activities.\nFurthermore, the OCC has established certain\nheightened risk management and governance\nstandards for large banks, including PNC Bank.\nThe guidelines, among other things, establish\nminimum standards for the design and\nimplementation of a risk governance framework,\ndescribe the appropriate risk management roles\nand responsibilities of front line units,\nindependent risk management, internal audit,\nand the board of directors, and provide that a\ncovered bank should have a comprehensive\nwritten statement that articulates its risk\nappetite and serves as a basis for the\nframework. If the OCC determines that a\ncovered national bank is not in compliance\nwith these or other enforceable guidelines\n(including guidelines relating to information\nsecurity standards), the OCC may require the\nbank to submit a corrective action plan and\nmay initiate enforcement action against the\nbank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or\nthe bank fails to comply with an approved\nplan.\n\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve\nAct and the Federal Reserve\u2019s implementing\nregulation, Regulation W, place quantitative\nand qualitative restrictions on covered\ntransactions between a bank and its affiliates\n(for example between PNC Bank, on the one\nhand, and The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. and its non-bank subsidiaries, on the\nother hand). In general, Section 23A and\nRegulation W limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and any single\naffiliate to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and all its\naffiliates to 20% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing\nlow-quality assets from an affiliate and\nrequire certain covered transactions to be\nsecured with prescribed amounts of collateral.\nCovered transactions include, among other\nthings, extensions of credit, guarantees and\npurchases of assets. Section 23B generally\nrequires that transactions between a bank and\nits affiliates be on terms that are at least\nas favorable to the bank as the terms that\nwould apply in comparable transactions between\nthe bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended\nSection 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to\ninclude as a covered transaction the credit\nexposure of a bank to an affiliate arising\nfrom a derivative transaction with the\naffiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to\npropose rules to implement these revisions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve\nregulations also place quantitative\nlimitations and conditions on extensions of\ncredit by a bank to its executive officers,\ndirectors, or principal shareholders and their\nrelated interests (including any company\ncontrolled by such persons). Generally,\nextensions of credit by a bank to such\nindividuals, companies and related interests\nmust comply with certain individual and\naggregate lending limits, as well as\nprocedural and qualitative requirements. As a\nresult of the amount of PNC common stock held\nby its advised mutual funds and other\naccounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a\nprincipal shareholder of PNC Bank for purposes\nof these regulations. The federal banking\nagencies have issued an interagency statement\naddressing the application of these insider\nlending restrictions to the other portfolio\ncompanies owned or controlled by the advised\nfunds and accounts of a fund complex that\ncould be considered a principal shareholder of\na bank, which is effective through the sooner\nof January 1, 2024, and the effective date of\na final Federal Reserve rule that addresses\nthe treatment of extensions of credit by a\nbank to fund complex-controlled portfolio\ncompanies that are considered insiders of the\nbank. The statement explains that the federal\nbanking agencies will continue to exercise\ndiscretion to not take enforcement action\nagainst either a fund complex that is a\nprincipal shareholder of a bank, or a bank for\nwhich a fund complex is a principal\nshareholder, with respect to extensions of\ncredit by the bank to the related interests of\nsuch fund complex that otherwise would violate\nthe insider lending restrictions, subject to\ncertain conditions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided\nguidance regarding incentive and other\nelements of compensation provided to\nexecutives and other employees at banking\norganizations they regulate, both as general\nindustry-wide guidance and guidance specific\nto select larger companies, including PNC.\nThese guidelines are intended to ensure that\nthe incentive compensation practices of\ncovered banking organizations do not encourage\nexcessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC\nand two other regulatory agencies to adopt\nregulations governing incentive compensation\nprovided by regulated financial services\ncompanies to their executives and other\nemployees. These agencies jointly proposed\nregulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to\nimplement these requirements. Final\nregulations have not been adopted.\n\nThe trust, investment advisory and other\nfiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank\nalso are subject to the OCC\u2019s regulations\ngoverning the fiduciary activities of national\nbanks, as well as applicable state fiduciary\nlaws. The OCC\u2019s regulations, among other\nthings, set standards for the administration\nof fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern\npotential conflicts of interests and establish\nrecordkeeping requirements for fiduciary\naccounts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval is\nrequired whenever we propose to acquire all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of any bank,\nto acquire direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of any class of voting\nsecurities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or\nconsolidate with any other BHC. In reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\n\n8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nbank or BHC, the factors the Federal Reserve\nmust consider include (i) the competitive\neffects of the proposal in the relevant\ngeographic markets; (ii) the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; (iii) the effect of the\ntransaction on the financial stability of the\nU.S.; (iv) the organizations\u2019 compliance with\nanti-money laundering laws and regulations;\n(v) the convenience and needs of the\ncommunities to be served; and (vi) the records\nof performance under the CRA of the insured\ndepository institutions involved in the\ntransaction. On July 9, 2021, President Biden\nsigned an executive order that, among other\nthings, recommended that the U.S. Department\nof Justice and federal banking agencies update\nguidelines on banking mergers to provide more\nrobust scrutiny of mergers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval also is\nrequired, and similar factors are considered,\nfor a BHC to acquire direct or indirect\nownership or control of more than 5% of any\nclass of voting securities of a savings\nassociation or savings and loan holding\ncompany, or to merge or consolidate with a\nsavings and loan holding company. In cases\ninvolving interstate bank acquisitions, the\nFederal Reserve also must consider the\nconcentration of deposits nationwide and in\ncertain individual states. A BHC is generally\nprohibited from merging or consolidating with,\nor acquiring, another company or bank if upon\nconsummation the resulting company would\ncontrol 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or\na state, or if the resulting company\u2019s\nliabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate\nliabilities of the U.S. financial sector\n(including the U.S. liabilities of foreign\nfinancial companies). In extraordinary cases,\nthe FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve, could order the break-up of financial\nfirms that are deemed to present a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\n\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to\nacquire another insured bank or savings\nassociation by merger or to acquire deposits\nor substantially all of the assets of such\ninstitutions. In deciding whether to approve\nsuch a transaction, the OCC is required to\nconsider factors similar to those that must be\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve in\nconnection with the acquisition of a bank or\nBHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is\nrequired to merge a non-bank entity into PNC\nBank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also has issued rules\ngoverning when a BHC is presumed to \u201ccontrol\u201d\nanother company for purposes of the BHC Act,\nthereby causing the company to be considered a\nsubsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The\nrules establish a set of presumptions\nidentifying when a BHC would be deemed to\ncontrol another company, with the nature and\nscope of relationships a BHC may have with a\nnon-controlled company ( e.g. , director or\nofficer representatives, scope of business\nrelationships, etc.) declining as the BHC\u2019s\nvoting ownership percentage in the company\nincreases.\n\nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters . PNC Bank\nis insured by the FDIC and subject to deposit\npremium assessments. PNC Bank, as an insured\ndepository institution with over $50 billion\nin assets and controlled by a BHC with over\n$500 billion in assets on a consolidated\nbasis, is a \u201chighly complex institution\u201d under\nthe FDIC\u2019s methodology for determining premium\nassessments. Regulatory matters could increase\nthe cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to\nan insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance\npremiums are \u201crisk based.\u201d Therefore, higher\nfee percentages would be charged to banks that\nhave lower capital ratios or higher risk\nprofiles. These risk profiles take into\naccount, among other things, weaknesses that\nare found by the primary federal banking\nregulator through its examination and\nsupervision of the bank and the bank\u2019s\nholdings of assets or liabilities classified\nas higher risk by the FDIC, including brokered\ndeposits. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or\na bank\u2019s primary federal banking regulator\ncould increase the costs to a bank and result\nin an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher\nthan that of competing banks in a lower risk\ncategory.\n\nPNC Bank is subject to certain enhanced\ndeposit insurance recordkeeping requirements\nadopted by the FDIC, which are designed to\nassist the FDIC to promptly determine whether,\nor to what extent, a large bank\u2019s deposits are\ncovered by deposit insurance if the bank were\nto fail.\n\nFederal banking laws and regulations also\napply a variety of requirements or\nrestrictions on insured depository\ninstitutions with respect to brokered\ndeposits. For instance, only a \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d insured depository institution\nmay accept brokered deposits without prior\nregulatory approval. In addition, brokered\ndeposits are generally subject to higher\noutflow assumptions than other types of\ndeposits for purposes of the LCR. The FDIC has\nissued rules and guidance for determining\nwhether deposits are considered \u201cbrokered.\u201d\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning. BHCs that\nhave $100 billion or more in assets, such as\nPNC, are required to periodically submit to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution\nplan (including a public summary) that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the company could be resolved in a rapid\nand orderly fashion if the company were to\nfail or experience material financial\ndistress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may\njointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC,\nincluding additional capital requirements or\nlimitations on growth, if the agencies jointly\ndetermine that the company\u2019s plan is not\ncredible or would not facilitate a rapid and\norderly resolution of the company under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable\nresolution framework), and additionally could\nrequire the company to divest assets or take\nother actions if the company did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed. PNC\ngenerally must file a resolution plan with the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC at least once each\nthree-year period, with submissions\nalternating between a full plan and a plan\ntargeted on certain areas or subjects\nidentified by the agencies. The agencies,\nhowever, have reserved the ability to alter\nthe scheduled filing date for a covered\ncompany, request an interim update before a\ncovered company\u2019s next scheduled filing date\nand require a covered company to submit a full\nresolution plan in lieu of a scheduled\ntargeted plan. PNC filed a targeted resolution\nplan in December 2021 and received feedback\nfrom the agencies in December 2022 that did\nnot identify any shortcomings or deficiencies\nin PNC\u2019s plan.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                   Form 10-K 9\nIn addition to the proposed long-term debt\nrequirements noted above, the Federal\nReserve\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s October 2022 advance\nnotice of proposed rulemaking solicited input\non other potential changes to the resolution-\nrelated requirements applicable to large\nbanking organizations like PNC that are not\nGSIBs. The advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking solicited comments and posed\nspecific questions on whether to impose GSIB-\nlike resolution requirements on large banking\norganizations that are not GSIBs, including a\n\u201cclean holding company\u201d requirement that would\nprohibit top-tier holding companies from\nentering certain financial arrangements (such\nas short-term borrowing or derivative\ncontracts), separability requirements, the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s supervisory guidance on\nrecovery planning, and certain disclosure\nrequirements currently applicable to GSIBs.\nSuch requirements could, among other things,\nincrease PNC\u2019s borrowing costs, require the\nimplementation of new operational\ncapabilities, and require changes to PNC\u2019s\nresolution strategies at the holding company\nlevel and bank level.\n\nThe FDIC also requires large insured\ndepository institutions, including PNC Bank,\nto periodically submit a resolution plan\n(including a public summary) to the FDIC that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the institution could be resolved under\nthe FDI Act in a manner that protects\ndepositors and limits losses or costs to\ncreditors of the bank in accordance with the\nFDI Act. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the\nmoratorium that it had instituted on\nresolution plan filings by insured depository\ninstitutions. PNC Bank filed its resolution\nplan in December 2022 and is awaiting feedback\nfrom the FDIC.\n\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines\nthat establish standards for recovery\nplanning. These guidelines require a covered\nbank to develop and maintain a recovery plan\nthat is evaluated and updated annually that,\namong other things, identifies a range of\noptions that could be undertaken by the\ncovered bank to restore its financial strength\nand viability should identified triggering\nevents occur. The recovery plan guidelines are\nenforceable in the same manner as the other\nguidelines the OCC has established.\n\nCFPB Regulation and Supervision . The CFPB\nexamines PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with\na broad range of federal consumer financial\nlaws and regulations, including the laws and\nregulations that relate to deposit products,\ncredit card, mortgage, automobile, student and\nother consumer loans, and other consumer\nfinancial products and services that we offer.\nThe consumer financial protection laws that\nare subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervision and\nenforcement powers include, among others, the\nTruth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act,\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. The CFPB\nalso has authority to take enforcement actions\nto prevent and remedy acts and practices\nrelating to consumer financial products and\nservices that it deems to be unfair, deceptive\nor abusive, and to impose new disclosure\nrequirements for any consumer financial\nproduct or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by PNC or PNC\nBank. The regulations could reduce the fees\nthat we receive, require that we provide\nadditional consumer disclosures, alter the way\nwe provide our products and services, impair\nour ability to compete with other providers of\nfinancial products or services, or expose us\nto greater risk of private litigation or\nregulatory enforcement action. The CFPB has\nengaged in rulemakings that affect, among\nother things, consumer remittance transfers,\nthe qualified mortgage definition under the\nTruth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act, and payday, vehicle title, and\ncertain high-cost installment loans and may\nestablish, or modify, rules governing other\naspects of consumer financial products or\nservices in the future.\n                                              \n  Securities and Derivatives Regulation       \n                                              \nOur registered broker-dealers and investment\nadviser subsidiaries are subject to the\nExchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act\nof 1940, respectively, and related rules and\nregulations promulgated by the SEC. These\nrules, for example, require that broker-\ndealers and investment advisers act in a\ncustomer\u2019s best interest when making\ninvestment recommendations to retail\ncustomers, which includes managing conflicts\nof interest, providing required disclosures\nand exercising a duty of care in making\ninvestment recommendations. FINRA is the\nprimary self-regulatory organization for our\nregistered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our\nbroker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries also are subject to additional\nregulation by states or local jurisdictions.\n\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement\nfunctions that oversee broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers and can bring actions that\nresult in fines, restitution, a limitation on\npermitted activities, disqualification to\ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an\ninability to rely on certain favorable\nexemptions. Certain types of infractions and\nviolations also can affect our ability to\nexpeditiously issue new securities into the\ncapital markets. In addition, certain changes\nin the activities of a broker-dealer require\napproval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into\naccount a variety of considerations in acting\nupon applications for such approval, including\ninternal controls, capital levels, management\nexperience and quality, prior enforcement and\ndisciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\n\nThe CFTC regulates swap dealers, other than\nsecurity-based swap dealers, which are\nregulated by the SEC. PNC Bank is\nprovisionally registered as a swap dealer with\nthe CFTC. Because of the limited volume of our\nsecurity-based swap dealing activities, PNC\nBank has not registered (and currently does\nnot intend to register) with the SEC as a\nsecurity-based swap dealer.\n\nPNC Bank\u2019s derivatives and foreign exchange\nbusinesses are subject to the regulations and\nrequirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap\ndealers, and the CFTC (and for certain\ndelegated responsibilities, the National\nFutures Association) has a meaningful\n\n10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nsupervisory role with respect to PNC Bank\u2019s\nderivatives and foreign exchange businesses.\nThe CFTC\u2019s regulations are intended to (i)\naddress systemic risk issues, (ii) bring\ngreater transparency to the derivatives and\nforeign exchange markets, (iii) provide\nenhanced disclosures and protections to\ncustomers and (iv) promote market integrity.\nAmong other things, these regulations (i)\nrequire that, absent certain specified\nexemptions, most standardized swaps be\ncentrally cleared through a regulated clearing\nhouse and be traded on a centralized exchange\nor swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC\nBank to capital requirements in excess of\nhistorical practice; (iii) subject PNC Bank to\ncomprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory\nreporting and real-time public reporting\nrequirements; (iv) subject PNC Bank to various\nbusiness conduct requirements, including the\nprovision of daily marks to counterparties and\ndisclosing to counterparties (pre-execution)\nthe material risks, material incentives and\nany conflicts of interest associated with\ntheir swap; (v) impose special duties on PNC\nBank when transacting a swap with a \u201cspecial\nentity\u201d ( e.g. , governmental agency (federal,\nstate or local) or political subdivision\nthereof, pension plan or endowment); and (vi)\nimpose margin requirements on certain swaps\nthat are not centrally cleared through a\nregulated clearing house.\n\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to\nPNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC\nswap dealer, impose compliance burdens on PNC\nBank and introduce additional legal risks\n(including as a result of applicable anti-\nfraud and anti-manipulation provisions and\nprivate rights of action). In addition,\nfailure to comply with the \u201cpay-to-play\u201d\nregulations that govern our swap and municipal\nsecurities businesses could result in\nlimitations on PNC Bank\u2019s ability to conduct\nswap and municipal securities business with\nstate or local governments and their\nauthorities.\n                                              \n  Regulations of Other Agencies               \n                                              \nIn addition to regulations issued by the\nfederal banking, securities and derivatives\nregulators, we also are subject to regulations\nissued by other federal agencies with respect\nto certain financial products and services we\noffer. For example, certain of our fiduciary,\nbrokerage and investment management activities\nare subject to regulations issued by the\nDepartment of Labor under ERISA and related\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nWe are subject to intense competition from\nother regulated banking organizations, as well\nas various other types of financial\ninstitutions and non-bank entities that can\noffer a number of similar products and\nservices without being subject to bank\nregulatory supervision and restrictions.\n\nOur businesses compete for deposits and/or\nloans with:\n\n\u2022 Other commercial banks,\n\n\u2022 Savings banks,\n\n\u2022 Credit unions,\n\n\u2022 Consumer finance companies,\n\n\u2022 Leasing companies,\n\n\u2022 Other non-bank lenders,\n\n\u2022 Financial technology companies,\n\n\u2022 Treasury management service companies,\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies,\n\n\u2022 Issuers of commercial paper and other\nsecurities, including mutual funds, and\n\n\u2022 Other international money transfer\nbusinesses.\n\nIn providing asset management services, our\nbusinesses compete with:\n\n\u2022 Investment management firms,\n\n\u2022 Large banks and other financial\ninstitutions,\n\n\u2022 Brokerage firms,\n\n\u2022 Financial technology companies,\n\n\u2022 Mutual fund complexes, and\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies.\n\nOur various non-bank businesses engaged in\ninvestment banking and alternative investment\nactivities compete with:\n\n\u2022 Commercial banks,\n\n\u2022 Investment banking firms,\n\n\u2022 Collateralized loan obligation managers,\n\n\u2022 Hedge funds,\n\n\u2022 Mutual fund complexes,\n\n\u2022 Merchant banks,\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies,\n\n\u2022 Private equity firms, and\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 11\n\u2022 Other investment vehicles.\n\nCompetition is based on a number of factors\nincluding pricing, product structure, the\nrange of products and services offered and the\nquality of customer service. Loan pricing,\nstructure and credit standards are extremely\nimportant as we seek to achieve appropriate\nrisk-adjusted returns. Deposit-taking\nactivities are also subject to pricing\npressures and to customer migration as a\nresult of intense competition for deposits and\ninvestments. Competitors may seek to compete\nwith us through traditional channels such as\nphysical locations or through digital channels\nsuch as the internet or mobile applications.\nWe include here by reference the additional\ninformation regarding competition and factors\naffecting our competitive position included in\nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\n                                              \n  Human Capital                               \n                                              \nWe place great importance on having the right\npeople in the right roles, with the right\nskills, and doing their best work.

We are committed to\nproviding competitive compensation and\nbenefits programs as part of our overall\nstrategy to retain and recruit diverse talent.\nWe design our compensation and benefits\nprograms to focus on three key aspects of\nemployee well-being: health, money and quality\nof life. These programs include competitive\nbase salaries and, depending on eligibility,\ncash incentive and/or stock-based award\nopportunities, an Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan, a 401(k) Plan with employer match, a\npension plan, healthcare, life insurance and\ndisability benefits, health savings and\ndependent care flexible spending accounts,\npaid time off, paid maternity and parental\nleave, family care resources, flexible work\nschedules, a robust wellness program with\nincentives, adoption assistance, employee\nassistance programs and educational\nassistance, among others. Additionally, we\nconduct pay equity analyses to determine if\nemployees are being compensated fairly and\nconsistently across roles.\n\n\u2022 Employee engagement . Twice a year, PNC\nconducts employee surveys to measure employee\nengagement because we believe that engaged\nemployees have lower attrition rates and\nimproved customer outcomes.\n                                              \n  Climate Change Strategy                     \n                                              \nWe recognize that environmental issues, such\nas climate change, could pose significant\nfinancial, legal and reputational risk to PNC.\nWe support the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy by striving to manage our physical\nfootprint in a sustainable manner,\nincorporating climate-related risk\nconsiderations into our ERM framework,\nintegrating responsible investing strategies\ninto our investment and portfolio management\npractices, and helping clients finance their\nown sustainability goals. These tenets have\nbeen incorporated into our Climate Action\nStrategy that was formalized at the start of\n2022 to set us on a pathway to finance the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy. Our\napproach will be iterative and flexible,\nhighlighting five main areas: employee\nengagement; long-term collaboration with\nstakeholders, external partners and industry\ngroups; support for our customers\u2019 transition\nplans; executing on our own operation\nsustainability goals; and portfolio alignment\nover time, emphasizing climate risk\nidentification and management, and financed\nemissions calculations as initial work sets.\n\nOur governance of climate issues seeks to\nensure an appropriate balancing of\nenvironmental considerations with other\norganizational priorities as we pursue our\npurpose of helping all of our stakeholders\nmove forward financially. PNC\u2019s Board oversees\nthe environmental, social and governance\nissues most relevant to PNC\u2019s business and our\nclimate change-related efforts. Specific\ninternal working groups, engaging with\nrelevant stakeholders within PNC, then carry\nout these efforts. In addition, we have an\nestablished risk management framework that\nhelps identify, assess, monitor and report on\nenvironmental and social risks, including\nthose related to climate change. PNC\u2019s\nrecently established Climate Risk Committee\nspecifically oversees the integration of\nclimate-related risks into the ERM Framework.\n\nWe assess climate change risks under two\ndistinct categories: transition risks and\nphysical risks. Transition risks are\nexperienced as the world moves toward a low-\ncarbon economy and becomes less reliant upon\nfossil fuels. They can be reputational in\nnature or driven by changes in the market,\ntechnology and/or policy. Because transition\nrisks are typically experienced to a greater\ndegree in the short- to medium-term, they are\ndependent upon near-term policy decisions.\nPhysical risks arise from risks associated\nwith natural perils, such as hurricanes,\nfires, floods and drought. Physical risks may\nincrease due to a changing climate, and we\nbelieve such increased risks are realized to a\ngreater degree in the medium- to long-term.\nTransition and physical risks each requires a\ndifferent risk management approach, and we\nexplore a range of possible outcomes to gain\ninsight on how to best manage these risks.\n\nFor more information on PNC\u2019s climate change-\nrelated risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors and\nthe Credit Risk Management section of this\nReport.\n                                              \n  SEC Reports and Corporate Governance        \n  Information                                 \n                                              \nWe are subject to the informational\nrequirements of the Exchange Act and, in\naccordance with the Exchange Act, we file\nannual, quarterly and current reports, proxy\nstatements, and other information with the\nSEC.

As a financial services company,\ncertain elements of risk are inherent in what\nwe do and the business decisions we make.\nThus, we encounter risk as part of the normal\ncourse of our business, and we design risk\nmanagement processes to help manage these\nrisks.\n\nOur success is dependent on our ability to\nidentify, understand and manage the risks\npresented by our business activities so that\nwe can appropriately balance risk taking with\nrevenue generation and profitability. We\ndiscuss our principal risk management\noversight and processes and, in appropriate\nplaces, related historical performance and\nother metrics in the Risk Management section\nof this Report.\n\nThe following are the material risk factors\nthat affect us of which we are currently\naware. Any one or more of these risk factors\ncould have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows. In addition, these\nrisks present other possible adverse\nconsequences, including those described below.\nThese risk factors and other risks we face are\nalso discussed further in other sections of\nthis Report. Thus, the risk factors below\nshould not be considered a complete list of\npotential risks that we may face.\n                                              \n  Summary                                     \n                                              \nThe following is a summary of the Risk Factors\nin this Item 1A:\n\n\u2022 Our business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of adverse economic\nconditions.\n\n\u2022 The policies of the Federal Reserve and\nother governmental agencies and the impact of\ngovernment legislation, regulation and policy\nand other political factors on the economy,\ninterest rates, overall financial market\nperformance and banking organizations could\nhave an adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial performance and our ability to pay\ndividends or otherwise return capital to\nshareholders.\n\n\u2022 A downgrade in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly impact our liquidity, funding\ncosts and access to the capital markets.\n\n\u2022 The scheduled cessation of LIBOR presents\nrisks to the financial instruments originated,\nheld or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a\nreference rate.\n\n\u2022 Climate change-related risks could adversely\naffect our business and performance, including\nindirectly through impacts on our customers.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to risks related to the use\nof technology which is critical to our ability\nto maintain or enhance the competitiveness of\nour businesses and is dependent on having the\nright to use its underlying intellectual\nproperty. We could also suffer a material\nadverse impact from interruptions in the\neffective operation of our information systems\nand other technology, including as a result of\nthird-party breaches of data security either\nat PNC or at third parties handling PNC\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Our business and financial results are\nsubject to risks associated with the\ncreditworthiness of our customers and\ncounterparties, the concentration and mix of\nour assets, market interest rates and\nmovements in those rates and changes in the\nvalues of financial assets.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to risks related to the\nselection of accounting methods, inaccurate\nestimates and assumptions and to risks related\nto poorly designed and implemented models that\nare extensively used in our business.\n\n\u2022 We operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment and our success depends on our\nability to attract and retain customers and\ntalented employees and we are at risk for an\nadverse impact on our business due to damage\nto our reputation.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to operational risks as a\nresult of our dependence on the effectiveness\nand integrity of our employees and internal\nsystems and on third-party vendors, service\nproviders and other counterparties over whom\nwe do not have direct control.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to risks related to growing\nour business by acquiring other financial\nservices business from time to time as these\nacquisitions present a number of risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransactions themselves and to the integration\nof the acquired businesses into PNC after\nclosing.\n\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other\nExternal Factors, Including Regulation\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of adverse economic\nconditions.\n\nAs a financial services company, our business\nand overall financial performance are affected\nto a significant extent by economic\nconditions, primarily in the U.S.\n\nDeclining or adverse economic conditions and\nadverse changes in investor, consumer and\nbusiness sentiment generally result in reduced\nbusiness activity, which may decrease the\ndemand for our products and services or reduce\nthe number of creditworthy borrowers. The\nability of borrowers to repay loans is often\nweakened as a result of economic downturns and\nhigher inflation and unemployment. This may be\nfurther exacerbated by the expiration of\npandemic-related government assistance in the\nU.S., which could lead to a decrease in\neconomic activity and a deterioration in\nhouseholds\u2019 finances, particularly if\nconsumers also continue to face high\ninflation. In addition, periods of inflation\nmay affect certain of our costs or expenses\n(including increasing our cost of capital and\nlabor), erode consumer and customer purchasing\npower, confidence and spending and may also\nreduce our tolerance for extending credit.\nIncreases in costs or expenses impacting our\ncustomers\u2019 operations and financial\nperformance, such as the interest rates\npayable on their debt obligations, could\nincrease our credit risk or decrease the\ndemand for our products and services.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 15\nWhile the U.S. economy has generally improved\nsince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nnow operate in an uncertain economic\nenvironment as a result of the impacts of the\npandemic and responsive measures to manage it,\nhigh inflation, supply chain disruptions,\nchanges in the labor markets, volatile energy\nprices and geopolitical tensions (including as\na result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict).\nThese conditions may not abate in the near\nterm, and their continuation could materially\nadversely affect our operations and financial\nperformance. Such economic conditions also\nhave led and may continue to lead to turmoil\nand volatility in financial markets, often\nwith at least some financial asset categories\nlosing value. Any of these effects would\nlikely have an adverse impact on our\noperations and financial performance, with the\nsignificance of the impact generally depending\non the nature and severity of the adverse\neconomic conditions.\n\nEven when economic conditions are relatively\ngood or stable, specific economic factors can\nnegatively affect our business and\nperformance. This can be especially true when\nthe factors relate to particular segments of\nthe economy. For example, shifting consumer\nbehavior with respect to retail purchases\nbeing made over the internet rather than in\nphysical stores has negatively impacted\nperformance by some retailers. This likely\ndecreases demand for financial services in\nthat sector, possibly harming the\ncreditworthiness of some shopping mall\noperators, retail companies and others with\nwhom we do business. As another example, we\ncould experience an increase in credit losses\nas a result of structural and secular changes\nfostered by the pandemic for certain sectors\nof the economy. In addition, remote work has\nadversely affected and may continue to\nadversely affect commercial real estate, as\nwell as businesses whose customers have\nhistorically been office workers. Affected\ncompanies have experienced and may continue to\nexperience lower levels of business and\npossible declining creditworthiness.\n\nGiven the geographic scope of our business and\noperations, we are most exposed to issues\nwithin the U.S. economy and financial markets.\nOur foreign business activities continue to be\na relatively small part of our overall\nbusiness. As a result, the direct impact on\nour business and financial performance from\neconomic conditions outside the U.S. is not\nlikely to be significant, although the impact\nwould increase if we expanded our foreign\nbusiness more than nominally. We are, however,\nsusceptible to the risk that foreign economic\nconditions could negatively affect our\nbusiness and financial performance. Primarily,\nthis risk results from the possibility that\npoor economic conditions or financial market\ndisruptions affecting other major economies\nwould also affect the U.S.\n\nThroughout the remainder of this Risk Factors\nsection, we address specific ways in which\neconomic issues could create risk for us and\nresult in adverse impacts on our business and\nfinancial performance.\n\nThe impact of government legislation,\nregulation and policy and other political\nfactors on the economy could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial\nperformance.\n\nChanges in law or governmental policy\naffecting the economy, business activity, or\npersonal spending, investing or saving\nactivities may cause consumers and businesses\nto alter their behavior in ways that impact\ndemand for our products and services. Such\nchanges may also alter the profitability of\nthe transactions in which we engage or result\nin increased regulatory burden and associated\ncosts. PNC may alter the types or terms of the\nproducts and services we offer to reflect such\nchanges. Uncertainty regarding future law or\npolicy may have similar impacts. In addition,\nthe application of some laws may be uncertain,\nrequire significant judgment and be subject to\ndiffering interpretations. Congress and the\nagencies that regulate us have changed and may\ncontinue to change the laws and policies that\nare applicable to us, including their\ninterpretations of rules and guidelines, which\nhas subjected and may continue to subject\nfinancial institutions like us to heightened\nlevels of regulation and supervision and more\nstringent enforcement and potentially severe\npenalties. For example, the increased time\nframes and difficulty in obtaining regulatory\napprovals for acquisitions and other\nactivities could affect our ability to make\nacquisitions or introduce new products and\nservices. As another example, tax laws and tax\nrates may be subject to significant change and\nan increase in our effective tax rates could\nadversely affect our business, results of\noperation and financial condition. In\naddition, these changes may adversely impact\nour operations or financial condition as\ndiscussed in more detail in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cAs a regulated financial services\nfirm, we are subject to numerous governmental\nregulations and comprehensive oversight by a\nvariety of regulatory agencies and enforcement\nauthorities. These regulations and the way\nthey are implemented can have a significant\nimpact on our businesses and operations and\nour ability to grow and expand.\u201d\n\nSome of the legislation responsive to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (such as the CARES Act and\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act that\nprovided for certain commercial and consumer\nprotections) altered the profitability of the\ntransactions in which we engage, and other\nlaws related to employee benefits increased\nadministrative, compensation and benefits\ncosts to us. Other such laws may be enacted in\nresponse to other extraordinary events beyond\nPNC\u2019s control that have similar or broader\neffects on us and could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations,\npossibly materially, in other ways that are\nnot now known to us.\n\nConcern regarding the ability of Congress and\nthe President collectively to reach agreement\non federal budgetary matters (including the\ndebt ceiling), or prolonged stalemates leading\nto total or partial governmental shutdowns,\nalso can have adverse economic consequences\nand create the risk of economic instability or\nmarket volatility, with potential adverse\nconsequences to our business and financial\nperformance. Divided control of the U.S.\ngovernment may increase concern over the\ninability of Congress and the President to\nreach necessary agreements and make government\nshutdowns or defaults in government\nobligations more likely.\n\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other\ngovernmental agencies have a significant\nimpact on interest rates and overall financial\nmarket performance, which are important to our\nbusiness and financial performance.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve,\nincluding changes in the federal funds rate,\nopen market operations and balance sheet\nmanagement, have a significant impact on\ninterest rates, the value of financial\ninstruments and other assets and liabilities,\nand overall financial market performance and\nvolatility. These policies can thus affect the\nactivities and results of operations of\nfinancial\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\ncompanies such as PNC. An important function\nof the Federal Reserve is to monitor the\nnational supply of bank credit and set certain\ninterest rates. The actions of the Federal\nReserve influence the rates of interest that\nwe charge on loans and that we pay on\nborrowings and interest-bearing deposits.\nRates of interest can also affect the value of\nour on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet\nfinancial instruments.\n\nThe FOMC has increased its benchmark rates\nfrom a range of 0% to 0.25% from March 2020\nthrough 2021 to 4.75% as of February 1, 2023\nin an effort to reduce high rates of\ninflation. Although we may not accurately\npredict the nature or timing of future changes\nin monetary policies or the precise effects\nthat they may have on our activities and\nfinancial results, we anticipate that the FOMC\nwill increase the federal funds rate by an\nadditional 25 basis points in March. This\nwould bring the federal funds rate to a range\nof 4.75% to 5.00% by mid-March. We expect a\nfederal funds rate cut of 25 basis points in\nearly 2024 as inflation moves toward the\nFOMC\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\nIn addition, actions by governmental\nauthorities in other countries, including with\nrespect to monetary policy, could impact\nfinancial markets and global interest rates,\nwhich could affect rates in the U.S. as well\nas rates on instruments denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, any of\nwhich could have potential effects on us as\ndescribed above.\n\nSome of the potential impacts on our business\nand results of governmental monetary policy\nare described in Risk Factors under the\nheading \u201cRisks Related to the Business of\nBanking.\u201d\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are\nsubject to numerous governmental regulations\nand comprehensive oversight by a variety of\nregulatory agencies and enforcement\nauthorities. These regulations and the way\nthey are implemented can have a significant\nimpact on our businesses and operations and\nour ability to grow and expand.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a\nBHC and a financial holding company, with the\nFederal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC\nBank is a federally chartered bank, with the\nOCC as its primary regulator. In addition, our\nbusinesses are subject to regulation by\nmultiple other banking, consumer protection,\nsecurities and derivatives regulatory bodies.\nWe are also subject to the jurisdiction of\ncriminal and civil enforcement authorities.\n\nAs a result, we are subject to numerous laws\nand regulations, with multiple regulators or\nagencies having supervisory or enforcement\noversight over aspects of our business\nactivities. These laws, regulations and\nsupervisory activities are intended to promote\nthe safety and soundness of financial\ninstitutions, financial market stability, the\ntransparency and liquidity of financial\nmarkets, consumer protection and to prevent\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing and\nare not primarily intended to protect PNC\nsecurity holders. In addition to regulation in\nthe U.S., we are also subject to foreign\nregulation to a limited extent as a result of\nour business activities outside the U.S.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our\npermissible activities and investments and\nrequire compliance with provisions designed to\nprotect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary,\nand other customers, and for the protection of\ncustomer information, among other things. We\nalso are subject to laws and regulations\ndesigned to combat money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and transactions with persons,\ncompanies or foreign governments designated by\nU.S. authorities. Over time, the scope of the\nlaws and regulations affecting our businesses,\nas well as the number of requirements or\nlimitations imposed by legislative or\nregulatory actions, has increased, and we\nexpect to continue to face substantial\nregulatory oversight and new or revised\nregulatory requirements or initiatives.\nLegislative or regulatory actions can result\nin increased compliance costs, reduced\nbusiness opportunities, or new requirements\nand limitations on how we conduct our\nbusiness. In particular, the financial\nservices industry continues to face heightened\nscrutiny, particularly with respect to BSA and\nAML compliance requirements and consumer\ncompliance and protection matters. For\nexample, under Dodd-Frank, the CFPB has broad\nauthority to protect consumers from \u201cunfair,\ndeceptive and abusive acts or practices,\u201d the\ndefinition of which is being clarified through\nheightened instances of CFPB enforcement\nactions and proceedings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a\nsource of financial and managerial strength\nfor its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve\ncould require PNC to commit resources to PNC\nBank when doing so is not otherwise in the\ninterests of PNC or its shareholders or\ncreditors.\n\nFederal law grants substantial supervisory and\nenforcement powers to federal banking\nregulators. The results of routine and non-\nroutine supervisory or examination activities\nby our regulators, including actual or\nperceived compliance failures, could result in\nlimitations on our ability to enter into\ncertain transactions, engage in new\nactivities, expand geographically, make\nacquisitions or obtain necessary regulatory\napprovals in connection therewith, or\notherwise require us to modify our businesses\npractices in a manner that materially impacts\nour financial condition or results of\noperations. These activities also could result\nin significant fines, penalties or required\ncorrective actions, some of which could be\nexpensive and difficult to implement. In\naddition, another financial institution\u2019s\nviolation of law or regulation may give rise\nto an investigation of the same or similar\nactivities of PNC.\n\nAs we expand our product and service offerings\ninto additional markets, domestic or foreign,\neither through organic growth or acquisition,\nwe have faced and will continue to face\nincreases in state or foreign regulation\naffecting our operations. Different approaches\nto regulation by different jurisdictions could\nmaterially increase our compliance costs or\nrisks of non-compliance.\n\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate\npolicies and procedures designed to comply,\nwith regulatory requirements and expectations\nexposes us to the risk of damages, fines and\nregulatory penalties and other regulatory or\nenforcement actions or consequences, such as\nlimitations on activities otherwise\npermissible for us or additional requirements\nfor engaging in new activities and could also\ninjure our reputation with customers and\nothers with whom we do business. We also rely\non third parties who may expose us to\ncompliance\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 17\nrisk. A failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements or deficiencies in risk\nmanagement practices could be incorporated in\nour confidential supervisory ratings, which\ncould limit PNC\u2019s ability to expand or require\nadditional approvals before engaging in\ncertain business activities.\n\nSee the immediately following Risk Factor for\na discussion of risks associated with capital\nand liquidity regulation. Also see the\nSupervision and Regulation section of this\nReport for more information concerning the\nregulation of PNC, including those areas that\nhave been receiving a high level of regulatory\nfocus. Note 20 Regulatory Matters also\ndiscusses some of the regulations applicable\nto us.\n\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect our business,\noperations and ability to pay dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements established\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nrespectively. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the Basel\nCommittee and then applied, with adjustments,\nin each country by the appropriate domestic\nregulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory\nagencies can apply stricter capital and\nliquidity standards than those developed by\nthe Basel Committee. In several instances, the\nU.S. banking agencies have done so with\nrespect to U.S. banking organizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity, and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of our capital\nand liquidity, impact our business activities\nand may prevent us from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force us to take actions\ncontrary to their interests. For example,\nPNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders is\nsubject to PNC\u2019s compliance with its SCB,\nwhich is determined at least annually through\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. The\nFederal Reserve can also impose additional\nlimitations on capital distributions, such as\nthe limitations on distributions imposed in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic and the\n2007-2008 financial crisis. In addition,\ndividends from PNC Bank and, to a lesser\nextent, non-bank subsidiaries are PNC\u2019s\nprincipal source of funds to, among other\nthings, pay dividends on and make repurchases\nof its capital stock. Many of our subsidiaries\nare subject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to\nprohibit or limit dividends to PNC.\nLimitations on PNC\u2019s ability to receive\ndividends from its subsidiaries, including PNC\nBank, could have a material adverse effect on\nits liquidity and ability to pay dividends on\nand make repurchases of its capital stock,\nespecially to the extent that PNC must first\nservice any outstanding debt obligations.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements may also\nimpact the amount and type of loans we make.\nWe may be constrained in our ability to\nexpand, either organically or through\nacquisitions. We may be forced to sell or\nrefrain from acquiring assets where the\ncapital requirements appear inconsistent with\nthe assets\u2019 underlying risks. In addition,\nliquidity standards require us to maintain\nholdings of highly liquid short-term\ninvestments, thereby reducing our ability to\ninvest in longer-term or less liquid assets,\neven if more desirable from an earnings,\nbalance sheet or interest rate risk management\nperspective.\n\nThe Basel Committee continues to develop\npolicies and standards for the prudential\nregulation of banks. See the Supervision and\nRegulation section of this Report. Generally,\nas it is unclear whether or how these\ninitiatives will be implemented in the U.S.,\nwe are unable to estimate what potential\nimpact such initiatives may have on us. We\nexpect the federal banking agencies to propose\nrules in 2023 to implement the capital- and\nliquidity-related final set of Basel III\nstandards issued by the Basel Committee in\nDecember 2017.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nare subject to regular review and revision by\nthe Basel Committee and the U.S. banking\nagencies. For example, under the 2019\nTailoring Rules, certain BHCs are classified\nas Category I, Category II, Category III or\nCategory IV firms. While PNC and PNC Bank\ncurrently are Category III firms, if PNC or\nPNC Bank became a Category I or II\ninstitution, we would be subject to more\nstringent capital and liquidity standards,\nwhich would likely increase some of the\npotential adverse effects described above.\nFuture changes to the capital and liquidity\nrules to require PNC or PNC Bank to maintain\nmore or higher quality capital or greater\nliquidity would also likely increase some of\nthe potential adverse effects described above.\n\nThe regulatory capital and liquidity\nframeworks, as well as certain other\nprudential requirements and standards that are\napplicable to PNC, including related proposed\nrules, are discussed in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of this Report and the\nLiquidity and Capital Management portion of\nthe Risk Management section of this Report.\n\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly impact our liquidity, funding\ncosts and access to the capital markets.\n\nOur credit ratings are based on a number of\nfactors, including the financial strength of\nPNC and PNC Bank, and factors outside of our\ncontrol, such as conditions affecting the\nfinancial services industry generally.\nReductions in one or more of our credit\nratings could adversely affect our ability to\nborrow funds and increase our cost of capital\nand limit the number of investors or\ncounterparties willing to do business with or\nlend to us. For example, downgrades could\nnegatively impact our right to continue to\nservice mortgages. Downgrades could also\nadversely affect our ability to attract or\nretain customers, including deposits. In\naddition, a downgrade in our credit ratings\ncould trigger obligations to make cash or\ncollateral payments under derivative contracts\nwith certain counterparties. There can be no\nassurance that we will maintain our current\nratings and outlooks. For information on our\ncredit ratings, see the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Report.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe scheduled cessation of LIBOR presents\nrisks to the financial instruments originated,\nheld or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a\nreference rate.\n\nA significant portion of our transactions\ninvolve variable or adjustable interest rates\nthat are calculated by adding a contractually\ndefined credit spread to a base or reference\nrate. Until recently, LIBOR was the reference\nrate used for a substantial majority of our\ntransactions involving variable or adjustable\ninterest rates, including those in which we\nlend money, issue securities, or purchase and\nsell securities issued by others, as well as\nmany derivative transactions that we enter\ninto to manage our or our customers\u2019 risk. We\nalso service variable or adjustable-rate\nfinancial instruments entered into by others\nthat have historically commonly used LIBOR as\nthe reference rate. Based upon guidance\ncommunicated by the Federal Reserve and other\nofficial sector representatives, PNC stopped\nentering into new USD LIBOR contracts as of\nDecember 31, 2021, subject to certain limited\nexceptions. However, we maintain a sizable\nbook of owned and serviced LIBOR reference\nrate assets. For more information on our LIBOR\nreference rate assets, see the Market Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Report.\n\nAs announced by ICE Benchmark Administration\nLimited and the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority, as of June 30, 2023, the current\nform of USD LIBOR will no longer be available,\nand any alternative form of USD LIBOR\npublished using a new methodology for rate\ncalculation ( i.e. , \u201csynthetic LIBOR\u201d) would\nnot be a \u201crepresentative\u201d rate. As a result,\nmost USD LIBOR reference rate assets will\nrequire a replacement reference rate on or\nabout that time. That replacement reference\nrate will either be implemented consistent\nwith contractual terms or by operation of law.\n\nCurrently, SOFR is the alternative reference\nrate replacing USD LIBOR for most types of\ntransactions and, under recently enacted\nfederal legislation addressing LIBOR\ncessation, is the replacement reference rate\nto be used for certain LIBOR contracts when\nLIBOR cessation occurs, including those that\ndo not include terms for determining a\nreplacement reference rate. LIBOR and SOFR are\nbased on different inputs. LIBOR is intended\nto reflect the borrowing cost of certain\nglobal banks, while SOFR is derived from rates\non overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase\ntransactions, which are essentially overnight\nloans secured by U.S. Treasury securities. To\naddress differences between LIBOR and SOFR,\ncertain industry-recommended LIBOR contract\nprovisions that provide a mechanism to\ntransition to a SOFR reference rate include\nthe concept of an adjustment spread. The\nadjustment spread is applied when a LIBOR-\nbased contract moves to the SOFR replacement\nreference rate. These recommended adjustment\nspreads are based on a five-year median look-\nback of the historical spot difference between\nthe applicable LIBOR tenor and the applicable\nSOFR tenor and were fixed on March 5, 2021 as\na result of announcements by ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (the administrator of LIBOR)\nand the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the\nregulatory supervisor of the IBA) of the dates\nafter which all LIBOR settings will either\ncease to be provided or will no longer be\nrepresentative. The same adjustment spreads\nwill also be operational under current federal\nlaw.\n\nChanging the reference rate to SOFR is highly\nlikely to result in some value transfer\nbetween parties to instruments originally\nbased on LIBOR, and we have experienced some\nvalue transfer in connection with instruments\nthat have been amended away from LIBOR in\nanticipation of its cessation. That value\ntransfer arises because no reference rate will\nreplicate LIBOR exactly, and, accordingly, any\nreplacement reference rate will not behave\nidentically to LIBOR over time.\n\nAny value transfer could be financially\nadverse or beneficial to us or to the other\ncontracting parties (such as a borrower,\nderivative counterparty or bond holder).\nImpacts from a change in reference rate would\nlikely include changes to the yield on, and\nvalue of, loans or securities held by us,\namounts paid on securities we have issued,\namounts received and paid on derivative\ninstruments we have entered into and the\ntrading market for LIBOR-based securities. Any\ntheoretical benefit to us could result in\ncounterparty dissatisfaction, which could\nimpair relationships that result in loss of\nbusiness or could lead to litigation\n(potentially as class actions). As a result,\nover the life of a transaction that\ntransitions from LIBOR to a replacement\nreference rate, our monetary obligations to a\ncounterparty (or its obligations to us) and\nthe yield we receive (or pay) from the\ntransaction with that counterparty may change\nfrom that which would have resulted from a\ncontinuation of LIBOR.\n\nAnother set of risks associated with LIBOR\ncessation relates to how the transition from\nLIBOR to another rate will be implemented. For\nsome instruments, the method of transitioning\nto a replacement reference rate may be\nchallenging, especially where the contract\ndoes not provide for a transition upon LIBOR\nceasing or becoming a nonrepresentative rate,\nor where the relevant contractual language\nrelating to a potential transition is\nambiguous or inadequate under the\ncircumstances.\n\nFor example, most bilateral, uncleared LIBOR-\nbased interest rate derivative contracts\nexecuted prior to January 25, 2021, did not\ninclude adequate contractual provisions to\naddress LIBOR cessation. In response, ISDA\npublished a protocol pursuant to which\nindustry participants can agree with any other\nindustry participant that adheres to the\nprotocol to include ISDA\u2019s new LIBOR\nreplacement provisions into legacy derivative\ncontracts. However, the new ISDA replacement\nprovisions and the replacement provisions that\nhave been adopted for loans would result in a\nmismatch between the replacement reference\nrate included in our borrowers\u2019 legacy\nderivative contracts and their loans for which\nsuch derivative contracts are intended as a\nhedge. Further, although we have adhered to\nthe ISDA protocol, many \u201cend users\u201d of swaps (\ni.e. , our borrowers who have hedged their\ninterest rate payment obligations) have not\nadhered, and we do not expect them to adhere.\nFor these end-user counterparties, one-on-one\nnegotiation with each counterparty is\nnecessary to amend legacy derivative contracts\nto adequately address LIBOR ceasing or\nbecoming a non-representative rate. If we are\nunable to agree to appropriate LIBOR cessation\nprovisions with these counterparties, the\nfederal law addressing LIBOR cessation will\nincorporate replacement provisions into these\nderivative contracts. However, the statutory\nreplacement provisions may not align with\nreplacement provisions in a loan for which the\nderivative contracts are intended as a hedge.\nAs a result, addressing transition under these\ncircumstances may be challenging, increases\nthe risk of counterparty dissatisfaction, and,\nin some cases, may involve concessions on our\npart that have the effect of reducing the\nvalue of those instruments to us.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 19\nWe have other contracts that do contemplate\nthe cessation or nonrepresentative status of\nLIBOR, but they do so in manners that may\ncreate other risks. For example, some\ncontracts provide for selecting replacement\nrates in a manner that presents significant\nchallenges (such as by assuming that there\nwould be a rate calculated substantially in\nthe same manner as LIBOR is calculated) or\nthat gives us or another party absolute\ndiscretion to select a replacement reference\nrate. Some provide for determination of a\nreplacement reference rate without providing\nfor use of an adjustment spread to account for\nthe difference in the reference rates. In\nthese types of cases, there will likely be\nuncertainty surrounding transition, in\naddition to all of the risks described in this\nRisk Factor.\n\nTransitioning from LIBOR to alternative\nreference rates also may result in operational\nerrors during the transition such that the\nreplacement rate is not applied in a timely\nmanner or is incorrectly applied. This is\nparticularly true given the volume of\ncontracts that will require transition, the\ndiversity of potential approaches to\ntransition and the possibility that the period\nduring which the transition will need to take\nplace may have a short duration. Our failure\nto successfully implement the transition from\nLIBOR to alternative reference rates increases\nthe risk of regulatory scrutiny and actions by\nour regulators, including fines and other\nsupervisory sanctions. It is also possible\nthat LIBOR quotes will become unavailable\nprior to the currently anticipated cessation\ndates. In that case, the risks associated with\nthe transition to an alternative reference\nrate will be accelerated and magnified. These\nrisks may also be increased due to the shorter\ntime for preparing for the transition.\n\nTransitioning from LIBOR to alternative\nreference rates also impacts certain of our\nhedge accounting strategies. Uncertainty about\nthe application of ASC 848 Reference Rate\nReform to pooled cash flow hedge strategies\nintroduces accounting risk that could affect\nour ability to apply this accounting in the\nfuture. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for\nmore information about reference rate reform\naccounting standards impacts.\n\nTo address LIBOR cessation and the associated\nrisks, we have established an enterprise LIBOR\ntransition program. Any failure of this\nprogram to appropriately assess and mitigate\nrisk and deliver in a timely manner on\noperationalizing our ability to transition\nfrom LIBOR to alternative reference rates\ncould magnify the risks previously outlined.\n\nPrivacy initiatives have imposed and will\ncontinue to impose additional operational\nburdens on PNC, and they may limit our ability\nto pursue desirable business initiatives and\nincrease the risks associated with any future\nuse of personal data.\n\nRecently, there has been an increase in\nlegislative and regulatory efforts to protect\nthe privacy of personal data, including\nenhanced data privacy laws regulating the use\nof health and biometric data. Individuals\nwhose personal information may be protected by\nlaw may include our customers, prospective\ncustomers, job applicants, employees and third\nparties. These initiatives, among other\nthings, limit how companies can use personal\ndata and impose obligations on companies in\ntheir management of such data. Financial\nservices companies such as PNC necessarily\ngather, maintain and use a significant amount\nof personal data. These types of initiatives\nincrease compliance complexity and related\ncosts, may result in significant financial\npenalties for compliance failures, and may\nlimit our ability to develop new products or\nrespond to technological changes. This is\nparticularly true as we continue to expand our\nbusiness into new markets. We are, or may\nbecome, subject to regularly evolving and\ndeveloping data privacy and data security laws\nand regulations in other jurisdictions,\nincluding certain foreign jurisdictions even\nwhere our presence in such jurisdictions is\nminimal. Such legal requirements also could\nheighten the reputational impact of perceived\nmisuses of personal data by us, our vendors or\nothers who gain unauthorized access to our\npersonal data. Other jurisdictions may adopt\nsimilar requirements that impose different and\npotentially inconsistent compliance burdens.\nThe impacts will be greater to the extent\nrequirements vary across jurisdictions.\n\nClimate change-related risks could adversely\naffect our business and performance, including\nindirectly through impacts on our customers.\n\nThere continues to be concern, including on\nthe part of our regulators, regarding climate\nchange and its impacts on virtually all\naspects of life over the short-, medium- and\nlong-term horizons. These concerns over the\nanticipated and unanticipated impacts of\nclimate change (including physical risk and\ntransition risk) have led and will continue to\nlead to governmental efforts around the world\nto mitigate those impacts. We and our\ncustomers may face cost increases, asset value\nreductions, operations disruptions and changes\nand the like because of climate change\n(including severe weather events) and\ngovernmental actions or societal responses to\nclimate change. The impact on our customers\nwill likely vary depending on their specific\nattributes, including their reliance on or\nrole in carbon intensive activities and their\ntransition plans, as well as their exposure to\nthe effects of climate change. Consumers and\nbusinesses are also changing their behaviors\nbecause of these concerns. Changed consumer\nand business behavior because of climate\nchange concerns creates transition risk for\nPNC arising from the process of adjusting to\nthese concerns, including transitioning to a\nlow-carbon economy. PNC and its customers will\nneed to respond to new laws and regulations as\nwell as consumer and business preferences as a\nresult. Among the impacts to PNC could be a\ndrop in demand for our products and services,\nparticularly in certain sectors if our\nproducts or services do not support the\nenvironmental goals of our customers, or\nincreased losses due to the impact of climate\nchange on the collateral that secures customer\nborrowings. In addition, we could face\nreductions in creditworthiness on the part of\nsome customers or in the value of assets\nsecuring loans. We also have been and may\ncontinue to be subject to pressure from\nindividuals or groups to cease doing business\nwith certain companies or sectors because of\nconcerns related to climate change. We are\ncurrently subject to climate-related\nregulatory expectations and could be subject\nto additional regulatory restrictions or costs\nassociated with providing products or services\nto certain companies or sectors. Environmental\nregulations or changes in the supply, demand\nor available sources of energy or other\nresources may affect the availability or cost\nof goods and services necessary to run our\nbusiness. Further, there is increased scrutiny\nof climate change-related policies, goals and\ndisclosures, which could result in litigation\nand regulatory investigations and actions. We\nmay incur additional costs and require\nadditional resources as we evolve our\nstrategy, practices and related disclosures\nwith respect to these matters.\n\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are at risk for an\nadverse impact on our business due to damage\nto our reputation\u201d further discusses risks\nassociated with our management of\nenvironmental, social and governance matters,\nincluding related activist pressure. Our\nefforts to take these risks into account in\nmaking lending and other decisions may not be\neffective in protecting us from the negative\nimpact of new laws and regulations or changes\nin consumer or business behavior, including\nthose resulting from activist pressure. Our\nrisk management may not be effective in\nidentifying, measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling climate risk exposure,\nparticularly given that the timing, nature and\nseverity of the impacts of climate change may\nnot be predictable.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Use of Technology      \n                                              \nThe use of technology is critical to our\nability to maintain or enhance the\ncompetitiveness of our businesses.\n\nAs a large financial services company, we\nhandle a substantial volume of customer and\nother financial transactions. As a result, we\nrely heavily on information systems to conduct\nour business and to process, record, monitor\nand report on our transactions and those of\nour customers. Over time, we have seen more\ncustomer usage of technological solutions for\nfinancial needs as well as higher expectations\nof customers and regulators regarding\neffective and safe systems operation. In many\ncases, the effective use of technology\nincreases efficiency and enables financial\ninstitutions to better serve customers. As a\nresult of these factors, the financial\nservices industry is undergoing rapid\ntechnological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services. Examples include\nexpanded use of cloud computing, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, virtual and\naugmented reality, biometric authentication,\nvoice and natural language, data protection\nenhancements and increased online and mobile\ndevice interaction with customers, including\ninnovative ways that customers can make\npayments or manage their accounts. The\nemergence of many of these technologies was\naccelerated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic and the shift to increased digital\nactivity. We expect these trends to continue\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer\nbehavior and expectations, as well as\ncompetitive pressures, we have been investing\nin technology and connectivity. We are seeking\nto automate functions previously performed\nmanually, facilitate the ability of customers\nto engage in financial transactions and\notherwise enhance the customer experience with\nrespect to our products and services. This\neffort has involved the expenditure of\nconsiderable amounts of funds and other\nresources. A failure to maintain or enhance\nour competitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because we fail to\nanticipate customer expectations, because our\ntechnological developments fail to perform as\ndesired or are not rolled out in a timely\nmanner, or because we fail to keep pace with\nour competitors, would likely cause us to lose\nmarket share or incur additional expense. Our\nability to maintain or enhance our relative\ntechnological position is in part dependent on\nour ability to attract and retain talented\nemployees in these fields, which, due to\noverall demand, is increasingly difficult.\n\nOur use of technology is dependent on having\nthe right to use its underlying intellectual\nproperty.\n\nIn some cases, we develop internally the\nintellectual property embedded in the\ntechnology we use. In others, we or our\nvendors license the use of intellectual\nproperty from others. Regardless of the source\nof the intellectual property, if another\nperson or entity were deemed to own\nintellectual property rights infringed by our\nactivities, we could be responsible for\nsignificant damages covering past activities\nand substantial fees to continue to engage in\nthese types of activities. It also is possible\nthat we could be prevented from using\ntechnology important to our business for at\nleast some period of time. In such\ncircumstances, there may be no alternative\ntechnology for us to use or an appropriate\nalternative technology might be expensive to\nobtain. Protections offered by those from whom\nwe license technology against these risks may\nbe inadequate to cover any losses in full.\nOver time, there have been and continue to be\ninstances where technology used by PNC and\nother financial institutions has been alleged\nto have infringed patents held by others, and,\nin some cases, we, as well as other financial\ninstitutions, have suffered related losses.\n\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from\ninterruptions in the effective operation of\nour information systems and other technology.\n\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and\nresiliency of our information systems and\nother technology has become more important and\nmore challenging, and the costs involved in\nthat effort continue to be high. Our ability\nto create, obtain, maintain and report on\ninformation in an accurate, timely and secure\nmanner is a foundational component of our\nbusiness. Effective management of our expanded\nremote work environment heightens our need for\nsecure, reliable and adequate information\nsystems and technology. The risks of\noperational failures in the use of these\nsystems result from a variety of factors. We\nare vulnerable to the impact of failures of\nour systems to operate as needed or intended.\nFailures leading to materially adverse impacts\ncould include those resulting from human\nerror, unexpected transaction volumes, or\noverall security, design or performance\nissues. In addition, our ability to use our\ntechnology effectively could be impacted due\nto electrical or telecommunications outages,\nbad weather, disasters, bad actors, terrorism\nand the like. Such events could affect our\nsystems directly or limit our ability to use\nour technology due to effects on key\nunderlying infrastructure. In some cases, the\nrisk results from the potential for bad acts\non the part of others, discussed in more\ndetail in the Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are\nvulnerable to the risk of third-party breaches\nof data security affecting the functioning of\nsystems or the confidentiality of information,\neither at PNC or at third parties handling PNC\ninformation.\u201d\n\nWe also rely on information systems maintained\nby other companies. We use other companies\nboth to provide products and services directly\nto us and to assist us in providing products\nand services to our customers. Others provide\nthe infrastructure that supports, for example,\ncommunications, payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems, or information processing\nand storage. These companies range from those\nproviding highly sophisticated information\nprocessing to those that provide fundamental\nservices, such as electric power and\ntelecommunications. In some cases, these other\ncompanies themselves utilize third parties to\nsupport their delivery of products and\nservices to us and our customers. Systems\nmaintained by or for these other companies are\ngenerally subject to many of the same risks\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 21\nwe face with respect to our systems and thus\ntheir issues could have a negative impact on\nPNC. We necessarily have less ability to\nprovide oversight over other companies\u2019\ninformation systems.\n\nA number of our customers choose to use\nfinancial applications that allow them to view\nbanking and other financial account\ninformation, often held at different financial\ninstitutions, on a single platform, to monitor\nthe performance of their investments, to\ncompare financial and investment products, to\nmake payments or transfer funds, and otherwise\nto help manage their finances and investments.\nFinancial applications often ask users to\nprovide their secure banking log-in\ninformation and credentials (such as usernames\nand passwords) so the applications can link to\nusers\u2019 accounts at financial institutions.\nCompanies offering these applications\nfrequently use third-party data aggregators,\nwhich are behind-the-scenes technology\ncompanies that serve as data-gathering service\nproviders, to deliver customer financial data\nthat is then used by the financial\napplications. To do this, data aggregators are\nprovided with customers\u2019 log-in information\nand credentials, which allow the aggregators\nto access the customers\u2019 online accounts and\n\u201cscrape\u201d the customers\u2019 data, often on a daily\nor even more frequent basis. That same\ninformation has the potential to facilitate\nfraud if it is not properly protected. This\nhas resulted in incidences of fraud, including\nautomated clearing house fraud, credit card\nfraud, and wire fraud, enabled through the use\nof synthetic identities and through account\ntakeovers via these platforms. In some cases,\ncybercriminals appear to be using such data\naggregators and integrators to facilitate\naccount takeovers and fraudulent wires. PNC\nhas and may continue to face increased\nfinancial exposure due to fraudulent activity\nassociated with the increased use of these\napplications and data aggregators. In\naddition, transactions by customers on\nfinancial applications that facilitate\npayments and fund transfers have also been\nfraudulently induced. These transactions occur\nwhen a customer authorizes payment to a\nrecipient that fraudulently induced the\ncustomer into transferring a payment to such\nrecipient. Even where PNC does not have\nresponsibility for fraud losses associated\nwith any of these applications and data\naggregators, PNC could suffer increased\nreputational harm when such losses occur.\n\nAlthough we regularly update and replace\nsystems that we depend on as our needs evolve\nand technology improves, we continue to\nutilize some older systems that may not be as\nreliable as newer ones. In addition, the\nimplementation of and transition to new or\nupdated systems creates risks related to\nassociated timing and costs, disruptions in\nfunctionality for customers and longer-term\nfailures to achieve desired improvements.\n\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or\nsecurity breach of any of our information or\ncommunications systems, or the systems of\nother companies on which we rely, could result\nin a wide variety of adverse consequences to\nus. This risk is greater if the issue is\nwidespread, extends for a significant period\nof time, or results in financial losses to our\ncustomers. The consequences of failures to\noperate systems properly can result in\ndisruptions to our critical business\noperations, including our ability to use our\naccounting, deposit, loan, payment and other\nsystems. Such events could also cause errors\nin transactions or impair system functionality\nwith customers, vendors or other parties.\nPossible adverse consequences also include\ndamage to our reputation or a loss of customer\nbusiness, which could occur even if the\nnegative impact on customers was de minimis.\nWe also could face litigation or additional\nregulatory scrutiny. This in turn could lead\nto liability or other sanctions, including\nfines and penalties or reimbursement of\nadversely affected customers. Even if we do\nnot suffer any material adverse consequences\nas a result of events affecting us directly,\ninformation systems issues at other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a general loss of\ncustomer confidence in financial institutions,\nincluding us. Also, system problems, including\nthose resulting from third-party attacks,\nwhether at PNC or at our competitors, may\nbroadly increase legislative, regulatory and\ncustomer concerns regarding the functioning,\nsafety and security of such systems. In that\ncase, we would expect to incur even higher\nlevels of costs with respect to prevention and\nmitigation of these risks.\n\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of third-party\nbreaches of data security affecting the\nfunctioning of systems or the confidentiality\nof information, either at PNC or at third\nparties handling PNC information.\n\nWe are faced with ongoing, nearly continual,\nefforts by others to breach data security at\nfinancial institutions or with respect to\nfinancial transactions. Some of these involve\nefforts to enter our systems directly by going\nthrough or around our security protections.\nOthers involve the use of social engineering\nschemes to gain access to confidential\ninformation from our employees, customers or\nvendors. Our risk and exposure to data\nsecurity breaches is heightened because of our\nincreased remote work environment, which\nresults in more access points to our network.\nMost corporate and commercial transactions are\nnow handled electronically, and our retail\ncustomers increasingly use online access as\nwell as mobile and cloud technologies to bank\nwith us. The ability to conduct business with\nus in this manner depends on the transmission\nand storage of confidential information in\nelectronic form. As a result, efforts by bad\nactors to engage in various types of cyber\nattacks pose serious risks to our business and\nreputation. The same risks are presented by\nattacks potentially affecting information held\nby third parties on our behalf or accessed by\nthird parties, including those offering\nfinancial applications, on behalf of our\ncustomers. These risks also arise to the\nextent that third parties with whom we do\nbusiness are subject themselves to breaches\nand attacks, which may impact our systems.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we\nmaintain and process vast amounts of\ninformation about us, our customers and our\nemployees. This information tends to be\nconfidential or proprietary and much of it is\nhighly sensitive. Such highly sensitive\ninformation includes information sufficient to\nsupport identity theft and personal health\ninformation, as well as information regarding\nbusiness plans and financial performance that\nhas not been made public. One way in which bad\nactors attempt to harm us is by seeking access\nto some of this confidential or proprietary\ninformation, often with the intent of stealing\nfrom or defrauding us or our customers. In\nother cases, they seek to disrupt our ability\nto conduct our business, including by\ndestroying or impairing our access to\ninformation maintained by us.\n\nOur customers often use their own devices,\nsuch as computers, smartphones and tablets, to\ndo business with us and may provide their PNC\ncustomer information (including passwords) to\na third party in connection with obtaining\nservices from that third party, including\nthose offering financial applications.\nAlthough we take steps to provide safety and\nsecurity for our customers\u2019 transactions with\nus and\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\ntheir customer information, to the extent they\nutilize their own devices or provide third\nparties access to their accounts, our ability\nto assure such safety and security is\nnecessarily limited. These risks are\nheightened as we and others continue to expand\nmobile applications, cloud solutions, and\nother internet-based financial product\nofferings.\n\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued\ncredit and debit cards to pay for transactions\nwith retailers and other businesses, there is\nalso the risk of data security breaches at\nthose other businesses covering PNC account\ninformation. When our customers use PNC-issued\ncards to make purchases from those businesses,\ncard account information often is provided to\nsuch businesses. If a business\u2019s systems that\nprocess or store card account information are\nsubject to a data security breach, holders of\nour cards who have made purchases from that\nbusiness may experience fraud on their card\naccounts. We can be responsible for\nreimbursing our customers for such fraudulent\ntransactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as\nwell as for other costs related to data\nsecurity compromise events, such as replacing\ncards associated with compromised card\naccounts. In addition, we provide card\ntransaction processing services to some\nmerchant customers under agreements we have\nwith payment networks such as Visa and\nMastercard. Under these agreements, we may be\nresponsible for certain losses and penalties\nif one of our merchant customers suffers a\ndata security breach. Moreover, to the extent\nmore consumer confidential information becomes\navailable to bad actors through the cumulative\neffect of data breaches at companies\ngenerally, bad actors may find it easier to\nuse such information to gain access to our\ncustomer accounts.\n\nOther cyber attacks are not focused on gaining\naccess to credit card or user credential\ninformation, but instead seek access to a\nrange of other types of confidential\ninformation, such as internal emails and other\nforms of customer financial information, and\nmay use this information to support a\nransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have\nsought to deny access to data and possibly\nshut down systems and devices maintained by\ntarget companies. In a ransomware attack,\nsystem data is encrypted or access is\notherwise denied, accompanied by a demand for\nransom to restore access to the data or to\nprevent public disclosure of confidential\ninformation.\n\nA number of companies have fallen victim to\nbusiness email compromise scams in recent\nyears. Business email compromise scams involve\nusing social engineering to cause employees to\nwire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken\nbelief that the requests were made by a\ncompany executive or established vendor.\nAttacks on our customers may put these\nrelationships at risk, particularly if\ncustomers\u2019 ability to continue operations is\nimpaired due to the losses suffered.\n\nOther attacks in recent years have included\ndistributed denial of service cyber attacks,\nin which individuals or organizations flood\ncommercial websites with extraordinarily high\nvolumes of traffic with the goal of disrupting\nthe ability of commercial enterprises to\nprocess transactions and possibly making their\nwebsites unavailable to customers for extended\nperiods of time. We (as well as other\nfinancial services companies) have been\nsubject to such attacks. Recent cyber attacks\nhave also included the insertion of malware\ninto software updates and the infection of\nsoftware while it is under assembly, known as\na \u201csupply chain attack.\u201d\n\nThe techniques used in cyber attacks change\nrapidly and frequently and are increasingly\nsophisticated, and we may not be able to\nanticipate cyber attacks or data security\nbreaches.\n\nIn addition to threats from external sources,\ninsider threats represent a significant risk\nto us. Insiders, including those having\nlegitimate access to our systems and the\ninformation contained in them, have the\neasiest opportunity to make inappropriate use\nof the systems and information. Addressing\nthat risk requires understanding not only how\nto protect us from unauthorized use and\ndisclosure of data, but also how to engage\nbehavioral analytics and other tools to\nidentify potential internal threats before any\ndamage is done. In addition, due to the\nincrease in the number of employees who work\nremotely, the opportunity for insiders to\ngrant access to third parties or to disclose\nconfidential information of PNC or its\ncustomers has increased. As more work is\nconducted outside of PNC\u2019s facilities, the\nrisk of improper access to PNC\u2019s network or\nconfidential information has increased,\nincluding for reasons such as a failure by an\nemployee or contractor to secure a device with\nPNC access.\n\nWe are and have been the target of some of\nthese types of cyber attacks. To date, none of\nthese types of cyber attacks has had a\nmaterial impact on us. Nonetheless, we cannot\nentirely block efforts by bad actors to harm\nus, and there can be no assurance that future\ncyber attacks will not be material. While we\nmaintain insurance coverage that may cover\ncertain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all\nlosses. As a result, we could suffer material\nfinancial and reputational losses in the\nfuture from any of these or other types of\nattacks or the public perception that such an\nattack on our systems has been successful,\nwhether or not this perception is correct.\nAttacks on others, some of which have led to\nserious adverse consequences, demonstrate the\nrisks posed by new and evolving types of cyber\nattacks. Our ability to protect confidential\nor proprietary information is even more\nlimited with respect to information held by\nthird parties. We may suffer reputational\ndamage or legal liability for unauthorized\naccess to customer information held by third\nparties, even if we were in fact not\nresponsible for preventing such access and had\nno reasonable way of preventing it.\n\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk\nof failures or breaches occurring in our\ninformation systems and to mitigate the impact\nwhen they do.\n\nWe have policies, procedures and systems\n(including cybersecurity and business\ncontinuity programs) designed to prevent or\nlimit the effect of possible failures,\ninterruptions or breaches in security of\ninformation systems. In recent years, we have\ndevoted significant resources toward improving\nthe reliability of our systems and their\nsecurity against external and internal threats\nand expect to continue to do so in the future.\nWe design our business continuity and other\ninformation and technology risk management\nprograms to manage our capabilities to provide\nservices in the case of an event resulting in\nmaterial disruptions of business activities\naffecting our employees, facilities,\ntechnology or suppliers. We cannot guarantee\nthe effectiveness of our policies, procedures\nand systems to protect us in any future\nsituation, nor the effectiveness of our\noversight of risk at third parties. Although\nwe have policies, procedures and systems\ndesigned to mitigate third-party risk, our\nability to implement policies, procedures and\nsystems designed to prevent or\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 23\nlimit the effect of possible failures,\ninterruptions or breaches in security of\ninformation systems with respect to third-\nparty systems and the financial services\nindustry infrastructure is necessarily\nlimited. Should an adverse event affecting\nanother company\u2019s systems occur, we may not\nhave financial protection from the other\ncompany sufficient to compensate us or\notherwise protect us from the consequences.\n\nMethods used by others to attack information\nsystems change frequently (with generally\nincreasing sophistication). A new method of\nattack often is not recognized until launched\nagainst a target. Attacks in some cases appear\nto be supported by foreign governments or\nother well-financed entities and often\noriginate from less regulated and remote areas\naround the world. As a result, we may be\nunable to implement adequate preventive\nmeasures to address these methods in advance\nof attacks.\n\nEven with our proactive and defensive measures\nin place, adverse events are likely to occur,\nand there remains the risk that one or more\nsuch events would be material to PNC. Our\nability to mitigate the adverse consequences\nof such occurrences is in part dependent on\nthe quality of our business continuity\nplanning, our ability to understand threats to\nus from a holistic perspective, and our\nability to anticipate the timing and nature of\nany such event that occurs, with novel or\nunusual events posing a greater risk. It is\nalso the case that an adverse event may go\nundetected for a period of time, with the\nadverse consequences likely greater the longer\nit takes to discover the problem. In many\ncases, it also depends on the preparedness and\nresponses of national or regional governments,\nincluding emergency responders, or on the part\nof other organizations and businesses with\nwhich we deal. Additionally, our failure to\ncommunicate cyber incidents appropriately to\nrelevant parties could result in regulatory,\nlegal, operational and reputational risk.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Business of Banking    \n                                              \nOur business and financial results are subject\nto risks associated with the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business. It results from, among\nother things, extending credit to customers,\npurchasing securities, and entering into\nfinancial derivative transactions and certain\nguarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our\nmost significant risks, particularly given the\nhigh percentage of our assets represented\ndirectly or indirectly by loans and securities\nand the importance of lending activity to our\noverall business. We manage credit risk by\nassessing and monitoring the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties, by\ndiversifying our loan portfolio, by obtaining\nand monitoring collateral for certain\nexposures and by investing primarily in high\nquality securities.\n\nA borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan can be\nadversely affected by many factors. Individual\nborrowers can be affected, for example, by\ndeclines in income, job losses, health issues\nor family issues. Commercial borrowers can be\naffected, for example, by poor business\nperformance, changes in customer behavior or\ncatastrophic losses. Weakness in the economy\nor in financial markets would typically\nadversely impact the ability of our borrowers\nto repay outstanding loans. We are exposed to\nincreased credit risk if we fail to evaluate\nproperly at origination the likely ability of\na borrower to repay a loan. Properly\nestimating the current and potential value of\nany collateral pledged to support the loan\nalso is critical to effectively managing\ncredit risk. A failure to identify declining\ncreditworthiness of a borrower or declining\ncollateral value at a time when remedial\nactions could reduce our exposure also\nincreases credit risk. Any decrease in our\nborrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans likely would\nresult in higher levels of nonperforming\nloans, net charge-offs, provision for credit\nlosses and valuation adjustments on loans held\nfor sale. Managing credit risk effectively\nalso relies on forecasts of future overall\neconomic conditions, which are inherently\nimperfect.\n\nIn addition to credit risk associated with our\nlending activities, we have credit risk\narising from many other types of business\nrelationships. Routine transactions give us\ncredit exposure to brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds, other institutional clients, as\nwell as vendors and other non-financial\nentities.\n\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when the\nvalue of collateral held by us to secure\nobligations to us cannot be realized,\nincluding because of legal or regulatory\nchanges, or is liquidated at prices that are\nnot sufficient to recover the full amount of\nthe loan or derivative exposure due to us. In\naddition, credit risk may be exacerbated when\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\n\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and\nlease portfolio through our ACL estimated\nunder CECL. Under CECL, the ACL reflects\nexpected lifetime losses, which has led and\ncould continue to lead to volatility in the\nallowance and the provision for credit losses\nas economic forecasts, actual credit\nperformance and other factors used in the loss\nestimating process change. We also have\nreserves for unfunded loan commitments and\nletters of credit. Changes to expected losses\nare reflected in net income through provision\nfor credit losses. A worsening of economic\nconditions or our economic outlook or an\nincrease in credit risk, particularly\nfollowing a period of good economic\nconditions, would likely lead to an increase\nin provision for credit losses with a\nresulting reduction in our net income and an\nincrease to our allowance. Conversely, an\nimprovement of economic conditions or our\neconomic outlook, particularly following a\nperiod of poor economic conditions, could\nresult in a recapture of provision for credit\nlosses for a period of time with a resulting\nincrease in our net income and decrease in our\nallowance that is not likely to be sustained\nand that may obscure actual current operations\nand financial performance.\n\nThe concentration and mix of our assets could\nincrease the potential for significant credit\nlosses.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often\nhave heightened credit exposure to a\nparticular industry, geography, asset class or\nfinancial market. As an example, loans secured\nby commercial and residential real estate\ntypically represent a significant percentage\nof our overall credit portfolio. They also\nrepresent a portion of the assets underlying\nour investment securities. Although there are\nlimitations on the extent of total exposure to\nan individual consumer or business borrower,\nevents adversely affecting specific\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\ncustomers or counterparties, industries,\ngeographies, asset classes or financial\nmarkets, including a decline in their\ncreditworthiness or a worsening overall risk\nprofile, could materially and adversely affect\nus. For example, any downturn in the condition\nof the U.S. housing market could result in\nsignificant write-downs of asset values tied\nto residential real estate. Declining economic\nconditions also may impact commercial\nborrowers more than consumer borrowers, or\nvice versa. In addition, we execute\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial services industries. Financial\nservices institutions are interrelated because\nof trading, funding, clearing or other\nrelationships. As a result, uncertainty about\nthe stability of other financial services\ninstitutions could lead to market-wide losses\nand defaults. Thus, the concentration and mix\nof our assets may affect the severity of the\nimpact of recessions or other economic\ndownturns on us.\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nimpacted significantly by market interest\nrates and movements in those rates.\n\nAs a result of the high percentage of our\nassets and liabilities that are in the form of\ninterest-bearing or interest-related\ninstruments, changes in interest rates, in the\nshape of the yield curve, or in spreads\nbetween different market interest rates can\nhave a material effect on our business, our\nprofitability and the value of our financial\nassets and liabilities. For example:\n\n\u2022 Changes in interest rates or interest rate\nspreads affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets such as loans\nand investment securities and the interest\nthat we pay on liabilities such as deposits\nand borrowings, which impacts our overall net\ninterest income and margin as well as our\nprofitability.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can affect the ability of\nborrowers to meet obligations under variable\nor adjustable rate loans and other debt\ninstruments and can, in turn, increase our\ncredit losses on those assets.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can decrease the demand for\ninterest rate-based products and services,\nincluding loans and deposit accounts.\n\n\u2022 Such changes affect our hedging of various\nforms of market and interest rate risk and may\ndecrease the effectiveness of those hedges in\nhelping to manage such risks.\n\n\u2022 Movements in interest rates also affect loan\nprepayment speeds and could result in\nimpairments of mortgage servicing assets or\notherwise affect the profitability of such\nassets.\n\n\u2022 Increases in interest rates likely lower the\nprice we would receive on fixed-rate customer\nobligations if we were to sell them.\n\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments\nadjust promptly in accordance with changes in\nmarket rates, while others adjust only\nperiodically or are fixed throughout a defined\nterm. As a result, the impact of changes in\ninterest rates can be either increased or\ndiluted due to differences in the relative\nvariability of the rates paid on our\nliabilities in relation to the rates received\non our assets. The extent to which we have\nelected to hedge interest rate risk through\ninterest rate swaps also affects the impact of\nrate changes. We attempt to manage the balance\nsheet to increase our benefit or reduce\nnegative impacts from future movements in\ninterest rates, but failures to anticipate\nactual movements may have the opposite result.\nIn addition, we do not generally hedge all of\nour risk and the fact that we attempt to hedge\nany risk does not mean we will be successful.\n\nWhile higher interest rates generally enhance\nour ability to grow our net interest income,\nthere are risks associated with a rising\ninterest rate environment. As a general\nmatter, increasing rates tend to decrease the\nvalue of fixed-rate financial instruments held\non our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cOur business and financial\nperformance are vulnerable to the impact of\nchanges in the values of financial assets.\u201d\nAlso, customers may be less willing or able\noverall to borrow at higher rates. Higher\ninterest rates may indirectly affect the value\nof asset classes such as real estate typically\nfinanced through secured loans, with a\nresulting negative effect on collateral\nsecuring such loans. As another example, there\nmay be increased competitive pressures as\nrates on deposit products rise. The benefits\nof higher interest rates are best achieved if\nwe can increase the rates on loans and other\nassets faster than the rates on deposits and\nother liabilities increase. We may not be able\nto achieve this result in a rising rate\nenvironment.\n\nOn the other hand, lower interest rates tend\nto have a negative impact on our net interest\nmargin, and, unless offset by higher earning\nassets, on our net interest income. Moreover,\na negative interest rate environment, in which\ninterest rates drop below zero either broadly\nor for some types of instruments, could reduce\nour net interest margin and net interest\nincome due to a likely decline in the interest\nwe could earn on loans and other earning\nassets, while also likely requiring us to pay\nto maintain our deposits with the Federal\nReserve Bank. In addition, our systems may not\nbe able to handle adequately a negative\ninterest rate environment and not all variable\nrate instruments are designed for such a\ncircumstance.\n\nWe discuss the impact of governmental monetary\npolicy on interest rates in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cThe policies of the Federal Reserve\nand other governmental agencies have a\nsignificant impact on interest rates and\noverall financial market performance, which\nare important to our business and financial\nperformance.\u201d\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of changes in the\nvalues of financial assets.\n\nAs a financial institution, a substantial\nmajority of our assets and liabilities are\nfinancial in nature. Examples include loans,\nsecurities, servicing rights, deposits and\nborrowings. Such assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value, often significantly, due\nto movements in the financial markets or\nmarket volatility as well as developments\nspecific to the asset or liability in\nquestion. The underlying value of assets under\nlease or securing an obligation generally\ndecreases due to increases in supply or\ndecreases in demand for the asset or\ndeterioration in the condition of the asset.\nThis could negatively impact the ability to\ncollect fully on the secured obligation.\nCredit-based assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value due to changes in the\nperceived creditworthiness of borrowers or\nother counterparties and due to changes in\nmarket interest rates.\n\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and\nliabilities to market and recognize such\nchanges either through net income or OCI.\nThus, gains or losses on these assets and\nliabilities can have a direct impact on our\nresults of operations and financial\nperformance, unless we have\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 25\neffectively hedged our exposures. We may need\nto record losses in the value of financial\nassets even where our expectation of realizing\nthe face value of the underlying instrument\nhas not changed. Our remaining assets and\nliabilities are not marked to market. As a\nresult, our balance sheet does not precisely\nrepresent the fair market value of our\nfinancial assets and liabilities.\n\nIn addition, asset management revenue is\nearned primarily based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the assets being managed and thus is\nimpacted by general changes in market\nvaluations. Thus, although we are not directly\nimpacted by changes in the value of such\nassets, decreases in the value of those assets\nwould affect related noninterest income.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nOur asset and liability valuations and the\ndetermination of the amount of loss allowances\nand impairments taken on our assets are highly\nsubjective. Our estimates could materially\nimpact our results of operations or financial\nposition.\n\nOur accounting policies are key to how we\nreport our financial condition and results of\noperations. We must exercise judgment in\nselecting and applying many of these policies\nand methods to comply with GAAP and reflect\nmanagement\u2019s judgment regarding the most\nappropriate manner to report PNC\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nManagement\u2019s selection of a particular\naccounting policy to apply, while reasonable\nand appropriate, could result in PNC reporting\ndifferent results than would have been\nreported under a different alternative. In\naddition, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, SEC and other regulatory agencies may\nissue new or amend existing accounting and\nreporting standards or change existing\ninterpretations of those standards that could\nmaterially affect our financial statements. In\nsome cases, PNC may be required to\nretrospectively apply a new or amended\nstandard resulting in changes to previously\nreported financial results.\n\nCertain accounting policies require that we\nuse estimates, assumptions and judgments in\npreparing our financial statements, including\nin determining credit loss reserves, reserves\nrelated to legal proceedings and the fair\nvalue of certain assets and liabilities, among\nother items. These policies require management\nto make difficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are inherently\nuncertain, and different amounts could be\nreported under different conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. For example, CECL\nrequires us to make difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about economic and market\nconditions in determining the ACL.\n\nSome of our financial instruments, including\ncertain derivatives, debt securities, loans,\nMSRs and private equity investments, among\nother items, require a determination of their\nfair value for our financial statements.\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value\ninherently result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Changes in\nunderlying factors or assumptions in any of\nthe areas underlying our estimates could\nmaterially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations. During\nperiods of market disruption, it would be\ndifficult to value certain assets if trading\nbecomes less frequent and/or market data\nbecomes less observable. There may be certain\nasset classes that were historically traded in\nactive markets with significant observable\ndata that rapidly become illiquid due to\nmarket volatility, a loss in market confidence\nor other factors. In addition, we have assets\nand liabilities carried at fair value that are\nestimated using unobservable inputs that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities. The valuation of any asset or\nliability substantially based on unobservable\ninputs is necessarily less reliable than those\nbased on active trading markets. Further,\nrapidly changing and unprecedented market\nconditions could materially impact the\nvaluation of assets as reported within our\nconsolidated financial statements. Our ability\nto hedge exposure is in part dependent on our\nability to value the related assets or\nliabilities.\n\nThe determination of the amount of loss\nallowances and asset impairments varies by\nasset type and is based upon our periodic\nevaluation and assessment of known and\ninherent risks associated with the respective\nasset class. Management updates its\nevaluations regularly and reflects changes in\nallowances and impairments in operations as\nsuch evaluations are revised. Although we have\npolicies and procedures in place to determine\nloss allowance and asset impairments, due to\nthe subjective nature of this area, the level\nof impairments taken, and allowances reflected\nin our financial statements may not accurately\nreflect the actual level of risk and the\namount of future losses.\n\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in our business.\n\nWe rely on models to measure risks and to\nestimate many financial values. We use models\nthroughout many areas of our business, relying\non them to inform decision making. Examples of\nareas where we use models include determining\nthe pricing of various products, identifying\npotentially fraudulent transactions, grading\nloans and extending credit, measuring interest\nrate and other market risks, predicting or\nestimating losses, and assessing capital\nadequacy. We depend significantly on models\nfor credit loss accounting under CECL, capital\nstress testing and estimating the value of\nitems in our financial statements.\n\nModels generally predict or infer certain\nfinancial outcomes, leveraging historical data\nand assumptions as to the future, often with\nrespect to macroeconomic conditions.\nDevelopment and implementation of some of\nthese models, such as the models for credit\nloss accounting under CECL, require us to make\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nPoorly designed or implemented models,\nincluding in the choice of relevant historical\ndata or forward-looking assumptions, present\nthe risk that our business decisions based on\ninformation incorporating model output will be\nadversely affected due to the inadequacy of\nthat information. For example, our models may\nnot be effective if historical data does not\naccurately represent future events or\nenvironments or if our models rely on\nerroneous data, formulas, algorithms or\nassumptions and our internal model review\nprocesses fail to detect and address these\nflaws.\n\nModels, if flawed, could cause information we\nprovide to the public or to our regulators to\nbe inaccurate or misleading. Some of the\ndecisions that our regulators make, including\nthose related to capital distribution to our\nshareholders, would likely be affected\nadversely if they perceive that the quality of\nthe relevant models we use is insufficient.\nFinally, flaws in our models that negatively\n\n26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nimpact our customers or our ability to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations could\nnegatively affect our reputation or result in\nfines and penalties from our regulators.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Our Need for Customers     \n                                              \nOur success depends on our ability to attract\nand retain customers for our products and\nservices.\n\nOur performance is subject to risks associated\nwith declines in customer demand for our\nproducts and services. As a result of the\nnature of those products and services, we are\nparticularly at risk for losses of economic\nconfidence or customer trust in us.\n\nEconomic and market developments may affect\nconsumer and business confidence levels. If\ncustomers lose confidence due to concerns\nregarding the economy, the demand for our\nproducts and services could suffer. If we fail\nto attract and retain customers, demand for\nour loans and other financial products and\nservices could decrease, and we could\nexperience adverse changes in payment\npatterns. We could lose interest income from a\ndecline in credit usage and noninterest income\nfrom a decline in product sales, investments\nand other transactions.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customer\ndeposits is impacted by the levels of interest\nrates, as customers balance the benefits of\nbank accounts such as deposit insurance and\nsome of the convenience associated with more\ntraditional banking products against the\npossibility of higher yields from other\ninvestments. In general, if the spread between\nthe rates we offer and those offered by\nalternatives to bank accounts widens,\ncustomers are often willing to forego the\nbenefits of bank accounts (such as FDIC\ninsurance) for higher returns elsewhere. Our\ncustomers could remove money from checking,\nsavings or other types of deposit accounts\nwith us in favor of other banks or other types\nof cash management products. In such\ncircumstances, we would need either to\nincrease rates to levels that are seen as\ncompetitive or lose customers, in either case\nwith a negative impact to net interest income.\nIn addition, deposits are a low-cost source of\nfunds for us. Therefore, losing deposits could\nincrease our funding costs and reduce our net\ninterest income. Loss of customers could also\nharm noninterest income by decreasing fee-\nbearing transaction volume. In addition, when\nrates are higher, customers tend to shift\ndeposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to\ninterest-bearing ones, thereby negatively\nimpacting net interest income.\n\nOur customers increasingly use third-party\nfinancial applications that are expected to\ninterface with their PNC accounts. This use\nleads to the risk that issues with respect to\nthe effective functioning of that interface,\nregardless of cause, could result in a loss of\ncustomers as they seek banking relationships\nthat work better with these other\napplications.\n\nNews or other publicity that harms our\nreputation, or harms the reputation of our\nindustry generally, also could cause a loss of\ncustomers or a reduction in the extent to\nwhich customers do business with us. This is\ndescribed further in the Risk Factor headed\n\u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\u201d\n\nIn our asset management business, investment\nperformance is an important factor influencing\nthe level of assets that we manage. Poor\ninvestment advice or performance could hurt\nrevenue and growth as existing clients might\nwithdraw funds in favor of better performing\nproducts. Additionally, the ability to attract\nfunds from existing and new clients might\ndiminish. Overall economic conditions may\nlimit the amount that customers are able or\nwilling to invest as well as the value of the\nassets they do invest. The failure or negative\nperformance of products of other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a loss of\nconfidence in similar products offered by us\nwithout regard to the performance of our\nproducts. Such a negative contagion could lead\nto withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity\nissues in such products and have an adverse\nimpact on our assets under management and\nasset management revenues and earnings.\n\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\n\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract\nand retain customers and employees, and to\ngrow our business is dependent on maintaining\nour reputation and having the trust of our\ncustomers, employees, the communities that we\nserve and other stakeholders. Many types of\ndevelopments, if publicized, can negatively\nimpact a company\u2019s reputation with adverse\nconsequences to its business.\n\nFinancial services companies are highly\nvulnerable to reputational damage when they\nare found to have harmed customers,\nparticularly retail customers, through conduct\nthat is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive,\nabusive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful.\nThere also may be reputational damage from\nhuman error or systems failures viewed as\nhaving harmed customers without involving\nmisconduct, including service disruptions or\nnegative perceptions regarding our ability to\nmaintain the security of our technology\nsystems and protect client data. For example,\nwe may suffer reputational harm to the extent\nthat we are unable to successfully detect,\nprevent and remedy fraud that harms our\nclients. Our reputation may also be harmed by\nfailing to deliver products and services of\nthe quality expected by our customers and\nsupport the communities that we serve. In\naddition, our reputation may be harmed as a\nresult of our participation in certain\nprograms, such as the PPP and the processing\nof unemployment benefits during the COVID-19\npandemic, that has exposed and may continue to\nexpose us to increased scrutiny and criticism.\nThe reputational impact is likely greater to\nthe extent that the bad conduct, errors or\nfailures are pervasive, long-standing or\naffect a significant number of customers,\nparticularly retail consumers. The negative\nimpact of such reputational damage on our\nbusiness may be disproportionate to the actual\nharm caused to customers. It may be severe\neven if we fully remediate any harm suffered\nby our customers. Furthermore, because we\nconduct most of our businesses under the \u201cPNC\u201d\nbrand, negative public opinion about one\nbusiness could also affect our other\nbusinesses. In addition, we could suffer\nreputational harm and a loss of customer trust\nas a result of the conduct of others in our\nindustry even if we have not engaged in such\nconduct. We use third parties to help in many\naspects of our business, with the risk that\ntheir conduct can affect our reputation\nregardless of the degree to which we are\nresponsible for it.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 27\nTo an increasing extent, financial services\ncompanies, including PNC, are facing criticism\nwith accompanying reputational risk from\nsocial and environmental activists, and from\ninvestors and other stakeholders who believe\ncompanies should be focusing more or less on\nenvironmental, social and governance matters.\nCompanies in our industry, including PNC, are\ntargeted for engaging in business with\nspecific customers or with customers in\nparticular industries, where the customers\u2019\nactivities, even if legal, are perceived as\nhaving harmful impacts on matters such as the\nenvironment, consumer health and safety, or\nsociety at large. In addition, activists,\ninvestors and other stakeholders of companies\nin our industry, including PNC, are seeking\nincreased transparency and action with respect\nto environmental, social and governance\nactivities, political activities and\nactivities that are or may be perceived to be\npolitically partisan in nature. Criticism has\ncome in many forms, including protests at PNC\nfacilities and social media campaigns. PNC and\nmany other financial services companies have\nin recent years been criticized for financing\ncompanies engaged in, for example, extraction\nand distribution of fossil fuels, manufacture\nof nuclear and other weapons (including\npersonal firearms), private prisons and border\ncontrol activities. In contrast, state laws\naffecting our industry have been proposed and,\nin some cases, enacted reflecting opposite\napproaches. For example, to conduct most\nbusiness with a municipality in Texas, PNC\nmust certify, among other things, that it does\nnot discriminate against the firearms industry\nor the fossil fuel industry. Many of these\nissues are divisive without broad agreement as\nto the appropriate steps a company such as PNC\nshould take. As a result, however we respond\nto such criticism, we expose ourselves to the\nrisks that current or potential customers\ndecline to do business with us or current or\npotential employees refuse to work for us.\nThis can be true regardless of whether we are\nperceived by some as not having done enough to\naddress these concerns or by others as having\ninappropriately yielded to these pressures.\nThese pressures can also be a factor in\ndecisions as to which business opportunities\nand customers we pursue, potentially resulting\nin foregone profit opportunities.\n\nThe speed with which information moves through\nsocial media and other news sources on the\ninternet means that negative information about\nPNC can rapidly have a broadly adverse impact\non our reputation. This is true whether or not\nthe information is accurate. False information\ncan also be spread from unaffiliated or parody\nsocial media accounts pretending to be\nofficial company communications channels. Once\ninformation has gone viral, it can be\ndifficult to counter it effectively, either by\ncorrecting inaccuracies or communicating\nremedial steps taken for actual issues. The\npotential impact of negative information going\nviral means that material reputational harm\ncan result from a single discrete or isolated\nincident.\n\nWe are also subject to the risk of\nreputational harm resulting from conduct of\npersons identified as our employees but acting\noutside of the scope of their employment,\nincluding through their misconduct, unethical\nbehavior, or activities on personal social\nmedia.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nin terms of the products and services we offer\nand the geographic markets in which we conduct\nbusiness.\n\nWe are subject to intense competition both\nfrom other financial institutions and from\nnon-bank entities, including financial\ntechnology companies (often referred to as\n\u201cFinTech\u201d). In many cases, non-bank entities\ncan engage in many activities similar to ours\nor offer products and services desirable to\nour customers without being subject to the\nsame types of regulation, supervision and\nrestrictions that are applicable to banks,\nwhich could place us at a competitive\ndisadvantage. Emerging financial technologies,\nincluding with respect to payment services and\nsystems, lending, digital wallets, non-\nfungible tokens and digital currencies and\ncryptocurrencies, may affect our customers\u2019\nneeds and expectations for products and\nservices. We may fail to attract or retain\ncustomers if we are unable to develop and\nmarket products and services that meet\nevolving customer needs or demands or if we\nare unable to deliver them effectively and\nsecurely to our customers. We may also fail to\nattract or retain customers if we are\nunwilling to provide products or services that\nwe deem to be speculative or risky. The\ncompetition we face is described in Item 1 of\nthis Report under \u201cCompetition.\u201d\n\nConsolidation in our industry, including among\nsmaller banks combining to form more\ncompetitive larger ones and between banks and\nnon-bank entities, could result in PNC facing\nmore intense competition, particularly in\nimpacted regions or with respect to particular\nproducts. As we expand into new markets, we\nmay face competitors with more experience and\nestablished relationships in these markets,\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to\ncompete.\n\nA failure to adequately address the\ncompetitive pressures we face could make it\nharder for us to attract and retain customers\nacross our businesses. On the other hand,\nmeeting these competitive pressures could\nrequire us to incur significant additional\nexpense or to accept risk beyond what we would\notherwise view as desirable under the\ncircumstances. In addition, in our interest\nrate sensitive businesses, competitive\npressures to increase rates on deposits or\ndecrease rates on loans could reduce our net\ninterest margin, negatively impacting our net\ninterest income.\n\nWe depend on skilled labor, and employee\nattrition, competition for talented employees\nand labor shortages may have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operations.\n\nOur performance is dependent on attracting and\nretaining talented and diverse employees. We\nface significant competition for these\nemployees across many of our businesses and\nsupport areas. This presents greater risk as\nwe expand into new markets, develop new\nproduct lines, or enhance staffing in certain\nareas, particularly technology. This\ncompetition leads to increased expenses in\naffected business areas. In addition, changes\nto the labor market as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (including elevated employee\nattrition, labor availability and wage\ninflation) have exacerbated and may continue\nto exacerbate the challenges of attracting and\nretaining talented and diverse employees.\nDifferences in demands, expectations and\npriorities of the workforce (such as remote\nwork expectations) may require us to modify\nour recruiting and retention strategies to\nattract and retain employees. Limitations on\nthe way regulated financial institutions can\ncompensate their officers and employees,\nincluding those contained in pending rule\nproposals implementing requirements of Dodd-\nFrank, may make it more difficult for\nregulated financial institutions, including\nPNC, to compete with unregulated companies for\ntalent.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Other Operational Issues   \n                                              \nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity\nof employees, and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible, to manage\noperational risks.\n\nWe are a large company that offers a wide\nvariety of products and services to a broad\nand diverse group of customers. We rely on our\nemployees to design, manage and operate our\nsystems and controls to assure that we\nproperly enter into, record and manage\nprocesses, transactions and other\nrelationships with customers, suppliers and\nother parties with whom we do business. In\nsome cases, we rely on employees of third\nparties to perform these tasks. We also depend\non employees and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible to assure that we\nidentify and mitigate the risks that are\ninherent in our relationships and activities.\nThese concerns are increased when we change\nprocesses or procedures, introduce new\nproducts or services, acquire or invest in a\nbusiness or implement new technologies, as we\nmay fail to adequately identify or manage\noperational risks resulting from such changes.\nThese concerns may be further exacerbated by\nemployee turnover and labor shortages.\n\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on\nemployees, whether ours or those of third\nparties, to perform these tasks and manage\nresulting risks, we are thus subject to human\nvulnerabilities. These range from innocent\nhuman error to misconduct or malfeasance,\npotentially leading to operational breakdowns\nor other failures. Our controls may not be\nadequate to prevent problems resulting from\nhuman involvement in our business, including\nrisks associated with the design, operation\nand monitoring of automated systems. We may\nalso fail to adequately develop a culture of\nrisk management among our employees.\n\nErrors by our employees or others responsible\nfor systems and controls on which we depend\nand any resulting failures of those systems\nand controls to prevent unethical, fraudulent,\nimproper or illegal conduct could result in\nsignificant harm to PNC. This harm could\ninclude customer remediation costs, regulatory\nfines or penalties, litigation or enforcement\nactions or limitations on our business\nactivities. We could also suffer damage to our\nreputation, as described under \u201cWe are at risk\nfor an adverse impact on our business due to\ndamage to our reputation.\u201d\n\nWe use automation, machine learning,\nartificial intelligence and robotic process\nautomation tools to help reduce some risks of\nhuman error. Nonetheless, we continue to rely\non many manual processes to conduct our\nbusiness and manage our risks. In addition,\nuse of automation tools does not eliminate the\nneed for effective design and monitoring of\ntheir operation to make sure they operate as\nintended. Enhanced use of automation may\npresent its own risks. Automated systems may\nthemselves experience outages or problems.\nSome tools are dependent on the quality of the\ndata used by the tool to learn and enhance the\nprocess for which it is responsible. Not only\nbad or missing data but also anomalous data\ncan adversely affect the functioning of such\ntools. It is possible that humans in some\ncases are better able than highly automated\ntools to identify that anomalous data is being\nused or that results are themselves anomalous.\n\nWe rely on third-party vendors, service\nproviders and other counterparties to help\nsupport many aspects of our business. When we\ndo so, our direct control of activities\nrelated to our business is reduced, which\ncould introduce risk.\n\nOur use of third parties to support our\nbusiness needs typically means that we do not\ndirectly control the activities we are having\nthem perform. Any disruption in services\nprovided by these third parties could\nadversely affect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. Replacing third parties could also\nentail significant delay and expense. Risks\ncan arise through inadequate performance by a\nthird party (including by its downstream\nservice providers), specifically where that\nperformance could affect us or our customers,\nand even when the result of factors or events\nare beyond such third party\u2019s control. Many of\nthe kinds of risks presented by activities\nperformed by third parties are described\nelsewhere in these Risk Factors. For example,\nwe use outside companies to assist us in\nprocessing some confidential customer or\nemployee information. In such a case, a cyber\nattack on such a company may result in access\nto our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information.\nWe are also vulnerable, including to\nregulatory penalties, if an outside company\nfails to comply with legal requirements\nrelevant to its work on our behalf. We may in\nany such circumstance suffer financial losses,\nlegal consequences and injury to our\nreputation. Even if the other company makes us\nwhole for financial losses, which is not\nnecessarily the case, it is unlikely that it\nwould be able to restore any injury to our\nreputation. As a result, the use of third\nparties to assist in our business activities\nheightens the risks to us inherent in those\nactivities.\n                                              \n  Other Key Risks                             \n                                              \nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse\nresults in legal proceedings.\n\nMany aspects of our business involve\nsubstantial risk of legal liability. We have\nbeen named or threatened to be named as\ndefendants in various lawsuits arising from\nour business activities. In addition, we are\nregularly the subject of governmental\ninvestigations and other forms of regulatory\ninquiry. We also are at risk when we have\nagreed to indemnify others for losses related\nto legal proceedings they face, such as in\nconnection with the sale of a business or\nassets by us. The results of these legal\nproceedings could lead to significant monetary\ndamages or penalties, restrictions on the way\nin which we conduct our business or\nreputational harm.\n\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal\nproceedings when information related to the\nloss contingencies represented by those\nmatters indicates both that a loss is probable\nand that the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we do not have accruals for all\nlegal proceedings where we face a risk of\nloss. In addition, due to the inherent\nsubjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of the outcome of legal\nproceedings, amounts accrued often do not\nrepresent the ultimate loss to us from the\nlegal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nultimate future losses may be higher, and\npossibly significantly so, than the amounts\naccrued for legal loss contingencies. We\ndiscuss further the unpredictability of legal\nproceedings and describe certain of our\npending legal proceedings in Note 21 Legal\nProceedings.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 29\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring\nother financial services businesses from time\nto time. Sometimes these are businesses with\ntechnologies or other assets valuable to us\neven if they do not themselves provide\nfinancial services to customers. These\nacquisitions present a number of risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransactions themselves and to the integration\nof the acquired businesses into PNC after\nclosing.\n\nAcquisitions of other companies or of\nfinancial assets and deposits and other\nliabilities present risks and uncertainties to\nus in addition to those presented by the\nnature of the business acquired. Many of the\nsame risks arise when we engage in strategic\npartnerships.\n\nSpecific factors that can affect the ultimate\nresults from acquisitions include, depending\non the nature of the business acquired, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Diligence risk: Our ability to analyze the\nrisks presented by prospective acquisitions,\nas well as our ability to prepare in advance\nof closing for integration, depends, in part,\non the information we can gather with respect\nto the business we are acquiring. We may not\nhave access to all of the information that\nwould be desirable. Our pre-acquisition review\nof the business also impacts our ability to\nprepare for and execute on the integration of\nan acquired business.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy of assumptions: We make certain\nassumptions related to an acquisition that may\nprove to be inaccurate. Anticipated benefits\n(such as cost savings from synergies or\nstrategic gains from being able to offer\nenhanced product sets) may take longer or\nrequire greater resources to achieve or may\nnot be achieved in their entirety.\nAcquisitions also may be substantially more\nexpensive or take longer to complete than\nanticipated. We may also incur unanticipated\ncosts in connection with the integration of an\nacquired business.\n\n\u2022 Regulatory approval: Completing attractive\nacquisition opportunities generally requires\nvarious governmental and regulatory approvals\nand consents prior to closing. These\nauthorities have broad discretion, and\nregulatory approvals could be delayed,\nrestrictively conditioned or denied, including\ndue to regulatory issues we (or the target\ncompany) have, or may have, under any of the\nnumerous governmental regulations to which we\n(or it) are subject. Moreover, as a condition\nto approval, governmental authorities may\nimpose requirements, require divestitures or\nplace restrictions on the conduct of the\nbusiness of the combined company, which could\nlimit the benefits of the acquisition or\nresult in delay or the failure to close the\nacquisition. Significant acquisitions by large\nbanks also often attract public scrutiny,\nwhich may result in negative publicity that\nadversely affects our reputation. Our ability\nto make large acquisitions may be limited by\nthe regulatory agencies responsible for\nreviewing or approving the transaction,\nchanges in regulatory rules or standards or\nthe application of those rules or standards,\nor future regulatory initiatives designed to\nlimit systemic risk and the potential for a\nfinancial institution to become \u201ctoo big to\nfail.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Pre-closing risk: Prospective acquisition\ntargets are also subject to their own risks\nthat we cannot manage or control prior to\nclosing. As a result, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash\nflows could be adversely affected after\nclosing to the extent that any such risks\nresult in non-indemnified losses for which we\nare responsible.\n\n\u2022 Target-specific risk: Acquisition targets\nhave their own risks specific to their\nbusinesses that could impact the success of a\ntransaction.\n\n\u2022 If a significant aspect of the value of\ntransaction is intellectual property, the\nextent to which the intellectual property may\nbe utilized or protected and commercialized by\nPNC.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition includes loan portfolios,\nthe extent of actual credit losses and the\nrequired allowance for credit losses following\ncompletion of the acquisition.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition involves entering into\nnew businesses or geographic or other markets,\npotential limitations on our ability to take\nadvantage of these opportunities because of\nour inexperience with respect to them.\n\n\u2022 The results of litigation and governmental\ninvestigations that may be pending at the time\nof the acquisition or that may be filed or\ncommenced thereafter, because of an\nacquisition or otherwise. It is often hard to\npredict the results of such legal proceedings.\nIt may also be hard to anticipate what legal\nproceedings may be started following an\nacquisition based on the prior activities of\nthe acquired company (and its predecessors).\n\n\u2022 If the acquired company depends on models\nfor, among other things, capital planning and\ncredit loss accounting, we may have to rely on\nthe acquired company\u2019s models post-closing\nprior to integrating the acquired company\u2019s\ndata into PNC\u2019s models. These models may be\ndesigned or implemented in a manner different\nthan the models used by PNC. As a result,\nincorporation of the acquired company\u2019s data\ninto our models could materially impact our\nresults of operations or financial position to\nthe extent that our estimates based on the\nacquired company\u2019s models prove to be\ninaccurate.\n\n\u2022 The acquired company may operate under\nenterprise risk management systems, policies\nand procedures that are different and less\nmature than those of PNC, and we may need to\nrely on the acquired company\u2019s enterprise risk\nmanagement systems, policies and procedures\nfor a period of time after acquisition, which\nmight limit PNC\u2019s ability to identify,\nmonitor, manage and report risks. The acquired\ncompany may also implement its policies and\nprocedures in a different manner than PNC\nwould, which may result in heightened\nregulatory, legal, operational or reputational\nrisk.\n\n\u2022 Retention risk: The success of an\nacquisition generally is at least partially\ndependent on our ability to retain and expand\nupon the acquired company\u2019s customer base. It\nis also frequently subject to risks related to\nhuman capital, including, to the extent being\nretained, the quality of leadership of the\nacquired company.\n\n\u2022 Integration risk: Successful integration of\nan acquired company may present challenges due\nto differences in policies, procedures and\nsystems, the level of details or\ncomprehensiveness of an acquired company\u2019s\nfinancial and business information and data,\nand corporate culture. Integration challenges\ncould also result in damage to our reputation,\nas described under \u201cWe are at risk for an\nadverse impact on our business due to damage\nto our reputation.\u201d\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nOur business and financial performance could\nbe adversely affected, directly or indirectly,\nby disasters, natural or otherwise, by\nterrorist activities, by international\nhostilities or by domestic civil unrest.\n\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential\nimpact of natural and other disasters\n(including severe weather events), health\nemergencies, dislocations, geopolitical\ninstabilities, terrorist activities,\ninternational hostilities or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control can\nbe predicted. However, these occurrences could\nadversely impact us, for example, by causing\nsignificant damage to our facilities or\npreventing us from conducting our business in\nthe ordinary course. Also, their impact on our\nborrowers, depositors, other customers,\nsuppliers or other counterparties could result\nin indirect adverse effects on us. Other\nindirect adverse consequences from these\noccurrences could result from impacts to the\nfinancial markets, the economy in general or\nin any region, or key parts of the\ninfrastructure (such as the power grid) on\nwhich we and our customers rely. These types\nof indirect effects, whether specific to our\ncounterparties or more generally applicable,\ncould lead, for example, to an increase in\ndelinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that\ncould result in PNC experiencing higher levels\nof nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and\nprovisions for credit losses.

The increase was driven by higher\nnet interest income, partially offset by a\nhigher provision for credit losses, lower\nnoninterest income and higher expenses.\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $1.9 billion, or\n10%, to $21.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income increased $2.4 billion,\nor 22%, to $13.0 billion, primarily due to\nhigher interest-earning asset yields and\nbalances, partially offset by higher funding\ncosts.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased to 2.65% for\n2022 compared to 2.29% for 2021, due to higher\ninterest-earning asset yields, partially\noffset by higher funding rates.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $458 million,\nor 5%, to $8.1 billion, primarily due to lower\ncapital markets and advisory income, a\ndecrease in private equity revenue and lower\nresidential and commercial mortgage fees,\npartially offset by an increase in card and\ncash management revenue.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses was $477 million\nin 2022, driven by our weakened economic\noutlook along with loan growth, partially\noffset by the impacts from the reassessment of\npandemic-related risks and credit quality\nimprovement in the portfolio. Provision\nrecapture was $779 million for 2021.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $168 million\nto $13.2 billion, reflecting the addition of a\nfull year of BBVA operating expenses and\ncontinued business investment.

The\ndecrease was primarily driven by the\nreassessment of pandemic-related risks and\nimprovements in credit quality, partially\noffset by our weakened economic outlook along\nwith loan growth.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs of $563 million or 0.18% of\naverage loans in 2022 decreased 14% compared\nto net charge-offs of $657 million or 0.24% of\naverage loans for 2021. The decline was\nprimarily driven by fewer commercial net\ncharge-offs, partially offset by higher\nconsumer net charge-offs due to a decrease in\nrecoveries.

The decline was also\nattributable to share repurchases and common\ndividends paid.\n\n\u2022 In 2022, we returned $6.0 billion of capital\nto shareholders through dividends on common\nshares of $2.4 billion and repurchases of 21.2\nmillion common shares for $3.6 billion.\n\n\u25e6 The SCB framework allows for capital returns\nin amounts up to the level of capital in\nexcess of the firm\u2019s SCB plus the regulatory\nminimum level of capital. Consistent with the\nflexibility provided under the SCB framework,\nour Board of Directors has authorized a\nrepurchase framework under the repurchase\nprogram approved on April 4, 2019 of up to 100\nmillion common shares, of which approximately\n49% were still available for repurchase at\nDecember 31, 2022. Under this framework, PNC\nexpects quarterly repurchases of up to $500\nmillion with the ability to adjust those\nlevels as conditions warrant. PNC\u2019s SCB for\nthe four-quarter period beginning October 1,\n2022 is 2.9%.\n\n\u2022 On January 4, 2023, the PNC Board of\nDirectors declared a quarterly cash dividend\non common stock of $1.50 per share.

CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital is defined as the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. The CET1 fully implemented ratio, which\nreflects the full impact of CECL and excludes\nthe benefits of the optional five-year\ntransition, was 8.9% at December 31, 2022\ncompared to 10.0% at December 31, 2021.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a SCB\nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board in\nconnection with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nCCAR process.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 The economy continues to expand in early\n2023, but economic growth is slowing in\nresponse to the ongoing Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy tightening to slow inflation.\nThis has led to large increases in both short-\nand long-term interest rates. With much higher\nmortgage rates the housing market is already\nin contraction, with steep drops in existing\nhome sales and single-family housing starts,\nand a modest decline in house prices. Other\nsectors where interest rates play an outsized\nrole, such as business investment and consumer\nspending on durable goods, will contract in\n2023.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s baseline outlook is for a recession\nstarting in the second half of 2023, with real\nGDP contracting a modest 1% before recovery\nstarts in early 2024 as the Federal Reserve\nlowers interest rates in response to a\ndeteriorating labor market and slower\ninflation. The unemployment rate will increase\nthroughout 2023, peaking at above 5% in the\nfirst half of 2024. Inflation will slow with\nthe recession and be back to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective by early\n2024.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to increase the federal\nfunds rate by an additional 25 basis points in\nMarch. This would bring the federal funds rate\nto a range of 4.75% to 5.00% by mid-March. PNC\nexpects a federal funds rate cut of 25 basis\npoints in early 2024 as inflation moves toward\nthe FOMC\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\nSee Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation section in this Item 7 for other\nfactors that could cause future events to\ndiffer, perhaps materially, from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements.\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nFor the full year 2023, compared to full year\n2022, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be up 2% to 4%,\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up 6% to 8%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up 6% to 8%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be up 2% to 4%, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n18%.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2022, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be down 3% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, excluding net\nsecurities gains and Visa activity, to be\nbetween $200 million and $250 million,\n\n\u2022 Total revenue to decline approximately 3%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be down 2% to 4%, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be approximately\n$200 million.\n\nAdditionally, as of year-end 2022, we have\ncompleted all actions associated with the\nintegration of BBVA, and no additional\nintegration costs are anticipated.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest\nAnalysis and Analysis Of Year-To-Year Changes\nIn Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n\nNet interest income increased $2.4 billion, or\n22% in 2022 compared with 2021. The increase\nwas primarily due to higher interest-earning\nasset yields and balances, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs.

In comparison to December\n31, 2021:\n\n\u2022 Total assets were stable as higher loans,\nsecurities and MSRs were offset by lower\nbalances held with the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased primarily due to\nhigher borrowed funds, partially offset by a\ndecrease in deposits.\n\n\u2022 Total equity decreased as the benefits from\nnet income and preferred stock issuances were\nmore than offset by a decrease in AOCI,\nreflecting the negative impact of higher\ninterest rates on securities and swap values.\nThe decline was also attributable to common\nshare repurchases, dividends paid and the\nredemption of preferred stock.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion\nat December 31, 2022, a decrease of $0.1\nbillion since December 31, 2021. The\n\ndecrease was primarily driven by the\nreassessment of pandemic-related risks and\nimprovements in credit quality, partially\noffset by our weakened economic outlook along\nwith loan growth.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nregarding our ACL related to loans:\n\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Item 7,\n\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nsection of this Item 7, and\n\n\u2022 Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans\nand Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\n\nThe following discussion provides additional\ninformation about the major components of our\nbalance sheet.

We changed our\nintent and committed to hold these high-\nquality securities to maturity in order to\nreduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI\nand tangible capital.

The increase in\nearnings was attributable to higher net\ninterest income and noninterest income,\npartially offset by increased noninterest\nexpense and a higher provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nNet interest income increased primarily due to\ngrowth in average deposits and loan balances,\nreflecting the full-year benefit of BBVA\nacquisition, along with wider interest rate\nspreads on the value of deposits, partially\noffset by narrower interest rate spreads on\nthe value of loans.\n\nNoninterest income included the full-year\nimpact of the BBVA acquisition and increased\ndue to the favorable impact of Visa Class B\nderivative fair value adjustments, higher\nbrokerage fees reflecting favorable annuity\nactivity, growth in card and cash management\nrevenue driven by increased credit and debit\ncard activity, and higher lending and deposit\nrelated fees driven by increased service\ncharges on deposits. The increase in\nnoninterest income was partially offset by\ndeclines in residential mortgage revenue,\ndriven by lower loan sales revenue reflecting\nthe higher interest rate environment.\n\n50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nProvision for credit losses was driven by our\nweakened economic outlook, partially offset by\nthe impacts from the reassessment of pandemic-\nrelated risks and credit quality improvement\nin the portfolio.\n\nNoninterest expense increased due to the full-\nyear impact of BBVA operating expenses,\nincreased business activity and continued\ninvestments to support business growth.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In\n2022, average total deposits increased\ncompared to 2021 primarily driven by growth in\ndemand and savings deposits, which benefited\nfrom the full-year impact of the BBVA\nacquisition.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin 2022 compared to 2021. Average consumer\nloans increased 12% due to the full-year\nimpact of the BBVA acquisition on all loan\nclasses except education loans, which BBVA did\nnot have in its loan portfolio, partially\noffset by a decline in auto and other consumer\nloans as paydowns outpaced new originations.\nIn addition, average residential real estate\nloans increased, as new originations outpaced\nrunoff. Average commercial loans decreased\nprimarily due to PPP loans.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe have established a coast-to-coast network\nof retail branches, solution centers and ATMs\nthat operate alongside PNC\u2019s suite of digital\ncapabilities. Over time, we plan to continue\nto convert a portion of branches into solution\ncenters, which have a distinctive layout and\nthe capability to support transactions, sales\nand advice, using a combination of technology\nand personalized banker assistance. PNC began\nto deploy solution centers in 2018.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking, payments and investment\nproducts. In 2021, we successfully rolled out\nLow Cash Mode \u00ae to all Virtual Wallet \u00ae\ncustomers, providing them with the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime alerts, extra time to prevent or address\noverdrafts and controls to choose whether to\nreturn certain debits rather than the bank\nmaking the decision. In 2022, we continued to\nmake product benefit enhancements, such as by\neliminating non-sufficient fund fees for all\nconsumer checking account customers. Virtual\nWallet \u00ae customers had previously received\nthis benefit with the launch of Low Cash Mode\n\u00ae .\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand, as a result, we had a net closure of 111\nbranches in 2022, consistent with our plan.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 51\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

Average loans for\nthis business increased, driven by strong new\nproduction and higher average utilization of\nloan commitments as well as the full-year\nbenefit of loans from BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased, primarily\ndriven by higher utilization of loan\ncommitments and new production.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing, and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting new\nproduction, partially offset by lower average\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nproducts and services to smaller corporations\nand businesses. Average loans for this\nbusiness decreased, primarily driven by PPP\nloan forgiveness, partially offset by the\nfull-year benefit of loans from BBVA.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits decreased in the\ncomparison reflecting the impact of\ncompetitive pricing dynamics, partially offset\nby the full-year benefit of deposits from\nBBVA. We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nto our deposit strategy in response to\nevolving market conditions, bank funding needs\nand client relationship dynamics.\n\nIn 2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s geographic\nexpansion.

On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationship\nexists. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services.

Net interest income primarily\nincludes revenue from all treasury management\ncustomer deposit balances. Compared with 2021,\ntreasury management revenue increased due to\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits and higher noninterest income,\nreflecting the impact of customer growth and\nthe full-year benefit of BBVA.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 53\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\n\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\n\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower commercial mortgage\nservicing income and commercial mortgage loans\nheld for sale, partially offset by a higher\nbenefit from commercial mortgage servicing\nrights valuation, net of economic hedge.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading.

This business seeks to deliver high\nquality banking, trust, and investment\nmanagement services to our emerging affluent,\nhigh net worth, and ultra-high net worth\nclients through a broad array of products and\nservices.\n\nInstitutional Asset Management provides\noutsourced chief investment officer, custody,\nprivate real estate, cash and fixed income\nclient solutions, and retirement plan\nfiduciary investment services to institutional\nclients, including corporations, healthcare\nsystems, insurance companies, unions,\nmunicipalities and non-profits.\n\nWith the inclusion of BBVA, PNC Private Bank\nhas approximately 100 offices operating in\nnine of the ten most affluent states in the\nU.S. with a majority co-located within retail\nbanking branches.\n\nAsset Management Group earnings decreased $76\nmillion in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by\nan increase in noninterest expense, lower\nnoninterest income and a higher provision for\ncredit losses, partially offset by higher net\ninterest income.\n\nNet interest income increased due to growth in\naverage loan and deposit balances, reflecting\nthe full-year benefit of the BBVA acquisition\nand organic growth, as well as wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits. This\nwas partially offset by narrower interest rate\nspreads on the value of loans.\n\nNoninterest income decreased in the comparison\nprimarily attributable to lower average equity\nmarkets.\n\nNoninterest expense increased due to the full-\nyear impact of BBVA operations and continued\ninvestments to support business growth.\n\nDiscretionary client assets under management\ndecreased in comparison to the prior year\nprimarily attributable to lower equity markets\nas of December 31, 2022.\n                                              \n   R                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ISK                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n   M                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ANAGEMENT                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n   Enterprise Risk Management                 \n                                              \nWe encounter risk as part of the normal course\nof operating our business. Accordingly, we\ndesign our risk governance framework, referred\nto as the ERM Framework, and risk management\nprocesses to help manage this risk. We manage\nrisk in light of our risk appetite to optimize\nlong-term shareholder value while supporting\nour employees, customers and communities.\n\nOur ERM Framework is structurally aligned with\nregulatory enhanced prudential standards and\nheightened standards promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve and OCC, respectively, which\nestablish minimum requirements for the design\nand implementation of a risk governance\nframework. This Risk Management section\ndescribes our ERM Framework, which consists of\nseven core components that provide executive\nmanagement and the Board of Directors with an\naggregate view of significant risks impacting\nthe organization. The seven core components\nare risk culture, enterprise strategy\n(including risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing), risk\ngovernance and oversight, risk identification,\nrisk assessments, risk controls and\nmonitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting\n(see the figure below). The overall Risk\nManagement section of this Item 7 also\nprovides an analysis of the firm\u2019s Capital\nManagement and our key areas of risk, which\ninclude, but are not limited to Credit,\nMarket, Liquidity and Operational (including\nCompliance and Information Security). Our use\nof financial derivatives as part of our\noverall asset and liability risk management\nprocess is also addressed within this Risk\nManagement section.\n\nWe operate within a rapidly evolving\nregulatory environment. Accordingly, we are\nactively focused on the timely incorporation\nof applicable regulatory pronouncements into\nour ERM Framework.\n\n56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Risk Culture                                \n                                              \nA strong risk culture helps us make well\ninformed decisions, helps ensure individuals\nconform to the established culture, reduces an\nindividual\u2019s ability to do something for\npersonal gain, and rewards employees for\nworking toward a common goal rather than\nindividual interests. Our risk culture\nreinforces the appropriate protocols for\nresponsible and ethical behavior. These\nprotocols are especially critical in terms of\nour risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and\nrisk management practices.\n\nManaging risk is every employee\u2019s\nresponsibility. All of our employees,\nindividually and collectively, are responsible\nfor ensuring the organization is performing\nwith the utmost integrity, is applying sound\nrisk management practices and is striving to\nachieve our stated objectives. All employees\nare also responsible for understanding our\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM\nFramework and how risk management applies to\ntheir respective roles and responsibilities.\nEmployees are encouraged to collaborate across\ngroups to identify and mitigate risks and\nelevate issues as required. We reinforce risk\nmanagement responsibilities through a\nperformance management system where employee\nperformance goals include risk management\nobjectives and incentives for employees to\nreinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted\nperformance.\n\nProactive and open communication, between\ngroups and up to the Board of Directors,\nfacilitates timely identification and\nresolution of risk issues. Our multi-level\nrisk committee structure provides formal\nchannels to identify and report risk.\n                                              \n  Enterprise Strategy                         \n                                              \nWe seek to ensure that our overall enterprise\nstrategy is within acceptable risk parameters\nthrough our risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing processes.\nThese components are reviewed and approved at\nleast annually by the Board of Directors or\none of its committees.\n\nRisk Appetite : Our risk appetite represents\nthe organization\u2019s desired enterprise risk\nposition, set within our capital-based risk\nand liquidity capacity to achieve our\nstrategic objectives and business plans. The\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement\nqualitatively describes the aggregate level of\nrisk we are willing to accept in order to\nexecute our business strategies. Qualitative\nguiding principles further define each of the\nrisks within our taxonomy to support the risk\nappetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and\nlimits, including forward-looking metrics,\nquantitatively measure whether we are\noperating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our\nrisk appetite metrics reflect material risks,\nalign with our established Risk Appetite\nFramework, balance risk and reward, leverage\nanalytics, and are adjusted to changes in the\nexternal and internal risk environments.\n\nStrategic Planning : Our enterprise and line\nof business strategic plans outline major\nobjectives, strategies and goals which are\nexpected to be achieved over the next five\nyears while seeking to ensure we remain\ncompliant with all capital, risk appetite and\nliquidity targets and guidelines. Our chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer\nlead the development of the corporate\nstrategic plan.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing : Capital\nplanning helps to ensure we are maintaining\nsafe and sound operations and viability. The\ncapital planning process and the resulting\ncapital plan evolve as our overall risks,\nactivities and risk management practices\nchange. Capital planning aligns with our\nstrategic planning process. Stress testing is\nan essential element of the macroeconomics\ncapital planning process. Effective stress\ntesting enables us to consider the estimated\neffect on capital of various hypothetical\nscenarios.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance and Oversight               \n                                              \nWe employ a comprehensive risk management\ngovernance framework to help ensure that risks\nare identified, balanced decisions are made\nthat consider risk and return and risks are\nadequately monitored and managed. Risk\ncommittees established within this risk\ngovernance and oversight framework provide\noversight for risk management activities at\nthe Board of Directors, executive, corporate\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 57\nand business levels. Committee composition is\ndesigned to provide effective oversight\nbalanced across the three lines of defense in\naccordance with the OCC\u2019s heightened standards\nand the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s enhanced\nprudential standards. See the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report\nfor more information.\n\nTo ensure appropriate risks are being taken\nand effectively managed and controlled, risk\nis managed across three lines of defense. The\nBoard of Directors\u2019 and each line of defense\u2019s\nresponsibilities are detailed below:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 The Board of Directors\noversees our risk-taking activities, holds\nmanagement accountable for adhering to the ERM\nFramework and is responsible for exercising\nsound, independent judgment when assessing\nrisk.\n\nFirst line of defense \u2013 The front line units\nare accountable for identifying, owning and\nmanaging risks to within acceptable levels\nwhile adhering to the ERM Framework. Our\nbusinesses strive to enhance risk management\nand internal control processes within their\nareas. Integrated and comprehensive processes\nare designed to adequately manage the\nbusiness\u2019 risk profile and risk appetite\nthrough identifying, assessing, monitoring and\nreporting risks that may significantly impact\neach business.\n\nSecond line of defense \u2013 The second line of\ndefense is independent from the first line of\ndefense and is responsible for establishing\nthe risk governance framework and the\nstandards within each independent risk area\nfor identifying, measuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting aggregate risks. As\nthe second line of defense, the independent\nrisk areas monitor the risks generated by the\nfirst line of defense, review and challenge\nthe implementation of effective risk\nmanagement practices, and report on issues or\nexceptions. The risk areas help to ensure\nprocesses and controls owned by the businesses\nare designed and operating as intended .\n\nThird line of defense \u2013 As the third line of\ndefense, Internal Audit is independent from\nthe first and second lines of defense.\nInternal Audit provides the Board of Directors\nand executive management comprehensive\nassurance on the effectiveness of the ERM\nFramework and the risk management practices\nacross the organization.\n\nWithin the three lines of defense, the\nindependent risk organization has sufficient\nauthority to influence material decisions. Our\nbusiness oversight and decision-making is\nsupported through a governance structure at\nthe Board of Directors and management level.\nSpecific responsibilities include:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 Our Board of Directors\noversees our business and affairs as managed\nby our officers and employees. The Board of\nDirectors may receive assistance in carrying\nout its duties and may delegate authority\nthrough standing or special committees. The\nfollowing provides a summary of some of the\nkey responsibilities of the Board\u2019s standing\ncommittees:\n\n\u2022 Audit Committee : monitors the integrity of\nour consolidated financial statements;\nmonitors internal control over financial\nreporting; monitors compliance with our code\nof ethics; evaluates and monitors the\nqualifications and independence of our\nindependent auditors; and evaluates and\nmonitors the performance of our Internal Audit\nfunction and our independent auditors.\n\n\u2022 Nominating and Governance Committee :\noversees the implementation of sound corporate\ngovernance principles and practices while\npromoting our best interests and those of our\nshareholders.\n\n\u2022 Human Resources Committee : oversees the\ncompensation of our executive officers and\nother specified responsibilities related to\ntalent and human capital matters affecting us.\nThe committee is also responsible for\nevaluating the relationship between risk-\ntaking activities and incentive compensation\nplans.\n\n\u2022 Risk Committee : oversees our enterprise-\nwide risk structure and the processes\nestablished to identify, measure, monitor and\nmanage the organization\u2019s risks and evaluates\nand approves our risk governance framework.\nThe Risk Committee has formed a Compliance\nSubcommittee to facilitate Board-level\noversight of risk management in the compliance\narea.\n\n\u2022 Special Committee on Equity & Inclusion :\noversees management\u2019s equity and inclusion\nefforts, internally and externally, focusing\non our systemic processes (including for\nemployees and suppliers); low- and moderate-\nincome communities (including community\ndevelopment banking, and product offerings and\nfinancial support for such communities); and\nadvocacy (including partnerships with leading\norganizations, and advocacy for necessary\nstructural changes to help provide greater\naccess to the banking system and end systemic\nracism).\n\n\u2022 Technology Committee : oversees technology\nstrategy and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs, including those that\ncan position the use of technology to drive\nstrategic advantages, and fulfills the\noversight responsibilities delegated from the\nRisk Committee with respect to technology\nrisk, technology risk management,\ncybersecurity, information security, business\ncontinuity and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs.\n\nManagement Level Executive Committee \u2013 The\nManagement Level Executive Committee is\nresponsible for guiding the creation and\nexecution of our business strategy across the\ncompany. With this responsibility, the\nManagement Level Executive Committee executes\nvarious strategic approval and review\nactivities, with a focus on capital\ndeployment, business performance and risk\nmanagement. This Committee also helps ensure\nPNC is staffed with sufficient resources and\ntalent to operate within its risk appetite.\n\nCorporate Committees \u2013 The Corporate\nCommittees generally operate based on the\ndelegated approval authority from a Board-\nlevel Committee, the Management Level\nExecutive Committee or other Corporate\nCommittees. These Committees operate at the\n\n58 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nsenior management level and are designed to\nfacilitate the review, evaluation, oversight\nand approval of key business and risk\nactivities.\n\nWorking Committees \u2013 Working Committees\ngenerally operate on delegated approval\nauthority from a Corporate Committee or other\nWorking Committees. Working Committees are\nintended to provide oversight of\nregulatory/legal matters, assist in the\nimplementation of key enterprise-level\nactivities within a business or function and\nsupport the oversight of key risk activities.\n\nTransactional Committees \u2013 Transactional\nCommittees generally operate based on\ndelegated approval authority from a Corporate\nor Working Committee to approve individual\ntransactions, transactional related activities\nor movements on the organization\u2019s balance\nsheet.\n\nPolicies and Procedures \u2013 We have established\nrisk management Policies and Procedures to\nsupport our ERM Framework, articulate our risk\nculture, define the parameters and processes\nwithin which employees are to manage risk and\nconduct our business activities and to provide\ndirection, guidance and clarity on roles and\nresponsibilities to management and the Board\nof Directors. These Policies and Procedures\nare organized in a multi-tiered framework and\nrequire periodic review and approval by\nrelevant Committees, including where\nappropriate Committees of the Board of\nDirectors, or management.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nRisk identification takes place across a\nvariety of risk types throughout the\norganization. These risk types include, but\nare not limited to, credit, liquidity and\ncapital, market and operational (which\nincludes, among other types of risk,\ncompliance and information security). Risks\nare identified based on a balanced use of\nanalytical tools and management judgment for\nboth on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our\ngovernance structure supports risk\nidentification by facilitating assessment of\nkey risk issues, emerging risks and\nidiosyncratic risks and implementation of\nmitigation strategies as appropriate. These\nrisks are prioritized based on quantitative\nand qualitative analysis and assessed against\nour risk appetite. Multiple tools and\napproaches are used to help identify and\nprioritize risks, including Risk Appetite\nMetrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance\nIndicators, Risk and Control Self-Assessments,\nscenario analysis, stress testing and special\ninvestigations.\n\nRisks are aggregated and assessed within and\nacross risk functions and businesses. The\naggregated risk information is reviewed and\nreported at an enterprise level to the Board\nof Directors or appropriate committees. This\nenterprise aggregation and reporting approach\npromotes the identification and appropriate\nescalation of material risks across the\norganization and supports an understanding of\nthe cumulative impact of risk in relation to\nour risk appetite.\n                                              \n  Risk Assessment                             \n                                              \nOnce risks are identified, they are evaluated\nbased on quantitative and qualitative analysis\nto determine whether they are material. Risk\nassessments support the overall management of\nan effective ERM Framework and help us to\ncontrol and monitor our actual risk level and\nrisk management effectiveness. Comprehensive,\naccurate and timely assessments of risk are\nessential to an effective ERM Framework.\nEffective risk measurement practices are\ndesigned to uncover recurring risks that have\nbeen experienced in the past; facilitate the\nmonitoring, understanding, analysis and\nreporting of known risks; and reveal\nunanticipated risks that may not be easy to\nunderstand or predict.\n                                              \n   Risk Controls and Monitoring               \n                                              \nOur ERM Framework consists of policies,\nprocesses, personnel and control systems. Risk\ncontrols and limits provide the linkage from\nour Risk Appetite Statement and associated\nguiding principles to the risk-taking\nactivities of our businesses. In addition to\nrisk appetite limits, a system of more\ndetailed internal controls exists which\noversees and monitors our various processes\nand functions. These control systems measure\nperformance, help employees make correct\ndecisions, help ensure information is accurate\nand reliable and facilitate compliance with\nlaws and regulations.\n\nWe design our monitoring and evaluation of\nrisks and controls to provide assurance that\npolicies, procedures and controls are\neffective and also to result in the\nidentification of control improvement\nrecommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily,\nongoing process used by both the first and\nsecond line of defense to help ensure\ncompliance with our ERM Framework. Risk\nmonitoring is accomplished in many ways,\nincluding performing risk assessments at the\nbusiness and risk assessment unit level,\nmonitoring an area\u2019s key controls, the timely\nreporting of issues and establishing a quality\ncontrol and/or quality assurance function, as\napplicable.\n                                              \n  Risk Aggregation and Reporting              \n                                              \nRisk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i)\ncommunicate aggregate risks, including\nidentified concentrations; (ii) escalate\ninstances where we are outside of our risk\nappetite; (iii) monitor our risk profile in\nrelation to our risk appetite; and (iv)\ncommunicate risks and views on the\neffectiveness of our risk management\nactivities to the Board of Directors and\nexecutive management.\n\nRisk reports are produced at the line of\nbusiness, functional risk and enterprise\nlevels. Each individual risk report includes\nan assessment of inherent risk, quality of\nrisk management, residual risk, risk appetite\nand risk outlook. The enterprise level risk\nreport aggregates material risks identified in\nthe risk area reports and in the business\nreports to define the enterprise risk profile.\nThe enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time\nassessment of enterprise risk and represents\nour overall risk position in relation to the\ndesired\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 59\nenterprise risk appetite. The determination of\nthe enterprise risk profile is based on\nanalysis of quantitative reporting of risk\nlimits and other measures along with\nqualitative assessments. Quarterly aggregation\nof risk reports from the risk areas and lines\nof business is designed to provide a clear\nview of our risk level relative to our\nquantitative risk appetite. The enterprise\nlevel report is provided through the\ngovernance structure to the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk Management                      \n                                              \nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with the contractual\nterms of their loan, extension of credit or\nother financial obligation with PNC. Credit\nrisk is inherent in the financial services\nbusiness and results from extending credit to\ncustomers, purchasing securities and entering\ninto financial derivative transactions and\ncertain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is\none of our most significant risks. Our\nprocesses for managing credit risk are\ndesigned to be embedded in our risk culture\nand in our decision-making processes using a\nsystematic approach whereby credit risks and\nrelated exposures are identified and assessed,\nmanaged through specific policies and\nprocesses, measured and evaluated against our\nrisk appetite and credit concentration limits,\nand reported, along with specific mitigation\nactivities, to management and the Board of\nDirectors through our governance structure.\nOur most significant concentration of credit\nrisk is in our loan portfolio.\n\nCredit Risk Management employs a governance,\npolicy and monitoring framework for\nenvironmental and social risk topics that may\ninclude updates to PNC\u2019s Credit Portfolio\nStrategy Committee. Outcomes from those\nupdates may be incorporated into credit\npolicies and risk procedures that govern our\nrisk appetite, credit decisioning, portfolio\nmanagement and reserve processes.\n\nCredit Risk Management is currently working to\nunderstand, and incorporate into our credit\nrisk management framework, the impacts to\ncredit risk that may accelerate or be\nintroduced as a result of climate change,\nincluding impacts from physical risk events\nand risks associated with the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy. These risk events may\nimpact a borrower\u2019s income, cash flow or\ncollateral due to frequency or severity of\nweather events, changing market conditions,\nconsumer preferences and demand for products,\nor changes to the legislative and regulatory\nlandscape. As disruptive events occur, PNC\nfollows a process to determine if enhanced\nportfolio monitoring, reporting and executive\ncommunication is warranted to ensure\nappropriate oversight and action.\n\nTo address environmental and social-related\nrisks, including climate change, PNC limits\nnew originations in sectors that are no longer\nconsistent with our strategic direction, such\nas mountain-top mining, Arctic oil and gas and\nprivate prisons. Corporate & Institutional\nBanking transactions may be subjected to an\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management\nassessment designed to help us better identify\nand mitigate environmental, human rights and\nother social risks early in the credit\napplication process. Transactions identified\nas having a potential environmental, human\nrights or other social risk are evaluated to\ndetermine whether enhanced due diligence is\nwarranted. Additionally, PNC strives to ensure\nflood insurance is present for properties as\nrequired by applicable regulations, while also\nmonitoring other water-related risks (such as\nthe increased shoreline (and coastal) erosion)\nand weather-related events (such as hurricanes\nand wildfires).\n                                              \n  Loan Portfolio Characteristics and          \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 15: Details of Loans                  \n                                              \nIn billions\n\n60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators, as\nfurther detailed in Note 4 Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and\nmeasure our exposure to credit risk within our\nloan portfolio.

Examples of this collateral\ninclude short-term assets, such as accounts\nreceivable, inventory and securities, and\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-\noccupied real estate and other business\nassets.\n\nWe actively manage our commercial and\nindustrial loans to assess any changes (both\npositive and negative) in the level of credit\nrisk at both the borrower and portfolio level.\nTo evaluate the level of credit risk, we\nassign internal risk ratings reflecting our\nestimates of the borrower\u2019s PD and LGD for\neach related credit facility. This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geographies that may exist in our\nportfolio. Our commercial and industrial\nportfolio is well-diversified across\nindustries as shown in the following table\nwhich provides a breakout by industry\nclassification (classified based on the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System).\n\nTable 16: Commercial and Industrial Loans by\nIndustry\n                                              \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  30\u2026     17  %    $  22\u2026     15  %  \n  R\u2026       29\u2026     16          22\u2026     15     \n  t\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       23\u2026     13          20\u2026     14     \n  p\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026       21\u2026     12          17\u2026     12     \n  s\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026       17\u2026     10          15\u2026     10     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       11\u2026      7          10\u2026      7     \n  &                                           \n  t\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       10\u2026      6          9,\u2026      7     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       7,\u2026      4          7,\u2026      5     \n  w\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       29\u2026     15          26\u2026     15     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $  18\u2026    100  %    $  15\u2026    100  %  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real\nestate and construction industries.\n\nCommercial and industrial loan growth from\nDecember 31, 2021 was driven by new production\nand higher utilization of loan commitments,\npartially offset by PPP loan forgiveness.

We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming).

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $40.6 billion at December 31,\n2022 with 44% located in California.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2021 were\n$34.9 billion and 42%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $19.5 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $6.5 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at December 31, 2022.\nComparable amounts were $15.8 billion and $8.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\ntrack borrower performance of this portfolio\non a monthly basis. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit or brokered\nhome equity lines of credit) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold such\nliens. This information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 63\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 19: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5,\u2026    19    %    $  5\u2026     21   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    13            3\u2026     13      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     9            2\u2026     10      \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     8            1\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            7\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       995     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6,\u2026    24            5\u2026     23      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  25\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              58    %              62   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              42                   38      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  774                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              67    %              66   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at December 31, 2022.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $13.7 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.1 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of December 31,\n2022.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower, repayment sources,\nunderlying collateral, and other support given\ncurrent events, economic conditions and\nexpectations. We refine our practices to meet\nthe changing environment resulting from rising\ninflation levels, supply chain disruptions,\nhigher interest rates and secular changes\nfostered by the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate\nlosses and enhance customer support, we have\ncustomer assistance, loan modification and\ncollection programs that align with the CARES\nAct and subsequent interagency guidance. As a\nresult, under the CARES Act credit reporting\nrules, certain loans modified due to COVID-19\nrelated hardships are not being reported as\npast due as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\naccruing loans past due by delinquency status:\n\nTable 23: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion\nand $0.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in accruing loans past due from\nDecember 31, 2021 was the result of lower\ndelinquencies in both the consumer and\ncommercial portfolios.\n\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\ncontinue to accrue interest because they are\n(i) well secured by collateral and are in the\nprocess of collection, (ii) managed in\nhomogeneous portfolios with specified charge-\noff timeframes adhering to regulatory\nguidelines, or (iii) certain government\ninsured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions ( e.g. , a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Prior to the expiration of TDR relief\non January 1, 2022, PNC elected not to apply a\nTDR designation to loans that were\nrestructured due to a COVID-19 hardship\npursuant to specific criteria under the CARES\nAct. Consistent with the expiration of this\nrelief, loans that experience a COVID-19\nrelated hardship and are restructured after\nJanuary 1, 2022 are subject to existing GAAP\nguidance related to TDRs.\n\n66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\ntroubled debt restructurings at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively:\n\nTable 24: Summary of Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (a)\n                                              \n              D\u2026           D\u2026                 \n              3\u2026           3\u2026                 \n              2\u2026           2\u2026       C\u2026        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $            %                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5\u2026        $  6\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026       8\u2026           9\u2026           -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  1\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  6\u2026        $  9\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026       7\u2026           6\u2026           1\u2026    1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  1\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table do not include associated\nvaluation allowances.\n\n(b) Accruing loans include consumer credit\ncard loans and certain loans that have\ndemonstrated a period of at least six months\nof performance under the restructured terms\nand are excluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nNonperforming TDRs represented approximately\n35% of total nonperforming loans and 50% of\ntotal TDRs at December 31, 2022.

Forward-looking\ninformation, such as forecasted relevant\nmacroeconomic variables, is incorporated into\nthe expected credit loss estimates using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, as well as\nthrough analysis from PNC\u2019s economists and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment in qualitatively\nassessing the ACL.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long-run average expected\ncredit losses. We may consider a number of\nfactors in determining the duration of the\nreversion period, such as contractual maturity\nof the asset, observed historical patterns and\nthe estimated credit loss rates at the end of\nthe forecast period relative to the beginning\nof the long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from our available historical\ncredit information. We use long-run average\nexpected loss for the portfolio over the\nestimated remaining contractual term beyond\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nand the reversion period.\n\nThe following discussion provides additional\ninformation related to our reserves under CECL\nfor loans and leases as well as unfunded\nlending related commitments. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies for further discussion on\nour ACL, including details of\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 67\nour methodologies and discussion of the\nallowances for investment securities and other\nfinancial assets. See also the Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments section for\nfurther discussion of the assumptions used in\nthe determination of the ACL.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is\nbased upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD\nand the remaining estimated contractual term\nfor a loan, loan segment or lease. We also\nconsider the impact of prepayments and\namortization on contractual maturity in our\nexpected loss estimates. We use historical\ndata, current borrower characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables in quantitative\nmethods to estimate these risk parameters by\nloan, loan segment or lease. PDs represent a\nquantification of risk that a borrower may not\nbe able to pay their contractual obligation\nover a defined period of time. LGD describes\nthe estimate of potential loss if a borrower\nwere to default, and EAD (or utilization rates\nfor revolving loans) is the estimated balance\noutstanding at the time of default. These\nparameters are calculated for each forecasted\nscenario and are combined to generate expected\nloss estimates by scenario in proportion to\nthe scenario weights.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology for\nour consumer real estate related loan classes\nand for certain TDR loans. For non-TDR\nresidential real estate loans and lines, we\ndetermine effective interest rates considering\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for\nprepayments and market interest rates. We then\ndetermine the net present value of expected\ncash flows and ALLL by discounting contractual\ncash flows adjusted for both prepayments and\nexpected credit losses using the effective\ninterest rates.\n\nFor loans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans, we\nestablish individually assessed reserves using\nmethods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for\nindividual commercial nonperforming loans and\ncommercial nonperforming TDRs exceeding a\ndefined dollar threshold are based on an\nanalysis of the present value of the loan\u2019s\nexpected future cash flows or the fair value\nof the collateral, if appropriate under our\npolicy for collateral dependent loans.\nCommercial nonperforming loans that are below\nthe defined threshold and accruing TDRs are\ncollectively reserved for, as we believe these\nloans continue to share similar risk\ncharacteristics. For consumer nonperforming\nloans classified as collateral dependent,\ncharge-off and ALLL related to recovery of\namounts previously charged-off are evaluated\nthrough an analysis of the fair value of the\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses attributable to such risks. A\nportion of the allowance is related to\nqualitative measurement factors. These factors\nmay include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable, ( e.g., unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees) at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. The allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments is recorded as a\nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNet adjustments to this reserve are included\nin the provision for credit losses.\n\n68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table summarizes our ACL related\nto loans:\n\nTable 25: Allowance for Credit Losses by Loan\nClass (a)\n

The decline\nwas primarily driven by fewer commercial net\ncharge-offs, partially offset by higher\nconsumer net charge-offs primarily due to a\ndecrease in recoveries. Net charge-offs in the\ncomparative period included BBVA-related\ncharge-offs resulting from required purchase\naccounting treatment.\n\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information.\n                                              \n  Liquidity and Capital Management            \n                                              \nLiquidity risk has two fundamental components.\nThe first is potential loss assuming we were\nunable to meet our funding requirements at a\nreasonable cost. The second is the potential\ninability to operate our businesses because\nadequate contingent liquidity is not\navailable. We manage liquidity risk at the\nconsolidated company level (bank, parent\ncompany and all subsidiaries combined) to help\nensure that we can obtain cost-effective\nfunding to meet current and future obligations\nunder both normal \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and\nstressful circumstances, and to help ensure\nthat we maintain an appropriate level of\ncontingent liquidity.\n\nManagement monitors liquidity through a series\nof early warning indicators that may indicate\na potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity\nstress event. In addition, management performs\na set of liquidity stress tests over multiple\ntime horizons with varying levels of severity\nand maintains a contingency funding plan to\naddress a potential liquidity stress event. In\nthe most severe liquidity stress simulation,\nwe assume that our liquidity position is under\npressure, while the market in general is under\nsystemic pressure. The simulation considers,\namong other things, the impact of restricted\naccess to both secured and unsecured external\nsources of funding, accelerated runoff of\ncustomer deposits, valuation pressure on\nassets and heavy demand to fund committed\nobligations. Parent company liquidity\nguidelines are designed to help ensure that\nsufficient liquidity is available to meet our\nparent company obligations over the succeeding\n24-month period. Liquidity-related risk limits\nare established within our Enterprise\nLiquidity Management Policy\n\n70 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nand supporting policies. Management\ncommittees, including the Asset and Liability\nCommittee, and the Board of Directors and its\nRisk Committee regularly review compliance\nwith key established limits.\n\nIn addition to these liquidity monitoring\nmeasures and tools described above, we also\nmonitor our liquidity by reference to the LCR,\nwhich is calculated on a daily basis, and the\nNSFR which are further described in the\nSupervision and Regulation section in Item 1\nBusiness of this Report.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of this Report.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits decreased to\n$436.3 billion at December 31, 2022 from\n$457.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and\nincluded a shift from noninterest-bearing to\ninterest-bearing deposits in 2022, reflecting\nthe impact of higher interest rates. See the\nFunding Sources section of the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review in this Item 7 for\nadditional information related to our\ndeposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our liquid assets\nconsisted of cash and due from banks and\nshort-term investments (federal funds sold,\nresale agreements, trading securities and\ninterest-earning deposits with banks) totaling\n$37.8 billion and securities available for\nsale totaling $44.2 billion. The level of\nliquid assets fluctuates over time based on\nmany factors, including market conditions,\nloan and deposit growth and balance sheet\nmanagement activities. PNC pledges securities\nas collateral to secure public and trust\ndeposits, repurchase agreements and for other\npurposes. Pledged securities included $25.3\nbillion of securities held to maturity and an\nimmaterial amount of available for sale and\ntrading securities.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings). See Note 10\nBorrowed Funds and the Funding Sources section\nof the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in\nthis Item 7 for additional information related\nto our borrowings.\n\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, decreased during 2022 due\nto the following activity:\n                                              \n  Table 27: Senior and Subordinated Debt      \n                                              \n                                         \n  In billions                      2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01               $  27.7        \n  Issuances                   4.5        \n  Calls and maturities       -7.3        \n  Other                      -1.9        \n  December\u00a031             $  23.0        \n                                         \n                                              \n  Bank Liquidity                              \n                                              \nUnder PNC Bank\u2019s 2014 bank note program, as\namended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer\nup to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount\noutstanding at any one time of its unsecured\nsenior and subordinated notes with maturity\ndates more than nine months (in the case of\nsenior notes) and five years or more (in the\ncase of subordinated notes) from their date of\nissue.

The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nDecember 31, 2022, our unused secured\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank totaled $67.2\nbillion.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of December 31, 2022,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may access funding from\nthe parent company through deposits placed at\nthe bank or through issuing senior unsecured\nnotes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $9.6 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $3.5 billion at December 31,\n2022. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters for\nfurther discussion of these limitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. As authorized by the Board\nof Directors, the parent company has the\nability to offer up to $5.0 billion of\ncommercial paper to provide additional\nliquidity. As of December 31, 2022, there were\nno commercial paper issuances outstanding.\n\n72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table details Parent Company\nnote

The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC\u2019s\nelection to adopt the CECL five-year\ntransition provisions. Effective for the first\nquarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the\nfull impact of CECL and excludes the benefits\nof the optional five-year transition.\n\n(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have\nelected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\n\n(d) Basel III standardized approach weighted-\nassets are based on the Basel III standardized\napproach rules and include credit and market\nrisk-weighted assets.\n\n(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account the quarterly average of both on\nbalance sheet assets as well as certain off-\nbalance sheet items, including loan\ncommitments and potential future exposure\nunder derivative contracts.\n\n(f) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. See additional discussion of this rule\nin the Supervision and Regulation section of\nItem 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors .\n\nAt December 31, 2022, PNC and PNC Bank were\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on\napplicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d, PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for CET1 risk-based\ncapital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10%\nfor Total risk-based capital and a Leverage\nratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples and believe that our December 31,\n2022 capital levels were aligned with them.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 75\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management                     \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk of a loss in earnings\nor economic value due to adverse movements in\nmarket factors such as interest rates, credit\nspreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity\nprices and equity prices. We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily by our involvement in\nthe following activities, among others:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans,\n\n\u2022 Fixed income securities, derivatives and\nforeign exchange activities, as a result of\ncustomer activities, securities underwriting\nand our investment portfolio, and\n\n\u2022 Other investments, including equity and\nactivities whose economic values are directly\nimpacted by market factors.\n\nWe have established enterprise-wide policies\nand methodologies to identify, measure,\nmonitor and report market risk. Market Risk\nManagement provides independent oversight by\nmonitoring compliance with established\nguidelines and reporting significant risks in\nthe business to management committees and,\nwhere appropriate, the Risk Committee of the\nBoard of Directors.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans.

Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our risk management policies,\nwhich are approved by management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2022 and\n2021 follow:\n                                              \n   Table 34: Interest Sensitivity Analysis    \n                                              \n                                              \n                   Fourth           Fourth    \n                   Quarter          Quarter   \n                   2022             2021      \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       1.2  %           3.7  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point      -1.4  %                N/A       \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       3.1  %           9.9  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point            (4)%             N/A       \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n                                              \n(a) Due to the prevailing low interest rate\nenvironment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nreporting of Net interest income sensitivities\nfor the 100 basis point decrease scenario was\nsuspended from the first quarter of 2020 to\nthe first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn addition to measuring the effect on net\ninterest income assuming parallel changes in\ncurrent interest rates, we routinely simulate\nthe effects of a number of nonparallel\ninterest rate environments.

PNC holds instruments and services its\ninstruments and instruments owned by others\nthat may be impacted by the likely cessation\nof LIBOR, including loans, investments,\nhedging products, floating-rate obligations\nand other financial instruments that use LIBOR\nas a reference rate. The transition from LIBOR\nas an interest rate benchmark will subject\nPNC, like other financial participants, to\nfinancial, legal, operational and reputational\nrisks.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, PNC has established a cross-\nfunctional governance structure to oversee the\noverall strategy for the transition from LIBOR\nand mitigate risks associated with the\ntransition.\n\nKey efforts to date have included:\n\n\u2022 Completion of LIBOR impact and risk\nassessments,\n\n\u2022 Enhancing fallback language in new contracts\nand reviewing existing legal\ncontracts/agreements to assess fallback\nlanguage impacts,\n\n\u2022 Preparing for internal operational\nreadiness,\n\n\u2022 Making necessary enhancements to PNC\u2019s\ninfrastructure, including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes,\n\n\u2022 Developing and delivering on internal and\nexternal LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n\n\u2022 Engaging with PNC clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators,\n\n\u2022 Monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments, and\n\n\u2022 Providing periodic regulator updates to the\nFederal Reserve, OCC and FDIC examination\nstaff regarding PNC\u2019s LIBOR cessation and\ntransition plans.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, PNC Bank ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate, except on a limited basis, as\npermissible. PNC is offering conforming\nadjustable-rate mortgages using SOFR instead\nof USD LIBOR, in line with Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac requirements, nonconforming\nadjustable-rate residential mortgages using\nSOFR and private education loans using Prime.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 77\nAlternative rates, primarily SOFR and BSBY,\nare currently offered to our corporate and\ncommercial customers. The focus for 2022 was\nplanning for the cessation event in 2023 for\nall lines of business. Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking continues its efforts of\namending contracts with inadequate fallback\nlanguage, working on systems enhancements, and\ncontinuing with client outreach and education.\n\nThe Federal Reserve adopted a final rule\neffective February 27, 2023 that implements\nthe Adjustable Interest Rate LIBOR Act (the\n\u201cAct\u201d) by identifying benchmark rates based on\nSOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain\nfinancial contracts after June 30, 2023. The\nfinal rule helps ensure that LIBOR contracts\nadopting a benchmark rate selected by the\nFederal Reserve will not be interrupted or\nterminated following LIBOR\u2019s replacement. The\nfinal rule identifies replacement benchmark\nrates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-\nmonth, three-month, six-month, and 12-month\nLIBOR contracts subject to the Act. These\ncontracts include U.S. contracts that do not\nmature before publication of LIBOR ends June\n30, 2023, and that lack adequate fallback\nprovisions that would replace LIBOR with a\npracticable replacement benchmark rate.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, PNC had approximately\n$60.6 billion in loans and securities and\n$332.9 billion notional value in derivatives\ntied to LIBOR that mature after June 30, 2023.\nPNC is actively working to address contracts\nwithout an alternative rate or sufficient\nfallbacks in advance of cessation; however,\nPNC does expect to leverage the LIBOR Act for\nits intended purpose, to address difficult\nexposures when necessary. We anticipate these\nexposures to be a small subset of our overall\nportfolio.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical correlations across different asset\nclasses. We calculate a diversified VaR at a\n95% confidence interval and the results for\n2022 and 2021 were within our acceptable\nlimits.\n\nTo help ensure the integrity of the models\nused to calculate VaR for each portfolio and\nenterprise-wide, we use a process known as\nbacktesting. The backtesting process consists\nof comparing actual observations of gains or\nlosses against the VaR levels that were\ncalculated at the close of the prior day. Our\nVaR measure assumes that exposures remain\nconstant and that recent market variability is\na good predictor of future variability. Actual\nobservations include customer-related revenue\nand intraday hedging, which helps to reduce\nlosses and can reduce the number of instances\nactual losses exceed the prior day VaR\nmeasure. There were no instances during 2022\nand 2021 under our diversified VaR measure\nwhere actual losses exceeded the prior-day VaR\nmeasure. Our portfolio and enterprise-wide VaR\nmodels utilize a historical approach with a\n500-day look-back period.\n\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $382\nmillion in 2022 compared with $372 million in\n2021 and is recorded in Other noninterest\nincome and Other interest income on our\nConsolidated Income Statement. The increase\nwas primarily due to higher foreign exchange\nand derivative client sales revenues,\npartially offset by the impact of the changes\nin credit valuations for customer-related\nderivative activities.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets. In\naddition to extending credit, taking deposits,\nunderwriting securities and trading financial\ninstruments, we make and manage direct\ninvestments in a variety of transactions,\nincluding management buyouts,\nrecapitalizations and growth financings in a\nvariety of industries. We also have\ninvestments in affiliated and non-affiliated\nfunds that make similar investments in private\nequity, consistent with regulatory\nlimitations.

These unfunded commitments are\nincluded in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNote 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities has further\ninformation on tax credit investments.\n\nPrivate Equity and Other\n\nThe largest component of our other equity\ninvestments is our private equity portfolio.\nThe private equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.8\nbillion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, $1.6\nbillion was invested directly in a variety of\ncompanies, and $0.2 billion was invested\nindirectly through various private equity\nfunds. See the Supervision and Regulation\nsection in Item 1 of this Report for\ndiscussion of the Volcker Rule limitations on\nour interests in and relationships with\nprivate funds.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the December 31, 2022\nper share closing price of $207.76 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.2 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings for additional\ninformation regarding our Visa agreements. The\nestimated value does not represent fair value\nof the Visa B common shares given the shares\u2019\nlimited transferability and the lack of\nobservable transactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $45 million in 2022 and $50\nmillion in 2021.\n                                              \n  Impact of Inflation                         \n                                              \nOur assets and liabilities are primarily\nfinancial in nature and typically have varying\nmaturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in\n\nprices do not affect the obligations to pay or\nreceive fixed and determinable amounts of\nmoney. However, during periods of inflation,\n\nthere may be a subsequent impact affecting\ncertain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of\nconsumer and customer purchasing power,\n\nand fluctuations in the need or demand for our\nproducts and services. When significant levels\nof inflation occur, our business could\n\npotentially be impacted by, among other\nthings, reducing our tolerance for extending\ncredit or causing us to incur additional\ncredit\n\nlosses resulting from possible increased\ndefault rates. Throughout most of 2022,\ninflation continued to rise but started to\nslow toward the end of the year. The Federal\nReserve monetary policy has tightened with the\nintent to slow inflation, which has led to\nlarger increases in interest rates. See Risk\nFactors in Item 1A, our Executive Summary and\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nstatements in this Item 7 for further\ndiscussion of inflation and its overall impact\nto the economy, our borrowers\u2019 ability to\nrepay their obligations and certain costs and\nexpenses to PNC.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional amount and an\nunderlying as specified in the contract.\nTherefore, cash requirements and exposure to\ncredit risk are significantly less than the\nnotional amount on these instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk Management                 \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to the current or\nprojected financial condition and resilience\narising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses or systems, human errors or\nmisconduct or adverse external events.\nOperational risk is inherent to the entire\norganization.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 79\nOperational risk management is embedded in our\nculture and decision-making processes through\na systematic approach whereby operational\nrisks and exposures are: (i) identified and\nassessed; (ii) managed through the design and\nimplementation of controls; (iii) measured and\nevaluated against our risk tolerance limits;\nand (iv) appropriately reported to management\nand the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. Strong operational risk management\nand well-informed risk-based decisions benefit\nus by improving the customer experience,\nenhancing compliance, reducing reputational\nrisk, minimizing losses and establishing an\nappropriate amount of required operational\nrisk capital held by us.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is\ndesigned to provide effective and consistent\nmanagement of operational risk. The primary\npurpose of the framework is to enable us to\nunderstand our operational risks and manage\nthem to the desired risk profile, in line with\nour Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance\nestablished within the framework assists\nmanagement in making well-informed risk-based\nbusiness decisions.\n\nThe framework provides a disciplined and\nstructured process for us to manage\noperational risk across eight operational risk\ndomains. These domains provide a comprehensive\nview of operational risk and allow us to\ndiscuss operational risk in a standard way,\nfacilitating reporting and ongoing risk\nmitigation.\n\nThe operational risk domains are:\n\n\u2022 Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate\nor failed internal processes, misconduct or\nerrors of people or fraud.\n\n\u2022 Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory\nsanctions, financial loss, or damage to\nreputation resulting from failure to comply\nwith laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory\nstandards or other regulatory requirements.\n\n\u2022 Data Management: Risk associated with\nincomplete or inaccurate data.\n\n\u2022 Model: Risk associated with the design,\nimplementation and ongoing use and management\nof models.\n\n\u2022 Technology and Systems: Risk associated with\nthe use, operation and adoption of technology.\n\n\u2022 Information Security: Risk resulting from\nthe failure to protect information and ensure\nappropriate access to, and use and handling\nof, information assets.\n\n\u2022 Business Continuity: Risk of potential\ndisruptive events to business activities.\n\n\u2022 Third Party: Risk arising from failure of\nthird-party providers to conduct activity in a\nsafe and sound manner and in compliance with\ncontract provisions and applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nWe utilize operational risk management\nprograms within the framework, including Risk\nand Control Self-Assessments, scenario\nanalysis, and internal and external loss event\nreviews and analysis, to assess existing\nrisks, determine potential/emerging risks and\nevaluate the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols. Program tools and methodology assist\nour business managers in identifying potential\nrisks and control gaps.\n\nLines of business are responsible for\nidentifying, owning, managing and monitoring\nthe operational risks and controls associated\nwith their business activities and product or\nservice offerings to within acceptable levels.\nCentralized functions, such as Business\nContinuity, Enterprise Third Party Management\nand Information Security, are responsible for\nthe development, implementation and management\nof their individual programs and for the\ndevelopment and maintenance of the policies,\nprocedures, methodologies, tools and\ntechnology utilized across the enterprise to\nidentify, assess, monitor and report program\nrisks. Additionally, independent risk\nmanagement reviews and challenges line of\nbusiness adherence to the framework to help\nensure proper controls are in place and\nappropriate risk mitigation plans are\nestablished as necessary.\n                                              \n  Conduct, Reputational and Strategic Risk    \n                                              \nPNC\u2019s risk culture seeks to reinforce the\nappropriate protocols for responsible and\nethical behavior through sound processes and\ncontrols. In order to promote a robust risk\nculture, the Board and executive management\nestablish code of conduct and professional\nstandards to which all employees must adhere.\nA strong risk culture discourages misconduct\nand supports conduct risk management at PNC.\nConduct risk is defined as the risk that\nemployees fail to comply with the ethical\nstandards expected of them. Strong conduct\nrisk management is important in supporting\nPNC\u2019s reputation, and PNC maintains a\ncorporate culture that emphasizes complying\nwith laws, regulations, and managing\nreputational risks. Reputational risk is the\nrisk to the franchise and/or shareholder value\nbased on a negative perception of PNC by its\nstakeholders and/or the changing expectations\nof its stakeholders. Strategic risk is another\ncomponent of the ERM Framework that is also\ncritical to optimizing shareholder returns.\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings that\nmay arise from adverse business decisions,\nimproper implementation of business decisions\nand/or inadequate response to changes in the\nbusiness environment. Strategic risk is\nconsidered and assessed by our businesses in\nthe annual strategic planning processes and\nmonitored on an on-going basis as those plans\nare carried out.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nEnterprise Compliance is responsible for\noversight of compliance risk for the\norganization. Compliance issues are identified\nand tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring\nand testing activities. Compliance risk issues\nare escalated through a comprehensive risk\nreporting process at both a business and\nenterprise level and incorporated, as\nappropriate, into the development and\nassessment of our operational risk profile. A\nmanagement committee, chaired by the Chief\nCompliance Officer, is responsible for\noversight of compliance and fiduciary risk\nmanagement programs across PNC. Enterprise\nCompliance, through the Regulatory Change\nProgram,\n\n80 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nhelps PNC understand and proactively address\nemerging regulatory topics and risks as well\nas respond to changes in applicable laws and\nregulations. To understand emerging issues\nimpacting the industry, Enterprise Compliance\ncommunicates regularly with various regulators\nhaving supervisory or regulatory\nresponsibilities with respect to us, our\nsubsidiaries, or businesses and participates\nin forums focused on regulatory and compliance\nmatters in the financial services industry.\n                                              \n  Information Security Risk                   \n                                              \nThe Information Security component of our\nOperational Risk Management Framework is\nresponsible for protecting information assets\nto achieve business objectives, which includes\ncybersecurity.

Note 1 Accounting Policies describes\nthe most significant accounting policies that\nwe use. Certain of these policies require us\nto make estimates or economic assumptions that\nmay vary under different assumptions or\nconditions, and such variations may\nsignificantly affect our reported results and\nfinancial position for the period or in future\nperiods.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments and\nestimated recoveries. Our determination of the\nACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future conditions and\nother relevant factors. We use methods\nsensitive to changes in economic conditions to\ninterpret these factors and to estimate\nexpected credit losses. We evaluate and, when\nappropriate, enhance the quality of our data\nand models and other methods used to estimate\nACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate\nqualitative factors in the ACL that reflect\nour best estimate of expected losses that may\nnot be adequately represented in our\nquantitative methods or economic assumptions.\nThe major drivers of ACL estimates include,\nbut are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Change to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\nAccounting Policies.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder the CECL standard, we are required to\nconsider reasonable and supportable forecasts\nin estimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose, we have established a framework that\nincludes a three-year forecast period and the\nuse of four economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes. Credit losses estimated in our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period are\nsensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 81\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented to RAC for\napproval, and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios\u2019 weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2022 reflect an increase in\ndownside risk compared to December 31, 2021.\nThe current outlook considers the inflationary\npressures that have broadened and intensified\nsince the start of 2022, along with the fact\nthat the FOMC raised interest rates more\naggressively than what was expected at\nDecember 31, 2021, increasing the risk of a\nbroader-ranged economic slowdown. Our most-\nlikely expectation at December 31, 2022 is\nthat the U.S. economy enters a mild recession\nin 2023.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being Real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nTable 38: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2022                  \n                        2023    2024    2025  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. Real           (0.4)%    1.4%    1.9%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.9%    4.9%    4.4%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2021                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n  U.S. Real             2.8%    1.4%    1.3%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.4%    4.1%    3.9%  \n  Rate (c)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss)\nrates.\n\n(b) Represents the average forecasted\nunemployment rate for the fourth quarters of\n2023, 2024 and 2025 as of December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Represents the average forecasted\nunemployment rate for the fourth quarters of\n2022, 2023 and 2024 as of December 31, 2021.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to decline 0.4% in\n2023 on a weighted average basis, driven\nprimarily by our most likely scenario that the\nU.S. economy enters a mild recession during\nthe year. Growth rises to 1.4% in 2024, before\ngrowing to 1.9% in 2025. In line with the\nslowing in overall economic activity, the\nweighted average unemployment rate is expected\nto increase throughout 2023, peaking at 5.1%\nduring the first half of 2024 and gradually\nimproving to 4.4% by the fourth quarter of\n2025.\n\nThe current state of the economy reflects an\nenvironment with receding COVID-19 related\nrisks, but heightened uncertainty remains due\nto structural and secular changes fostered by\nthe pandemic for certain sectors of the\neconomy combined with inflation, rising\ninterest rates and ongoing supply chain\npressures. As such, for both our commercial\nand consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified\nand performed significant analysis around\nsegments impacted by such uncertainties to\nensure our reserves are adequate, given our\ncurrent macroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nappropriately reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nTo provide additional context regarding the\nsensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic\nforecast of expected economic outcomes, we\nconsidered what our ACL would be when applying\na 100% probability weighting to the most\nsevere downside CECL scenario. This severe\ndownside scenario estimated that Real GDP\ncontracted in 2023 ending the year down 2.5%\ncompared to 2022 levels, with growth picking\nup again by the end of 2024. The unemployment\nrate in this scenario increased to end 2023 at\n6.3%, then sees a peak rate of 7.3% in the\nsecond half of 2024, before gradually\nimproving to 6.4% by the end of 2025.\nExcluding consideration of qualitative\nadjustments, this sensitivity analysis would\nresult in a hypothetical increase in our ACL\nof $1.6 billion at December 31, 2022. This\nscenario does not reflect our current\nexpectation at December 31, 2022, nor does it\ncapture all the potential unknown variables\nthat could arise in the forecast period, but\nit provides an approximation of a possible\noutcome under hypothetical severe conditions.\nThe CECL methodology inherently requires a\nhigh degree of judgment, and as a result, it\nis possible that we may, at another point in\ntime, reach different conclusions regarding\nour credit loss estimates.\n\nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing\nRights\n\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value.\nThis election was made to be consistent with\nour risk management strategy to hedge changes\nin the fair value of these assets. The fair\nvalue of our MSRs is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model that\n\n82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\ncalculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into\nconsideration actual and expected mortgage\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs, and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\n\nWe employ risk management strategies designed\nto protect the value of MSRs from changes in\ninterest rates and related market factors. The\nvalues of the MSRs are economically hedged\nwith securities and derivatives, including\ninterest-rate swaps, options, and forward\nmortgage-backed and futures contracts. As\ninterest rates change, these financial\ninstruments are expected to have changes in\nfair value negatively correlated to the change\nin fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios.\nThe hedge relationships are actively managed\nin response to changing market conditions over\nthe life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate\nfinancial instruments to economically hedge\nresidential or commercial MSRs requires\nsignificant management judgment to assess how\nmortgage rates and prepayment speeds could\naffect the future values of MSRs. Hedging\nresults can frequently be less predictable in\nthe short term, but over longer periods of\ntime, they are expected to protect the\neconomic value of the MSRs.\n\nFor information on how each estimate has\nchanged and a sensitivity analysis of the\nhypothetical effect of the fair value of MSRs\nto immediate adverse changes in key\nassumptions, see Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage\nServicing Rights. For additional information\non our residential and commercial MSRs, see\nNote 1 Accounting Policies, Note 6 Goodwill\nand Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair\nValue.\n                                              \n  Fair Value Measurements - Level 3           \n                                              \nWe must use estimates, assumptions and\njudgments when assets and liabilities are\nrequired to be recorded at, or adjusted to\nreflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value inherently result in a\nhigher degree of financial statement\nvolatility. When observable price and third-\nparty information is not available, we\nestimate fair value primarily by using cash\nflow and other financial modeling techniques.\nChanges in underlying factors, assumptions, or\nestimates in any of these valuation techniques\ncould materially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nWe apply ASC 820 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\nThis guidance defines fair value as the price\nthat would be received to sell a financial\nasset or paid to transfer a financial\nliability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nThis guidance requires a three-level hierarchy\nfor disclosure of assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value. The classification of\nassets and liabilities within the hierarchy is\nbased on whether the inputs to the valuation\nmethodology used in the measurement are\nobservable or unobservable. Level 3 assets and\nliabilities are those where the fair value is\nestimated using significant unobservable\ninputs. While estimating potential\nsensitivities around fair value measurements\nis inherently challenging, we provide a\nsummary of the key unobservable inputs in Note\n15 Fair Value.\n\nFor additional information on Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements, see Note 15 Fair Value.\n                                              \n  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  \n                                              \nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies regarding the\nimpact of new accounting pronouncements that\nwe have adopted.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 83\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time.

These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The economy continues to expand in early\n2023, but economic growth is slowing in\nresponse to the ongoing Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy tightening to slow inflation.\nThis has led to large increases in both short-\nand long-term interest rates. With much higher\nmortgage rates the housing market is already\nin contraction, with steep drops in existing\nhome sales and single-family housing starts,\nand a modest decline in house prices. Other\nsectors where interest rates play an outsized\nrole, such as business investment and consumer\nspending on durable goods, will contract in\n2023.\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline outlook is for a recession\nstarting in the second half of 2023, with real\nGDP contracting a modest 1% before recovery\nstarts in early 2024 as the Federal Reserve\nlowers interest rates in response to a\ndeteriorating labor market and slower\ninflation. The unemployment rate will increase\nthroughout 2023, peaking at above 5% in the\nfirst half of 2024. Inflation will slow with\nthe recession and be back to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective by early\n2024.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to increase the federal\nfunds rate by an additional 25 basis points in\nMarch. This would bring the federal funds rate\nto a range of 4.75% to 5.00% by mid-March. PNC\nexpects a federal funds rate cut of 25 basis\npoints in early 2024 as inflation moves toward\nthe FOMC\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities.

\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheet of The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the\n\u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nand the related consolidated statements of\nincome, of comprehensive income, of changes in\nequity and of cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022,\nincluding the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial\nstatements\u201d). We also have audited the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2022 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCOSO.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company changed the\nmanner in which it accounts for the allowance\nfor credit losses in 2020.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinions                          \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for\nthese consolidated financial statements, for\nmaintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\n86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matter communicated below\nis a matter arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter\nor on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\n\nAllowance for Loans and Lease Losses \u2013\nCommercial Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loans and lease losses was\napproximately $4,741 million as of December\n31, 2022, of which $3,114 million relates to\ncommercial loans. For commercial loans, the\ndetermination of the allowance is based on\nhistorical loss experience, current borrower\nrisk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\neconomic forecasts and other relevant factors.\nAs disclosed by management, the Company\nconsiders reasonable and supportable forecasts\nin estimating expected credit losses and has\nestablished a framework which includes the use\nof four economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. To generate the four economic\nforecast scenarios, the Company uses a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic\nmodels, other measures of economic activity\nand forward-looking judgment to forecast the\ndistribution of economic outcomes. Management\nused a number of economic variables in the\nscenarios, which are inputs into the loss\nforecasting models, with the most significant\ndrivers being Real GDP and U.S. unemployment\nrate. Also included in the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans are\nqualitative reserves to cover losses that are\nexpected but, in the Company\u2019s assessment, may\nnot be adequately represented in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. For example, qualitative factors\nmay include industry concentration and\nconditions, changes in market conditions,\nchanges in the nature and volume of the\nCompany\u2019s portfolio, recent credit quality\ntrends, recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, recent macroeconomic factors,\nlimitations of available input data, model\nimprecision, changes in lending policies, and\nother factors.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in developing\neconomic forecast scenarios of Real GDP and\nU.S. unemployment rate, determining weighting\nof each scenario, and estimating qualitative\nreserves, which in turn led to a high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort\nin performing procedures and in evaluating\naudit evidence related to management\u2019s\nsignificant judgements and estimations and\n(ii) the audit effort involved professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans,\nincluding controls over the development and\napproval of economic forecast scenarios,\nrelated weightings, and qualitative reserves.\nThese procedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for determining\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans, including (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness and methodology of certain\nloss forecasting models, (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain borrower risk\ncharacteristics, (iii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain forecasted economic\nvariables, including Real GDP and U.S.\nunemployment rate, (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s weighting of\neconomic forecast scenarios used in the loss\nforecast models, (v) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the estimate, and\n(vi) evaluating certain qualitative reserves\nmade to the model output results to determine\nthe overall allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans. The procedures\nalso included the involvement of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist\nin evaluating certain models, model inputs,\neconomic forecasts, and qualitative reserves\nin the allowance for commercial loans.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since\n2007.\n The

Our results of\noperations and balance sheets for all periods\npresented in this Report reflect the benefit\nof BBVA\u2019s acquired businesses for the period\nsince the acquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\nSee Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture\nActivity for additional information related to\nthis acquisition.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior-year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nNoninterest Income Presentation\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nupdated the presentation of its noninterest\nincome categorization to be based on product\nand service type, and accordingly, has changed\nthe basis of presentation of its noninterest\nincome revenue streams to: (i) Asset\nmanagement and brokerage, (ii) Capital markets\nrelated, (iii) Card and cash management, (iv)\nLending and deposit services, (v) Residential\nand commercial mortgage and (vi) Other\nnoninterest income. Additionally, in the\nfourth quarter of 2022, PNC updated the name\nof the noninterest income line item \u201cCapital\nmarkets related\u201d to \u201cCapital markets and\nadvisory.\u201d This update did not impact the\ncomponents of the category. A description of\neach revenue stream follows:\nAsset management and brokerage includes\nrevenue from our asset management and retail\nbrokerage businesses. Asset management\nservices include investment management,\ncustody, retirement planning, family planning,\ntrust management and retirement\nadministration. Brokerage services offer\nretail customers a wide range of investment\noptions, including mutual funds, annuities,\nstock, bonds and managed accounts.\nCapital markets and advisory includes revenue\nfrom services and activities primarily related\nto merger and acquisition advisory, equity\ncapital markets advisory, asset-backed\nfinancing, loan syndication, securities\nunderwriting, credit valuation adjustments\nrelated to the derivatives portfolio and\ncustomer-related trading.\nCard and cash management includes revenue\nprimarily from debit and credit card\nactivities, inclusive of credit card points\nand rewards, treasury management services and\nATM fees. Debit and credit card activities\ninclude interchange revenue and merchant\nservice fees. Treasury management services\ninclude cash and investment management,\nreceivables and disbursement management, funds\ntransfer, international payment and access to\nonline/mobile information management and\nreporting.\nLending and deposit services includes revenue\nprimarily related to service charges on\ndeposits, loan commitment and usage fees, the\nissuance of standby letters of credit,\noperating lease income and long-term care and\ninsurance products.\nResidential and commercial mortgage includes\nthe gain and loss on sale of mortgages,\nrevenue related to our mortgage servicing\nresponsibilities, mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation adjustments and net gains on\noriginations and sales of loans held for sale.\n94 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nOther noninterest income is primarily composed\nof private equity revenue, net securities\ngains and losses, activity related to our\nequity investment in Visa and gains and losses\non asset sales.\n\nSee Note 24 Fee-based Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers for additional details related\nto these revenue streams within the scope of\nASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers .\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements, including for the\nBBVA acquisition. Actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates and the differences may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a primary\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nInvestments\nWe hold interests in various types of\ninvestments. The accounting for these\ninvestments is dependent on a number of\nfactors including, but not limited to, items\nsuch as:\n\u2022 Ownership interest,\n\u2022 Our plans for the investment, and\n\u2022 The nature of the investment.\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date\nbasis. We classify debt securities as either\ntrading, held to maturity, or available for\nsale. Debt securities that we purchase for\ncertain risk management activities or\ncustomer-related trading activities are\nclassified as trading securities, are reported\nin the Other assets line item on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and are carried at\nfair value. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses on trading securities are included in\nOther noninterest income. We classify debt\nsecurities as held to maturity when we have\nthe positive intent and ability to hold the\nsecurities to maturity, and carry them at\namortized cost, less any allowance. Debt\nsecurities not classified as held to maturity\nor trading are classified as securities\navailable for sale and are carried at fair\nvalue. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale securities are included in\nAOCI net of income taxes.\nWe include all interest on debt securities,\nincluding amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on investment\nsecurities, in net interest income using the\nconstant effective yield method generally\ncalculated over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities. Effective yields reflect either\nthe effective interest rate implicit in the\nsecurity at the date of acquisition or, for\ndebt securities where an OTTI was recorded,\nthe effective interest rate determined based\non improved cash flows subsequent to an\nimpairment. We compute gains and losses\nrealized on the sale of available for sale\ndebt securities on a specific security basis.\nThese securities gains and losses are included\nin Other noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\nThe CECL standard requires expected credit\nlosses on both held to maturity and available\nfor sale securities to be recognized through a\nvaluation allowance, ACL, instead of as a\ndirect write-down to the amortized cost basis\nof the security. An available for sale\nsecurity is considered impaired if the fair\nvalue is less than its amortized cost basis.\nIf any portion of the decline in fair value is\nrelated to credit, the amount of allowance is\ndetermined as the portion related to credit,\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis and the fair value of the\nsecurity. If we have the intent to sell or\nbelieve it is more likely than not we will be\nrequired to sell an impaired available for\nsale security before recovery of the amortized\ncost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a\ndirect write-down of the amortized cost basis.\nCredit losses on investment securities are\nrecognized through the Provision for credit\nlosses on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nDeclines in the fair value of available for\nsale securities that are not considered credit\nrelated are recognized in AOCI on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe consider a security to be past due in terms\nof payment based on its contractual terms. A\nsecurity may be placed on nonaccrual, with\ninterest no longer recognized until received,\nwhen collectability of principal or interest\nis doubtful. As of December 31, 2022,\nnonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity and\navailable-for-sale securities were immaterial.\nA security may be partially or fully charged\noff against the allowance if it is determined\nto be uncollectible, including, for an\navailable for sale security, if we have the\nintent to sell or believe it is more likely\nthan not we will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of the amortized cost\nbasis. Recoveries of previously charged-off\navailable for sale securities are recognized\nwhen received, while recoveries on held to\nmaturity securities are recognized when\nexpected.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 95\nSee the Allowance for Credit Losses section of\nthis Note 1 for further discussion regarding\nthe methodologies used to determine the\n\nallowance for investment securities. See Note\n3 Investment Securities for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio and the related ACL.\n\nEquity Securities and Partnership Interests\n\nWe account for equity securities, equity\ninvestments, private equity investments, and\ninvestments in limited partnerships, limited\nliability companies and other investments that\nare not required to be consolidated under one\nof the following methods:\n\n\u2022 We use the equity method for general and\nlimited partner ownership interests and\nlimited liability companies in which we are\nconsidered to have significant influence over\nthe operations of the investee. Under the\nequity method, we record our equity ownership\nshare of net income or loss of the investee in\nNoninterest income and any dividends received\non equity method investments are recorded as a\nreduction to the investment balance. When an\nequity investment experiences an other-than-\ntemporary decline in value, we may be required\nto record a loss on the investment.\n\n\u2022 We measure equity securities that have a\nreadily determinable fair value at fair value\nthrough Net income. Both realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are included in\nNoninterest income. Dividend income on these\nequity securities is included in Other\ninterest income on our Consolidated Income\nStatement.\n\n\u2022 We generally use the practicability\nexception to fair value measurement for all\nother investments without a readily\ndeterminable fair value. When we elect this\nalternative measurement method, the investment\nis recorded at cost and the carrying value is\nadjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus\nchanges in value resulting from observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for\nidentical or similar instruments of the same\nissuer. Adjustments to fair value based on\nchanges in observable price are recorded in\nOther noninterest income. These investments\nare written down to fair value if a\nqualitative assessment indicates impairment\nand the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue. The amount of the write-down is\naccounted for as a loss included in Other\nnoninterest income. Distributions received on\nthese investments are included in Noninterest\nincome.\n\nInvestments described above are included in\nEquity investments on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\nPrivate Equity Investments\n\nWe report private equity investments, which\ninclude direct investments in companies,\naffiliated partnership interests and indirect\ninvestments in private equity funds, at\nestimated fair value. These estimates are\nbased on available information and may not\nnecessarily represent amounts that we will\nultimately realize through distribution, sale\nor liquidation of the investments. Fair values\nof publicly-traded direct investments are\ndetermined using quoted market prices and are\nsubject to various discount factors arising\nfrom security level restrictions, when\nappropriate. The valuation procedures applied\nto direct investments and indirect investments\nare detailed in Note 15 Fair Value. We include\nall private equity investments within Equity\ninvestments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in fair value of private equity\ninvestments are recognized in Other\nnoninterest income.\n\nWe consolidate affiliated partnerships when we\nhave determined that we have control of the\npartnership or are the primary beneficiary if\nthe entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own\nis reflected in Noncontrolling interests on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. See Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information on how COVID-19\nhardship related loan modifications are\nreported from a delinquency perspective as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method over the\ncontractual life. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method,\nover the contractual life of the loan. The\nprocessing fee received for loans originated\nthrough PPP lending under the CARES Act is\ndeferred and accreted into Net interest income\nusing the effective yield method, over the\ncontractual life of the loan. Loans under the\nfair value option are reported at their fair\nvalue, with any changes to fair value reported\nas Noninterest income on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement, and are excluded from\nmeasurement of ALLL.\n96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination ( i.e. , PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe acquisition date. PNC considers a variety\nof factors in connection with the\nidentification of more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality, including but\nnot limited to nonperforming status,\ndelinquency, risk ratings, TDR classification\nand other qualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that are attributable, at least in\npart, to credit quality are recognized through\na charge to the provision for credit losses\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nare recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL .\n\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\n\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, or when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to measure the loan at the estimated\nfair value of collateral (less costs to sell\nif sale or foreclosure of the property is\nexpected).\n\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable.\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. A concession has been\ngranted when we do not expect to collect all\namounts due, including original interest\naccrued at the original contract rate, as a\nresult of the restructuring, or there is a\ndelay in payment that is more-than-\ninsignificant. TDRs result from our loss\nmitigation activities, and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization, and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us. In those\nsituations where principal is forgiven, the\namount of such principal forgiveness is\nimmediately charged off.\n\nPotential incremental losses or recoveries on\nTDRs have been factored into the ALLL\nestimates for each loan class under the\nmethodologies described in this Note. Once a\nloan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be\nreported as a TDR until it is ultimately\nrepaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed\nupon or it is fully charged off.\n\nPNC excludes loans held for sale, loans\naccounted for under the fair value option and\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfrom our TDR population. PCD loans do not\nrequire additional considerations and thus are\nevaluated for inclusion in our TDR population.\nPrior to the expiration of TDR relief on\nJanuary 1, 2022, PNC elected not to apply a\nTDR designation to loans that were\nrestructured due to a COVID-19 hardship\npursuant to specific criteria under the CARES\nAct. Since loans restructured due to a\nCOVID-19 related hardship were not identified\nas TDRs, they were not placed on nonaccrual at\nthe time of modification unless payment in\nfull of principal or interest was not\nexpected. These loans continued to be subject\nto our existing nonaccrual policy.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and\nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL\nand additional details on the composition of\nour loan portfolio:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note

                   \nCommercial\n\nWe generally charge-off commercial (commercial\nand industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well-secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform. For commercial\nloans and leases less than a defined dollar\nthreshold, balances are charged-off in full\nafter pre-determined days past due.\n\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell, if\nlower than the amortized cost basis of the\nloan outstanding, when delinquency of the\nloan, combined with other risk factors ( e.g.\n, bankruptcy, lien position or troubled debt\nrestructuring), indicates that the loan, or\nsome portion thereof, is uncollectible as per\nour historical experience, or the collateral\nhas been repossessed. We charge-off secured\nconsumer loans no later than 180days past due.\nMost consumer loans and lines of credit, not\nsecured by automobiles or residential real\nestate, are charged-off once they have reached\n120- 180days past due.\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected,\nlimited to amounts previously charged-off.\n\n98 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, depending on\nwhether the accrued interest has been\nincorporated into the ACL estimates, as\ndiscussed in the Accrued Interest section of\nthis Note 1, the accrued and uncollected\ninterest is either reversed through Net\ninterest income (if a CECL reserve is not\nmaintained for accrued interest) or charged-\noff against the allowance (if a CECL reserve\nis maintained for accrued interest), except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged-off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance; payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as fee and interest income. For\ncertain consumer loans, the receipt of\ninterest payments is recognized as interest\nincome on a cash basis. Cash basis income\nrecognition is applied if a loan\u2019s amortized\ncost basis is deemed fully collectible and the\nloan has performed for at least six months.\n\nFor TDRs, payments are applied based upon\ntheir contractual terms unless the related\nloan is deemed non-performing. TDRs are\ngenerally included in nonperforming and\nnonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable\nperiod of time, generally six months, in which\nthe loan performs under restructured terms and\nmeets other performance indicators, it is\nreturned to performing/accruing status. This\nreturn to performing/accruing status\ndemonstrates that the bank expects to collect\nall of the loan\u2019s remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest. TDRs resulting from\n(i) borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us, and (ii)\nborrowers that are not currently obligated to\nmake both principal and interest payments\nunder the restructured terms are not returned\nto accrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accrual status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collection of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal are not returned to accrual. When a\nnonperforming loan is returned to accrual\nstatus, it is then considered a performing\nloan.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\ncommercial and residential real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information on\nnonperforming assets, TDRs and credit quality\nindicators related to our loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL, in accordance with the CECL standard\nadopted on January 1, 2020, is based on\nhistorical loss experience, current borrower\nrisk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an\nappropriate level for expected losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the estimated contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures as of the\nbalance sheet date. The remaining contractual\nterm of assets in scope of CECL is estimated\nconsidering contractual maturity dates,\nprepayment expectations, utilization or draw\nexpectations and any embedded extension\noptions that do not allow us to unilaterally\ncancel the extension options. For products\nwithout a fixed contractual maturity date (\ne.g ., credit cards), we rely on historical\npayment behavior to determine the length of\nthe paydown or default time period.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long-run\naverage expected losses where applicable and\n(iii) the long run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term. For\nall assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                  Form 10-K 99\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, analysis\nfrom PNC economists and management judgment.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio, and\ntherefore do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\n\nSee the following sections related to\ninvestment securities, loans, trade\nreceivables, other financial assets and\nunfunded lending related commitments for\ndetails about specific methodologies.\n\nAllowance for Investment Securities\n\nA significant portion of our investment\nsecurities are issued or guaranteed by either\nthe U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or GNMA) or\na government-sponsored agency (FNMA or FHLMC).\nTaking into consideration historical\ninformation and current and forecasted\nconditions, we do not expect to incur any\ncredit losses on these securities.\n\nInvestment securities that are not issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or a\ngovernment-sponsored agency consist of both\nsecuritized products, such as non-agency\nmortgage and asset-backed securities, as well\nas non-securitized products, such as corporate\nand municipal debt securities. A discounted\ncash flow approach is primarily used to\ndetermine the amount of the allowance\nrequired. The estimates of expected cash flows\nare determined using macroeconomic sensitive\nmodels taking into consideration the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period and\nscenarios discussed above. Additional factors\nunique to a specific security may also be\ntaken into consideration when estimating\nexpected cash flows. The cash flows expected\nto be collected, after considering expected\nprepayments, are discounted at the effective\ninterest rate. For an available-for-sale\nsecurity, the amount of the allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nestimated fair value.\n\nSee Note 3 Investment Securities for\nadditional information about the investment\nsecurities portfolio.\n\n100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan, loan\nsegment or lease. We also consider the impact\nof prepayments and amortization on contractual\nmaturity in our expected loss estimates. We\nuse historical credit loss information,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables for the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\ncoupled with analytical methods, to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan, loan segment or\nlease. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario and\nthe long run average period, and combined to\ngenerate expected loss estimates by scenario.\nThe following matrix provides key credit risk\ncharacteristics that we use to estimate these\nrisk parameters.\n                                              \n  Loan       Probabi\u2026    Loss       Exposure  \n  Class      of

forecast period, we revert to the\nlong run average over the reversion period\nnoted above, which is the period between the\nend of the forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate by loan class. We then add or deduct\nany qualitative components and other\nadjustments, such as individually assessed\nloans, to produce the ALLL. See the\nIndividually Assessed Component and\nQualitative Component discussions that follow\nin this Note 1 for additional information\nabout those adjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nIn addition to TDRs, we also use a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes. We\ndetermine effective interest rates considering\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for estimated\nprepayments. Changes in the ALLL due to the\nimpact of the passage of time under the\ndiscounted cash flow estimate are recognized\nthrough the provision for credit losses.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold,\nand accruing TDRs are reserved for under a\npooled basis.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged-off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses attributable to such risks. The ACL\nalso takes into account factors that may not\nbe directly measured in the determination of\nindividually assessed or pooled reserves. Such\nqualitative factors may include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\n102 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures,\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities and Nonperforming Loans\nand Leases sections of this Note 1 for\nadditional information on our nonaccrual and\ncharge-off policies.\nAdditionally, pursuant to our use of a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology in estimating\ncredit losses for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes,\napplicable reserves for accrued interest are\nalso included within the ALLL for these loan\nclasses .\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition\n(including January 1, 2020 when certain\npurchased impaired loans were exempted and\ntransitioned to PCD upon adoption of CECL), as\nthe estimated expected credit loss of the\noutstanding balance or par value, based on the\nmethodologies described previously for loans\nand securities. In accordance with CECL, the\nallowance recognized at acquisition is added\nto the acquisition date purchase price to\ndetermine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable ( e.g. , unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan\nand Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for\nthe key credit risk characteristics for\nunfunded lending related commitments. The\nallowance for unfunded lending related\ncommitments is recorded as a liability on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to\nthis reserve are included in the provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.\n\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets\n\nWe determine the allowance for other financial\nassets ( e.g. , trade receivables, servicing\nadvances on PNC-owned loans, balances with\nbanks) considering historical loss information\nand other available indicators. In certain\ncases where there are no historical, current\nor forecast indicators of an expected credit\nloss, we may estimate the reserve to be close\nto zero. As of December 31, 2022, the\nallowance for other financial assets was\nimmaterial.\nLoans Held for Sale\nWe designate loans as held for sale when we\nhave the intent and ability to sell them. At\nthe time of designation to held for sale, any\nACL is reversed, and a valuation allowance for\nthe shortfall between the amortized cost basis\nand the net realizable value is recognized,\nexcluding the amounts already charged off.\nSimilarly, when loans are no longer considered\nheld for sale, the valuation allowance (net of\nwritedowns) is reversed, and an allowance for\ncredit losses is established, excluding the\namounts already charged-off. Write-downs on\nthese loans (if required) are recorded as\ncharge-offs through the valuation allowance.\nAdjustments to the valuation allowance on held\nfor sale loans are recognized in Other\nnoninterest income.\nWe have elected to account for certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale at fair value. The changes in the\nfair value of commercial and residential\nmortgage loans are measured and recorded\nwithin Residential and Commercial mortgage\nwithin Noninterest Income each period. See\nNote 15 Fair Value for additional information.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 103\nInterest income with respect to loans held for\nsale is accrued based on the principal amount\noutstanding and the loan\u2019s contractual\ninterest rate.\n\nIn certain circumstances, loans designated as\nheld for sale may be transferred to held for\ninvestment based on a change in strategy. We\ntransfer these loans at the lower of cost or\nestimated fair value; however, any loans\noriginated or purchased for the held for sale\nportfolio and for which the fair value option\nhas been elected remain at fair value for the\nlife of the loan.\nLoan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained\nInterests\nWe recognize the sale of loans or other\nfinancial assets when the transferred assets\nare legally isolated from our creditors and\nthe appropriate accounting criteria are met.\nWe have sold mortgage and other loans through\nsecuritization transactions. In a\nsecuritization, financial assets are\ntransferred into trusts or to SPEs in\ntransactions to effectively legally isolate\nthe assets from us.\nIn a securitization, the trust or SPE issues\nbeneficial interests in the form of senior and\nsubordinated securities backed or\ncollateralized by the assets sold to the\ntrust. The senior classes of the asset-backed\nsecurities typically receive investment grade\ncredit ratings at the time of issuance. These\nratings are generally achieved through the\ncreation of lower-rated subordinated classes\nof asset-backed securities, as well as\nsubordinated or residual interests. In certain\ncases, we may retain a portion or all of the\nsecurities issued, interest-only strips, one\nor more subordinated tranches, servicing\nrights and, in some cases, cash reserve\naccounts. Securitized loans are removed from\nthe balance sheet and a net gain or loss is\nrecognized in Noninterest income at the time\nof initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on\nthe sale of the loans depend on the fair value\nof the loans sold and the retained interests\nat the date of sale. We generally estimate the\nfair value of the retained interests based on\nthe present value of future expected cash\nflows using assumptions as to discount rates,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, credit\nlosses and servicing costs, if applicable.\nWith the exception of loan sales to certain\nU.S. government-chartered entities, our loan\nsales and securitizations are generally\nstructured without recourse to us except for\nrepresentations and warranties and with no\nrestrictions on the retained interests. We\noriginate, sell and service commercial\nmortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program.\nUnder the provisions of the DUS program, we\nparticipate in a loss-sharing arrangement with\nFNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing\nor recourse, our policy is to record such\nliabilities initially at fair value and\nsubsequently reserve for estimated losses in\naccordance with guidance contained in\napplicable GAAP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited\nliability company, or any other legal\nstructure used to conduct activities or hold\nassets generally that either:\n\u2022 Does not have equity investors with voting\nrights that can directly or indirectly make\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s most significant\neconomic activities through those voting\nrights or similar rights, or\n\u2022 Has equity investors that do not provide\nsufficient equity for the entity to finance\nits activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support.\nA VIE often holds financial assets, including\nloans or receivables, real estate or other\nproperty.\nVIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC\n810 \u2013 Consolidation when we hold a variable\ninterest in these entities. We consolidate a\nVIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The\nprimary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to\nbe the party that meets both of the following\ncriteria: (i) has the power to make decisions\nthat most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE; and (ii) has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Upon\nconsolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of\nthe VIE\u2019s assets, liabilities and\nnoncontrolling interests on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we\ndetermine whether any changes occurred\nrequiring a reassessment of whether we are the\nprimary beneficiary of an entity.\nSee Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities\nand Variable Interest Entities for information\nabout VIEs that we consolidate as well as\nthose that we do not consolidate but in which\nwe hold a significant variable interest.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe provide servicing under various loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential loans. These contracts are either\npurchased in the open market or retained as\npart of a loan securitization or loan sale.\nAll acquired or originated servicing rights\nare measured at fair value. Fair value is\nbased on the present value of the expected\nfuture net cash flows, including assumptions\nas to:\n\u2022 Deposit balances and interest rates for\nescrow and commercial reserve earnings,\n\u2022 Discount rates,\n\u2022 Estimated prepayment speeds, and\n\u2022 Estimated servicing costs.\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nWe measure commercial and residential MSRs at\nfair value in order to reduce any potential\nmeasurement mismatch between our economic\nhedges and the MSRs. We manage the risk by\nhedging the fair value of MSRs with\nderivatives and securities which are expected\nto increase in value when the value of the\nservicing right declines. Changes in the fair\nvalue of MSRs are recognized as\ngains/(losses). The fair value of these\nservicing rights is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model which\ncalculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into\nconsideration actual and expected mortgage\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nSee Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions\nrepresents the value attributable to\nunidentifiable intangible elements in the\nbusiness acquired. At least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events\noccur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date,\nmanagement performs the goodwill impairment\ntest at a reporting unit level.\nPNC may first perform a qualitative analysis\nto evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. If, after\nconsidering all relevant events and\ncircumstances, PNC determines it is not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, then performing a quantitative\nimpairment test is not necessary. If PNC\nelects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or\nconcludes via qualitative analysis that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest is performed. Inputs are generated and\nused in calculating the fair value of the\nreporting unit, which is compared to its\ncarrying amount. The fair value of our\nreporting units is determined by using\ndiscounted cash flows and/or market\ncomparability methodologies. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying amount, an entity should recognize an\nimpairment charge for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of goodwill exceeds the\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value. The loss\nrecognized should not exceed the total amount\nof goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nSee Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\n\nLeases\n\nLessor Arrangements\n\nWe provide financing for various types of\nequipment, including aircraft, energy and\npower systems and vehicles through a variety\nof lease arrangements. Finance leases are\ncarried at the aggregate of lease payments\nplus estimated residual value of the leased\nequipment, less unearned income. Leveraged\nleases, a form of financing leases, are\ncarried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize\nincome over the term of the lease using the\nconstant effective yield method. Lease\nresidual values are reviewed for impairment at\nleast annually. Gains or losses on the sale of\nleased assets are included in Other\nnoninterest income. Valuation adjustments on\noperating lease residuals are included in\nOther noninterest expense while valuation\nadjustments on the net investment of a direct\nfinancing or sales-type lease are included in\nProvision for credit losses.\nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office\nspace, land and equipment under operating and\nfinance leases. Under ASC 842, we elected the\npractical expedient to account for the lease\nand nonlease components of real estate leases\nand leases of advertising assets, such as\nsignage, as a single lease component. For\nother leased asset classes, lease and nonlease\ncomponents of new lease agreements are\naccounted for separately. In addition, we\nelected the practical expedient to not apply\nthe recognition requirements under the\nstandard to short-term leases. Leases with an\ninitial term of 12 months or less are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize\nlease expense for these leases on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term. Generally, we\nhave elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap\nrate corresponding to the term of the lease at\nthe lease measurement date as our incremental\nborrowing rate to measure the right-of-use-\nasset and lease liability.\nSee Note 7 Leases for additional information\non our leasing arrangements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor financial reporting purposes, we\ndepreciate premises and equipment, net of\nsalvage value, principally using the straight-\nline method over their estimated useful lives.\nWe use estimated useful lives for furniture\nand equipment ranging from oneto 10years, and\ndepreciate buildings over an estimated useful\nlife of up to 40years. We amortize leasehold\nimprovements over their estimated useful lives\nof up to 15years or the respective lease\nterms, whichever is shorter.\nWe purchase, as well as internally develop and\ncustomize, certain software to enhance or\nperform internal business functions. Software\ndevelopment costs incurred in the planning and\npost-development project stages are charged to\nNoninterest expense. Costs associated with\ndesigning software configuration and\ninterfaces, installation, coding programs and\ntesting systems are capitalized and amortized\nusing the straight-line method over periods\nranging from oneto 10years.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 105\nWe review the remaining useful lives and\ncarrying values of premises and equipment to\ndetermine whether an event has occurred that\nwould indicate a change in useful life is\nwarranted or if any impairment exists.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income, on an after-tax\nbasis, primarily consists of unrealized gains\nor losses on available for sale debt\nsecurities, unrealized gains or losses on\nderivatives designated as cash flow hedges,\nand changes in plan assets and benefit\nobligations of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans. Details of each\ncomponent are included in Note 13 Other\nComprehensive Income.\nTreasury Stock\nWe record common stock purchased for treasury\nat cost. At the date of subsequent reissue,\nthe treasury stock account is reduced by the\ncost of such stock on the first-in, first-out\nbasis.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated\nusing the two-class method to determine income\nattributable to common shareholders. Unvested\nshare-based payment awards that contain\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents are considered participating\nsecurities under the two-class method.\nDistributed dividends and dividend equivalents\nrelated to participating securities and an\nallocation of undistributed net income to\nparticipating securities reduce the amount of\nincome attributable to common shareholders. In\na period with a loss, no allocation will be\nmade to the participating securities, as they\ndo not have a contractual obligation to absorb\nlosses. Income attributable to common\nshareholders is then divided by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding for the\nperiod.\nDiluted earnings per common share is\ncalculated under the more dilutive of either\nthe treasury method or the two-class method.\nFor the diluted calculation, we increase the\nweighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding by the assumed conversion of\noutstanding convertible preferred stock from\nthe beginning of the year or date of issuance,\nif later, and the number of shares of common\nstock that would be issued assuming the\nexercise of stock options and warrants and the\nissuance of incentive shares using the\ntreasury stock method. These adjustments to\nthe weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding are made only when\nsuch adjustments will dilute earnings per\ncommon share. For periods in which there is a\nloss from continuing operations, any potential\ndilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this\nscenario, no potential dilutive shares will be\nincluded in the continuing operations,\ndiscontinued operations or total earnings per\ncommon share calculations, even if overall net\nincome is reported. See Note 14 Earnings Per\nShare for additional information.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments and\nthe methods and assumptions used in estimating\nfair value amounts and financial assets and\nliabilities for which fair value was elected\nare detailed in Note 15 Fair Value.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to\nboth mitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risks inherent in\nour business activities, as well as to\nfacilitate customer risk management\nactivities. We manage these risks as part of\nour asset and liability management process and\nthrough credit policies and procedures.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments at\nfair value as either Other assets or Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nand the related cash flows in the Operating\nActivities section of the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for\ncounterparty credit risk are included in the\ndetermination of fair value. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative\ninstrument depends on whether it has been\ndesignated and qualifies as part of a cash\nflow or net investment hedging relationship.\nFor all other derivatives, changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in earnings.\nWe utilize a net presentation for derivative\ninstruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ntaking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash collateral exchanged with counterparties\nis also netted against the applicable\nderivative exposures by offsetting obligations\nto return, or general rights to reclaim, cash\ncollateral against the fair values of the net\nderivatives being collateralized.\nFor those derivative instruments that are\ndesignated and qualify as accounting hedges,\nwe designate the hedging instrument, based on\nthe exposure being hedged, as a fair value\nhedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net\ninvestment in a foreign operation.\nWe formally document the relationship between\nthe hedging instruments and hedged items, as\nwell as the risk management objective and\nstrategy, before undertaking an accounting\nhedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the\nderivatives and related hedged items must be\ndesignated as a hedge at inception of the\nhedge relationship. In addition, a derivative\nmust be highly effective at reducing the risk\nassociated with the exposure being hedged. For\naccounting hedge relationships, we formally\nassess, both at the inception of the hedge\n106 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nand on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives\nare highly effective in offsetting designated\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item. If it is determined that the\nderivative instrument is not highly effective,\nhedge accounting is discontinued. We assess\neffectiveness using statistical regression\nanalysis. Where the critical terms of the\nderivative and hedged item match,\neffectiveness may be assessed qualitatively.\n\nFor derivatives that are designated as fair\nvalue hedges ( i.e ., hedging the exposure to\nchanges in the fair value of an asset or a\nliability attributable to a particular risk,\nsuch as changes in benchmark interest rates),\nchanges in the fair value of the hedging\ninstrument are recognized in earnings and\noffset by also recognizing in earnings the\nchanges in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk. To the extent\nthe change in fair value of the derivative\ndoes not offset the change in fair value of\nthe hedged item, the difference is reflected\nin the Consolidated Income Statement in the\nsame income statement line as the hedged item.\n\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges\n( i.e ., hedging the exposure to variability\nin expected future cash flows), the gain or\nloss on derivatives is reported as a component\nof AOCI and subsequently reclassified to\nincome in the same period or periods during\nwhich the hedged cash flows affect earnings\nand recorded in the same income statement line\nitem as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives\ndesignated as a hedge of net investment in a\nforeign operation, the gain or loss on the\nderivatives is reported as a component of\nAOCI.\n\nWe discontinue hedge accounting when it is\ndetermined that the derivative no longer\nqualifies as an effective hedge; the\nderivative expires or is sold, terminated or\nexercised; or the derivative is de-designated\nas a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a\ncash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that\nthe forecasted transaction will occur by the\nend of the originally specified time period.\n\nWe purchase or originate financial instruments\nthat contain an embedded derivative. For\nfinancial instruments not measured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings, we assess, at inception of the\ntransaction, if the economic characteristics\nof the embedded derivative are clearly and\nclosely related to the economic\ncharacteristics of the host contract, and\nwhether a separate instrument with the same\nterms as the embedded derivative would be a\nderivative. If the embedded derivative is not\nclearly and closely related to the host\ncontract and meets the definition of a\nderivative, the embedded derivative is\nrecorded separately from the host contract\nwith changes in fair value recorded in\nearnings, unless we elect to account for the\nhybrid instrument at fair value.\n\nWe enter into commitments to originate\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans for\nsale. We also enter into commitments to\npurchase or sell commercial and residential\nreal estate loans. These commitments are\naccounted for as free-standing derivatives\nwhich are recorded at fair value in Other\nassets or Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss\nfrom the change in fair value after the\ninception of the commitment is recognized in\nNoninterest income.\n\nSee Note 16 Financial Derivatives for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset\nand liability method. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities and\nare measured using the enacted tax rates and\nlaws that we expect will apply at the time\nwhen we believe the differences will reverse.\nChanges in tax rates and tax law are accounted\nfor in the period of enactment. Thus, at the\nenactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured\nand the change is recognized in Income Tax\nexpense. The recognition of deferred tax\nassets requires an assessment to determine the\nrealization of such assets. Realization refers\nto the incremental benefit achieved through\nthe reduction in future taxes payable or\nrefunds receivable from the deferred tax\nassets, assuming that the underlying\ndeductible differences and carryforwards are\nthe last items to enter into the determination\nof future taxable income. We establish a\nvaluation allowance for tax assets when it is\nmore likely than not that they will not be\nrealized, based upon all available positive\nand negative evidence.\nWe use the proportional amortization method\nfor LIHTC investments, whereby the associated\ninvestment tax credits are recognized as a\nreduction to tax expense. We use the deferral\nmethod of accounting for all other tax credit\ninvestments. Under this method, the investment\ntax credits are recognized as a reduction to\nthe related asset.\nSee Note 19 Income Taxes for additional\ninformation.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe earn interest and noninterest income from\nvarious sources, including:\n\n\u2022 Lending,\n\n\u2022 Securities portfolio,\n\n\u2022 Asset management,\n\n\u2022 Loan sales, loan securitizations, and\nservicing,\n\n\u2022 Brokerage services,\n\n\u2022 Sale of loans and securities,\n\n\u2022 Certain private equity activities, and\n\n\u2022 Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange\nactivities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 107\nIn addition, we earn fees and commissions\nfrom:\n\n\u2022 Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of\ncredit and financial guarantees,\n\n\u2022 Deposit account services,\n\n\u2022 Merchant services,\n\n\u2022 Selling various insurance products,\n\n\u2022 Providing treasury management services\nincluding money transfer services,\n\n\u2022 Providing merger and acquisition advisory\nand related services,\n\n\u2022 Debit and credit card transactions, and\n\n\u2022 Facilitating and participating in certain\ncapital markets transactions.\n\nService charges on deposit accounts are\nrecognized when earned. Brokerage fees and\ngains and losses on the sale of securities and\ncertain derivatives are recognized on a trade-\ndate basis.\n\nWe record private equity income or loss based\non changes in the valuation of the underlying\ninvestments or when we dispose of our\ninterest.\n\nWe recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the\nfair value of certain financial instruments\nwhere we have elected the fair value option.\nThese financial instruments include certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans\noriginated for sale, certain residential\nmortgage portfolio loans and resale\nagreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on\nchanges in the fair value of residential and\ncommercial MSRs.\n\nWe recognize revenue from servicing\nresidential and commercial mortgages for\nothers as earned based on the specific\ncontractual terms. These revenues are reported\non the Consolidated Income Statement in the\nline item Residential and commercial mortgage.\nWe recognize revenue from securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange customer-\nrelated trading, as well as securities\nunderwriting activities, as these transactions\noccur or as services are provided. We\ngenerally recognize gains from the sale of\nloans upon meeting the derecognition criteria\nfor transfers of financial assets. Mortgage\nrevenue recognized is reported net of mortgage\nrepurchase reserves.\n\nFor the fee-based revenue within the scope of\nASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers , revenue is recognized when or as\nthose services are transferred to the\ncustomer. See Note 24 Fee-Based Revenue from\nContracts with Customers for additional\ninformation related to revenue within the\nscope of ASC 606.\nDiscontinued Operations\nA disposal of an asset or business that meets\nthe criteria for held for sale classification\nis reported as discontinued operations when\nthe disposal represents a strategic shift that\nhas had, or will have a major effect on our\noperating results. We report an asset as held\nfor sale when management has approved or\nreceived approval to sell the asset and is\ncommitted to a formal plan, the asset is\navailable for immediate sale, the asset is\nbeing actively marketed, the sale is\nanticipated to occur during the ensuing year\nand certain other specified criteria are met.\nAn asset classified as held for sale is\nrecorded at the lower of its carrying amount\nor estimated fair value less cost to sell. If\nthe carrying amount of the asset exceeds its\nestimated fair value, the asset is written\ndown to its fair value upon the held for sale\ndesignation.\nWhen presenting discontinued operations,\nassets classified as held for sale are\nsegregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ncommencing in the period in which the asset\nmeets all of the held for sale criteria\ndescribed above and prior periods are recast.\nThe results of discontinued operations are\nreported in discontinued operations in the\nConsolidated Income Statement for current and\nprior periods commencing in the period in\nwhich the asset or business is either disposed\nof or is classified as held for sale,\nincluding any gain or loss recognized on the\nsale or adjustment of the carrying amount to\nfair value less cost to sell.\n108 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                                \u2022 ASU         \n                                2020-04 was   \n                                adopted       \n                                March 12,     \n                                2020.

The prices are adjusted\nas\n\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain similar loans.\n\nPersonal installment loans are pooled based on\ndelinquency status, and fair value of\nindividual loans is calculated based on traded\n\nconsumer unsecured loans, dealer research and\nloan level performance characteristics.\n\nAvailable For Sale Securities\n\nAll investment securities from the BBVA\nacquisition were classified within the\navailable for sale portfolio at acquisition.\nFair value\n\nestimates for available for sale securities\nwere determined by third-party pricing\nvendors. The third-party vendors use a variety\nof\n\nmethods when pricing securities that\nincorporate relevant market data to arrive at\nan estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace\n\nwould pay for a security under current market\nconditions. These methods include the use of\nquoted prices for the identical or a similar\n\nsecurity, an alternative market-based approach\nor an income approach, such as a discounted\ncash flow pricing model.\n\nLoans\n\nFair value for loans were based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology that\nconsidered credit loss and prepayment\nexpectations, market interest rates and other\nmarket factors, such as liquidity, from the\nperspective of a market participant. Loan cash\nflows were generated on an individual loan\nbasis. The PD, LGD, exposure at default and\nprepayment assumptions are the key factors\ndriving credit losses which are embedded into\nthe estimated cash flows.\n\n112 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments primarily include LIHTC\ninvestments and preservation fund investments.\nThe fair value of the LIHTC investments\n\nwas estimated based on LIHTC pricing observed\nfor recent transactions in markets where the\nproperties underlying the LIHTC\n\ninvestments from the BBVA acquisition are\nlocated. The fair value of the preservation\ninvestments was estimated based on appraisals\n\nand valuations of the properties in the\ninvestment portfolio using income and market\nprojections.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe fair value of mortgage servicing rights\nfrom the BBVA acquisition is estimated by\nusing a discounted cash flow valuation model\n\nwhich calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows,\ntaking into consideration actual and expected\nmortgage\n\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\n\nCore Deposit Intangible\n\nThis intangible asset represents the value of\ncertain client deposit relationships. The fair\nvalue was estimated utilizing the cost method.\n\nAppropriate consideration was given to deposit\ncosts including servicing costs, client\nretention and alternative funding source costs\nat\n\nthe time of acquisition. The discount rate\nused was derived taking into account the\nestimated cost of equity, risk-free return\nrate and\n\nrisk premium for the market and specific risk\nrelated to the asset\u2019s cash flows. The core\ndeposit intangible is being amortized over\n10years using an accelerated amortization\nmethodology.\n\nDeposits\n\nThe fair values for time deposits were\nestimated by discounting contractual cash\nflows using current market rates for\ninstruments with\n\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, carrying values approximate\nfair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nThe fair values of long-term debt instruments\nwere estimated based on quoted market prices.\nThe following table presents financial results\nof BBVA from the date of acquisition through\nSeptember 30, 2021.

PNC considers a variety of\nfactors in connection with the identification\nof more-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality, including but not limited to\nnonperforming status, delinquency, risk\nratings, TDR classification, FICO scores and\nother qualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. PNC initially measures the\namortized cost of a PCD loan by adding the\nacquisition date estimate of expected credit\nlosses to the loan\u2019s purchase price. The\ninitial ACL for PCD loans of $ 1.1billion was\nestablished through an adjustment to the BBVA\nloan balance and related purchase accounting\nmark.

At December 31, 2022, the accrued interest\nassociated with our held to maturity and\navailable for sale portfolios totaled $\n282million and $ 144million, respectively. The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2021 were $\n5million and $ 322million, respectively. These\namounts are included in Other assetson the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% and 96% were rated AAA/AA as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 142million and is primarily\nrelated to non-agency commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities for securities available for\nsale and $ 7million for securities held to\nmaturity at December 31, 2022. The comparable\namounts at December 31, 2021 were $ 130million\nand $ 3million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held to maturity securities transferred\nfrom available for sale are included in held\nto maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 5.1billion, at December 31, 2022,\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at December 31, 2022\nincluded $ 0.2billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for December 31, 2021\nwas $ 0.8billion.\n\nDuring 2022, we transferred securities with a\nfair value of $ 82.7billion from available for\nsale to held to maturity. The securities\ntransferred included $ 34.0billion of U.S.\nTreasury and government agency securities, $\n39.0billion of agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, $ 6.3billion of asset-\nbacked securities and $ 3.4billion of various\nother security types. The securities were\nreclassified at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer and the transfers represented non-\ncash transactions. AOCI at December 31, 2022\nincluded pretax unrealized losses of $\n5.1billion related to the transfers. These\nunrealized losses will be amortized,\nconsistent with the amortization of the\ndiscount on these securities, over the\nremaining life as an adjustment of yield,\nresulting in no impact to net interest income\nor net income.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb\n\nexpected credit losses on our portfolio. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the allowance for\ninvestment securities was $ 149million and\n\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2021 was $ 133million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 115\nAt December 31, 2022, AOCI included pretax\nlosses of $ 314million from derivatives that\nhedged the purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 48 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at December 31, 2022\nand 2021. These securities are segregated\nbetween investments that had been in a\ncontinuous unrealized loss position for less\nthan twelve months and twelve months or more,\nbased on the point in time that the fair value\ndeclined below the amortized cost basis. All\nsecurities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, we concluded that we do not\nintend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 48: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 52 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance.

Amounts pledged reflect the\nunpaid principal balances.\n\nNonperforming Assets\n\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming\nloans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets.\nNonperforming loans are those loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost whose credit quality has\ndeteriorated to the extent that full\ncollection of contractual principal and\ninterest is not probable and include\nnonperforming TDRs and PCD loans. Interest\nincome is not recognized on these loans. Loans\naccounted for under the fair value option are\nreported as performing loans; however, when\nnonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is\nnot recognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.

See\nNote 1 Accounting Policies and the Troubled\nDebt Restructurings section of this Note 4 for\nadditional information on TDRs.\n\nTotal nonperforming loans in Table 53 include\nTDRs of $ 0.7billion and $ 1.0billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. TDRs\nthat are performing, including consumer credit\ncard TDR loans, are excluded from\nnonperforming loans and totaled $ 0.7billion\nand $ 0.6billion at December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\n\nAdditional Credit Quality Indicators by Loan\nClass\n\nCommercial and Industrial\n\nFor commercial and industrial loans, we\nmonitor the performance of the borrower in a\ndisciplined and regular manner based upon the\nlevel of credit risk inherent in the loan. To\nevaluate the level of credit risk, we assign\nan internal risk rating reflecting the\nborrower\u2019s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional\ncredit risk rating methodology provides\ngranularity in the risk monitoring process.\nThese ratings are generally reviewed and\nupdated at least once per year. For small\nbalance homogeneous pools of commercial and\nindustrial loans and leases, we apply scoring\ntechniques to assist in determining the PD.\nThe combination of the PD and LGD ratings\nassigned to commercial and industrial loans,\ncapturing both the combination of expectations\nof default and loss severity in the event of\ndefault, reflects credit quality\ncharacteristics as of the reporting date and\nare used as inputs into our loss forecasting\nprocess.\n\nBased upon the amount of the lending\narrangement and our risk rating assessment, we\nfollow a formal schedule of written periodic\nreviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews\nof a market\u2019s or business unit\u2019s loan\nportfolio, focusing on those loans which we\nperceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs\nand LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is\nweakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our\npractice to review any customer obligation and\nits level of credit risk more frequently. We\nattempt to proactively manage our loans by\nusing various procedures that are customized\nto the risk of a given loan, including ongoing\noutreach, contact, and assessment of obligor\nfinancial conditions, collateral inspection\nand appraisal.\n\n120 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate projects and commercial\nmortgages similar to commercial and industrial\nloans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks\nassociated with commercial real estate\nprojects and commercial mortgage activities\ntend to be correlated to the loan structure\nand collateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. As a result, these\nattributes are also monitored and utilized in\nassessing credit risk.\n\nAs with the commercial and industrial loan\nclass, a formal schedule of periodic reviews\nis also performed to assess market/geographic\nrisk and business unit/industry risk. Often as\na result of these reviews, more in-depth\nreviews and increased scrutiny are placed on\nareas of higher risk, such as adverse changes\nin risk ratings, deteriorating operating\ntrends, and/or areas that concern management.\nThese reviews are designed to assess risk and\nfacilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\n\nEquipment Lease Financing\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\nequipment lease financing loan class similar\nto commercial and industrial loans by\nanalyzing PD and LGD.\n\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and\nthe level of credit risk, we follow a formal\nschedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this\noccurs quarterly, although we have established\npractices to review such credit risk more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant. Our\nreview process entails analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual\nvalue, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk,\nindustry risk, guarantor requirements and\nregulatory compliance as applicable.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 121\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the commercial loan classes:\nTable 54: Commercial Credit Quality Indicators\n(a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Loans in our commercial portfolio are\nclassified as Pass Rated or Criticized based\non the regulatory definitions, which are\ndriven by the PD and LGD ratings that we\nassign. The Criticized classification includes\nloans that were rated special mention,\nsubstandard or doubtful as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021.\nResidential Real Estate and Home Equity\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators,\nincluding delinquency information,\nnonperforming loan information, updated credit\nscores and originated and updated LTV ratios,\nto monitor and manage credit risk within the\nresidential real estate and home equity loan\nclasses. A summary of credit quality\nindicators follows:\n\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor\ntrending of delinquency/delinquency rates for\nresidential real estate and home equity loans.\nSee Table 55 for additional information.\n\nNonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of\nnonperforming loans for residential real\nestate and home equity loans. See Table 55 for\nadditional information.\n\n122 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nCredit Scores: We use a national third-party\nprovider to update FICO credit scores for\nresidential real estate and home equity loans\nat least quarterly. The updated scores are\nincorporated into a series of credit\nmanagement reports, which are utilized to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and\nsubordinate lien positions): At least\nquarterly, we update the property values of\nreal estate collateral and calculate an\nupdated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines\nsecured by real estate in regions experiencing\nsignificant declines in property values, more\nfrequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV\nmigration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nWe use a combination of original LTV and\nupdated LTV for internal risk management and\nreporting purposes ( e.g. , line management,\nloss mitigation strategies). In addition to\nthe fact that estimated property values by\ntheir nature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that\nupdated LTVs may be based upon management\u2019s\nassumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider,\nHPI changes will be incorporated in arriving\nat management\u2019s estimate of updated LTV).\n\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled\nproperty values. The related estimates and\ninputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation\nmodels, broker price opinions, HPI indices,\nproperty location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and\nmanagement assumptions. We generally utilize\norigination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include\nan amortization assumption when calculating\nupdated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the\ncalculations do not represent actual appraised\nloan level collateral or updated LTV based\nupon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to\nchange as we refine our methodology.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 123\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the residential real estate and\nhome equity loan classes:\n\nTable 55: Credit Quality Indicators for\nResidential Real Estate and Home Equity Loan\nClasses\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n124 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer\n\nWe monitor a variety of credit quality\ninformation in the management of these\nconsumer loan classes. For all loan types, we\ngenerally use a combination of internal loan\nparameters as well as an updated FICO score.\nWe use FICO scores as a primary credit quality\nindicator for automobile and credit card\nloans, as well as non-government guaranteed or\nnon-insured education loans and other secured\nand unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit\nmetrics, such as delinquency status, are\nheavily relied upon as credit quality\nindicators for government guaranteed or\ninsured education loans and consumer loans to\nhigh net worth individuals, as internal credit\nmetrics are more relevant than FICO scores for\nthese types of loans.\n\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency\ntrends and losses for each class, FICO credit\nscore updates are obtained at least quarterly\nalong with a variety of credit bureau\nattributes.

See Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies for additional information related to\nTDRs.\n\nTable 57 quantifies the number of loans that\nwere classified as TDRs as well as the change\nin the loans\u2019 balance as a result of becoming\na TDR during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAdditionally, the table provides information\nabout the types of TDR concessions. The\nPrincipal Forgiveness TDR category includes\nprincipal forgiveness and accrued interest\nforgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category\nincludes reduced interest rate and interest\ndeferral. The Other TDR category primarily\nincludes consumer borrowers that have been\ndischarged from personal liability through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally\nreaffirmed their loan obligations to us, as\nwell as postponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and contractual extensions for\nboth consumer and commercial borrowers.\n\nIn some cases, there have been multiple\nconcessions granted on one loan. This is most\ncommon within the commercial loan portfolio.\nWhen there have been multiple concessions\ngranted in the commercial loan portfolio, the\nprincipal forgiveness concession was\nprioritized for purposes of determining the\ninclusion in Table 57. Second in priority\nwould be rate reduction. In the event that\nmultiple concessions are granted on a consumer\nloan, concessions resulting from discharge\nfrom personal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy without formal affirmation of the\nloan obligations to us would be prioritized\nand included in the Other type of concession\nin Table 57. After that, consumer loan\nconcessions would follow the previously\ndiscussed priority of concessions for the\ncommercial loan portfolio.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 127\nTable 57: Financial Impact and TDRs by\nConcession Type (a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n(a) Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date\nare included in this table.\n(b) Represents the amortized cost basis of the\nloans as of the quarter end prior to TDR\ndesignation.\n(c) Represents the amortized cost basis of the\nTDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the\nTDR occurs.\nAfter a loan is determined to be a TDR, we\ncontinue to track its performance under its\nmost recent restructured terms.

The\ndecline in reserves was primarily driven by\nthe reassessment of pandemic-related risks and\nimprovements in credit quality, partially\noffset by our weakened economic outlook along\nwith loan growth.\n\nN OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nWe have transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement. These transfers have occurred\nthrough Agency securitization, Non-agency\nsecuritization, and loan sale transactions.\nAgency securitizations consist of\nsecuritization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC\nand GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA\nand FHLMC generally securitize our transferred\nloans into mortgage-backed securities for sale\ninto the secondary market through SPEs that\nthey sponsor. As an authorized GNMA\nissuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of\nVA insured loans into mortgage-backed\nsecurities for sale into the secondary market.\nIn Non-agency securitizations, we have\ntransferred loans into securitization SPEs. In\nother instances, third-party investors have\nalso purchased our loans in loan sale\ntransactions and in certain instances have\nsubsequently sold these loans into\nsecuritization SPEs. Securitization SPEs\nutilized in the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization transactions are VIEs.\n\nOur continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC,\nand GNMA securitizations, Non-agency\nsecuritizations, and loan sale transactions\ngenerally consists of servicing, repurchasing\npreviously transferred loans under certain\nconditions and loss share arrangements, and,\nin limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the securitization\nSPEs.\n\nDepending on the transaction, we may act as\nthe master, primary and/or special servicer to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors. Servicing responsibilities\ntypically consist of collecting and remitting\nmonthly borrower principal and interest\npayments, maintaining escrow deposits,\nperforming loss mitigation and foreclosure\nactivities, and, in certain instances, funding\nof servicing advances. Servicing advances,\nwhich are generally reimbursable, are made for\nprincipal and interest and collateral\nprotection and are carried in Other assets at\ncost.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 6 Goodwill and\nMortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair\nValue for further discussion of our servicing\nrights.\n\nCertain loans transferred to the Agencies\ncontain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an\noption to repurchase at par individual\ndelinquent loans that meet certain criteria.\nIn other limited cases, GNMA has granted us\nthe right to repurchase current loans when we\nintend to modify the borrower\u2019s interest rate\nunder established guidelines. When we have the\nunilateral ability to repurchase a loan,\neffective control over the loan has been\nregained and we recognize an asset (in either\nLoans or Loans held for sale) and a\ncorresponding liability (in Other borrowed\nfunds) on the balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan.\n\nThe Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the securitization SPEs\nthat are purchased and held on our balance\nsheet are typically purchased in the secondary\nmarket. We do not retain any credit risk on\nour Agency mortgage-backed security positions\nas FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for\nGNMA) guarantee losses of principal and\ninterest.\n\nWe also have involvement with certain Agency\nand Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs\nwhere we have not transferred commercial\nmortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by\nindependent third-parties and the loans held\nby these entities were purchased exclusively\nfrom other third-parties. Generally, our\ninvolvement with these SPEs is as servicer\nwith servicing activities consistent with\nthose described above.\n\nWe recognize a liability for our loss exposure\nassociated with contractual obligations to\nrepurchase previously transferred loans due to\npossible breaches of representations and\nwarranties and also for loss sharing\narrangements (recourse obligations) with the\nAgencies. Other than providing temporary\nliquidity under servicing advances and our\nloss exposure associated with our repurchase\nand recourse obligations, we have not provided\nnor are we required to provide any type of\ncredit support, guarantees or commitments to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors in these transactions.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 129\nThe following table provides our loan sale and\nservicing activities:\nTable 59: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities\n                                              \n  In                                          \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Cash                                        \n  Flo\u2026                                        \n  -

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 61\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant.

In performing these\nassessments, we evaluate our level of\ncontinuing involvement in these transactions\nas the nature of our involvement ultimately\ndetermines whether or not we hold a variable\ninterest and/or are the primary beneficiary of\nthe SPE. Factors we consider in our\nconsolidation assessment include the\nsignificance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii)\nour holdings of mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the\nrights of third-party variable interest\nholders.\n\nThe first step in our assessment is to\ndetermine whether we hold a variable interest\nin the securitization SPE. We hold variable\ninterests in Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs through our holding of\nresidential and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the SPEs and/or our\nrecourse obligations. Each SPE in which we\nhold a variable interest is evaluated to\ndetermine whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of the entity. For Agency\nsecuritization transactions, our contractual\nrole as servicer does not give us the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly\naffect the economic performance of the SPEs.\nThus, we are not the primary beneficiary of\nthese entities. For Non-agency securitization\ntransactions, we would be the primary\nbeneficiary to the extent our servicing\nactivities give us the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the SPE and we hold a\nmore-than-insignificant variable interest in\nthe entity.\n\nDetails about the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs where we hold a variable\ninterest and are not the primary beneficiary\nare included in Table 61. Our maximum exposure\nto loss as a result of our involvement with\nthese SPEs is the carrying value of the\nmortgage-backed securities, servicing assets,\nservicing advances and our liabilities\nassociated with our recourse obligations.\nCreditors of the securitization SPEs have no\nrecourse to our assets or general credit.\n\nTax Credit Investments and Other\n\nFor tax credit investments in which we do not\nhave the right to make decisions that will\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the entity, we are not the\nprimary beneficiary and thus do not\nconsolidate the entity. These investments are\ndisclosed in Table 61. The table also reflects\nour maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any\npotential tax credit recapture. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is equal to our legally\nbinding equity commitments adjusted for\nrecorded impairment, partnership results or\namortization for qualifying low income housing\ntax credit investments when applicable. For\nall legally binding unfunded equity\ncommitments, we increase our recognized\ninvestment and recognize a liability. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we had a liability for\nunfunded commitments of $ 2.2billion related\nto investments in qualified affordable housing\nprojects which is reflected in Other\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTable 61 also includes our involvement in\nlease financing transactions with LLCs engaged\nin solar power generation that, to a large\nextent, provided returns in the form of tax\ncredits.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.4billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and $ 1.8billion at December\n31, 2021, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages measured at fair value.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of commercial MSRs. Commercial MSRs\nare subject to changes in value from actual or\nexpected prepayment of the underlying loans\nand defaults as well as market driven changes\nin interest rates.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 65 and 66. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 133\nbe extrapolated because the relationship of\nthe change in the assumption to the change in\nfair value may not be linear. Also, the effect\nof a variation in a particular assumption on\nthe fair value of the MSRs is calculated\nindependently without changing any other\nassumption. In reality, changes in one factor\nmay result in changes in another ( e.g. ,\nchanges in mortgage interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rate estimates,\ncould result in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. The three\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\n\u2022 Level 1: Fair value is determined using a\nquoted price in an active market for identical\nassets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and\nliabilities may include debt securities,\nequity securities and listed derivative\ncontracts that are traded in an active\nexchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that are actively traded in over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\n\u2022 Level 2: Fair value is estimated using\ninputs other than quoted prices included\nwithin Level 1 that are observable for assets\nor liabilities, either directly or indirectly.\nThe majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities\ninclude debt securities and listed derivative\ncontracts with quoted prices that are traded\nin markets that are not active, and certain\ndebt and equity securities and over-the-\ncounter derivative contracts whose fair value\nis determined using a pricing model without\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\n\u2022 Level 3: Fair value is estimated using\nunobservable inputs that are significant to\nthe fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities include\nfinancial instruments whose value is\ndetermined using pricing models and discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or similar techniques\nfor which the significant valuation inputs are\nnot observable and the determination of fair\nvalue requires significant management judgment\nor estimation.\n\nWe characterize active markets as those where\ntransaction volumes are sufficient to provide\nobjective pricing information, with reasonably\nnarrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer\nquotes received do not vary widely and are\nbased on current information. Inactive markets\nare typically characterized by low transaction\nvolumes, price quotations that vary\nsubstantially among market participants or are\nnot based on current information, wide bid/ask\nspreads, a significant increase in implied\nliquidity risk premiums, yields, or\nperformance indicators for observed\ntransactions or quoted prices compared to\nhistorical periods, a significant decline or\nabsence of a market for new issuance, or any\ncombination of the above factors. We also\nconsider nonperformance risks, including\ncredit risk, as part of our valuation\nmethodology for all assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value,\nby their nature, result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Assets and\nliabilities classified within Level 3\ninherently require the use of various\nassumptions, estimates and judgments when\nmeasuring their fair value. As observable\nmarket activity is commonly not available to\nuse when estimating the fair value of Level 3\nassets and liabilities, we must estimate fair\nvalue using various modeling techniques. These\ntechniques include the use of a variety of\ninputs/assumptions including credit quality,\nliquidity, interest rates or other relevant\ninputs across the entire population of our\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the\nsignificant underlying factors or assumptions\n(either an increase or a decrease) in any of\nthese areas underlying our estimates may have\nresulted in a significant increase/decrease in\nthe Level 3 fair value measurement of a\nparticular asset and/or liability from period\nto period.\n\nAny models used to determine fair values or to\nvalidate dealer quotes are subject to review\nand independent testing as part of our model\nvalidation and internal control testing\nprocesses. Our Model Risk Management Group\nreviews significant models on at least an\nannual basis. In addition, the Valuation\nCommittee approves valuation methodologies and\nreviews the results of independent valuation\nreviews and processes for assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain residential mortgage\nloans originated for sale at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. The election of the fair\nvalue option aligns the accounting for the\nresidential mortgages with the related hedges.\nResidential mortgage loans are valued based on\nquoted market prices, where available, prices\nfor other traded mortgage loans with similar\ncharacteristics, and purchase commitments and\nbid information received from market\nparticipants. The prices are adjusted as\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain loans that are priced based on the\npricing of similar loans. These adjustments\nrepresent unobservable inputs to the valuation\nbut are not considered significant given the\nrelative insensitivity of the value to changes\nin these inputs to the fair value of the\nloans. Accordingly, the majority of\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale are\nclassified as Level 2.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage\nloans classified as held for sale in whole\nloan transactions at fair value. We determine\nthe fair value of commercial mortgage loans\nheld for sale based upon discounted cash\nflows. Fair value is determined using sale\nvaluation assumptions that management believes\na market participant would use in pricing the\nloans.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 145\nFor loans to be sold to agencies with\nservicing retained, the fair value is adjusted\nfor the estimated servicing cash flows, which\nis an unobservable input. This adjustment is\nnot considered significant given the relative\ninsensitivity of the value to changes in the\ninput to the fair value of the loans.\nAccordingly, commercial mortgage loans held\nfor sale to agencies are classified as Level\n2.\n\nValuation assumptions may include observable\ninputs based on the benchmark interest rate\nswap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales\ntransactions. The significant unobservable\ninput for commercial mortgage loans held for\nsale, excluding those to be sold to agencies,\nis management\u2019s assumption of the spread\napplied to the benchmark rate. The spread over\nthe benchmark curve includes management\u2019s\nassumptions of the impact of credit and\nliquidity risk. Significant increases\n(decreases) in the spread applied to the\nbenchmark would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower (higher) asset value. The\nwide range of the spread over the benchmark\ncurve is due to the varying risk and\nunderlying property characteristics within our\nportfolio. Based on the significance of the\nunobservable input, we classified this\nportfolio as Level 3.\n\nSecurities Available for Sale and Trading\nSecurities\n\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available for sale and trading\nportfolios. We primarily use prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes or recent\ntrades to determine the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of securities were\npriced by third-party vendors. The third-party\nvendors use a variety of methods when pricing\nsecurities that incorporate relevant market\ndata to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer\nin the marketplace would pay for a security\nunder current market conditions. We monitor\nand validate the reliability of vendor pricing\non an ongoing basis through pricing\nmethodology reviews, including detailed\nreviews of the assumptions and inputs used by\nthe vendor to price individual securities, and\nthrough price validation testing. Securities\nnot priced by one of our pricing vendors may\nbe valued using a dealer quote, which are also\nsubject to price validation testing. Price\nvalidation testing is performed independent of\nthe risk-taking function and involves\ncorroborating the prices received from third-\nparty vendors and dealers with prices from\nanother third party or through other sources,\nsuch as internal valuations or sales of\nsimilar securities. Security prices are also\nvalidated through actual cash settlement upon\nsale of a security.\n\nSecurities are classified within the fair\nvalue hierarchy after considering the activity\nlevel in the market for the security type and\nthe observability of the inputs used to\ndetermine the fair value. When a quoted price\nin an active market exists for the identical\nsecurity, this price is used to determine fair\nvalue and the security is classified within\nLevel 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities\ninclude U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nWhen a quoted price in an active market for\nthe identical security is not available, fair\nvalue is estimated using either an alternative\nmarket approach, such as a recent trade or\nmatrix pricing, or an income approach, such as\na discounted cash flow pricing model. If the\ninputs to the valuation are based primarily on\nmarket observable information, then the\nsecurity is classified within Level 2 of the\nhierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency\ndebt securities, agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, agency and non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, certain\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities, asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by non-mortgage-related\ncorporate and consumer loans, and other debt\nsecurities. Level 2 securities are\npredominantly priced by third parties, either\nby a pricing vendor or dealer.\n\nIn certain cases where there is limited\nactivity or less transparency around the\ninputs to the valuation, securities are\nclassified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nSecurities classified as Level 3 consist\nprimarily of non-agency residential mortgage-\nbacked and asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by first- and second-lien\nresidential mortgage loans. Fair value for\nthese securities is primarily estimated using\npricing obtained from third-party vendors. In\nsome cases, fair value is estimated using a\ndealer quote, by reference to prices of\nsecurities of a similar vintage and collateral\ntype or by reference to recent sales of\nsimilar securities. Market activity for these\nsecurity types is limited with little price\ntransparency. As a result, these securities\nare generally valued by the third-party vendor\nusing a discounted cash flow approach that\nincorporates significant unobservable inputs\nand observable market activity where\navailable. Significant inputs to the valuation\ninclude prepayment projections and credit loss\nassumptions (default rate and loss severity)\nand discount rates that are deemed\nrepresentative of current market conditions.\nSignificant increases (decreases) in any of\nthose assumptions in isolation would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nCertain infrequently traded debt securities\nwithin other debt securities available for\nsale and trading securities are also\nclassified in Level 3 and are included in the\nInsignificant Level 3 assets, net of\nliabilities line item in Table 88. The\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to\nestimate the fair value of these securities\ninclude an estimate of expected credit losses\nand a discount for liquidity risk. These\ninputs are incorporated into the fair value\nmeasurement by either increasing the spread\nover the benchmark curve or by applying a\ncredit and liquidity discount to the par value\nof the security. Significant increases\n(decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk\ncould have resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value estimate.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans accounted for at fair value consist\nprimarily of residential mortgage loans. These\nloans are generally valued similarly to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale and\nare classified as Level 2. However, similar to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale, if\nthese loans are repurchased and unsalable,\nthey are classified as Level 3. In addition,\nrepurchased VA loans, where only a portion of\nthe principal will be reimbursed, are\nclassified as Level 3. The fair value is\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation based on our historical loss rate.\nWe have elected to account for certain home\nequity lines of credit at fair value. These\nloans are classified as\n\n146 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nLevel 3. Significant inputs to the valuation\nof these loans include credit and liquidity\ndiscount, cumulative default rate, loss\nseverity and gross discount rate and are\ndeemed representative of current market\nconditions. Significant increases (decreases)\nin any of these assumptions would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments includes money market\nmutual funds as well as direct and indirect\nprivate equity investments. Money market\nmutual funds are valued based on quoted prices\nin active markets for identical securities and\nclassified within Level 1 of the hierarchy.\nThe valuation of direct and indirect private\nequity investments requires significant\nmanagement judgment due to the absence of\nquoted market prices, inherent lack of\nliquidity and the long-term nature of such\ninvestments. Various valuation techniques are\nused for direct investments, including\nmultiples of adjusted earnings of the entity,\nindependent appraisals, anticipated financing\nand sale transactions with third parties, or\nthe pricing used to value the entity in a\nrecent financing transaction. A multiple of\nadjusted earnings calculation is the valuation\ntechnique utilized most frequently and is the\nmost significant unobservable input used in\nsuch calculation. Significant decreases\n(increases) in the multiple of earnings could\nhave resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement. Direct equity\ninvestments are classified as Level 3.\n\nIndirect investments are not redeemable;\nhowever, we receive distributions over the\nlife of the partnerships from liquidation of\nthe underlying investments by the investee,\nwhich we expect to occur over the next\n12years. We value indirect investments in\nprivate equity funds using the NAV practical\nexpedient as provided in the financial\nstatements that we receive from fund managers.\nDue to the time lag in our receipt of the\nfinancial information and based on a review of\ninvestments and valuation techniques applied,\nadjustments to the manager-provided value are\nmade when available recent portfolio company\ninformation or market information indicates a\nsignificant change in value from that provided\nby the manager of the fund. Indirect\ninvestments valued using NAV are not\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\n\nMSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs\nvaluation model reflect management\u2019s best\nestimate of factors that a market participant\nwould use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales\nof MSRs do occur and can offer some market\ninsight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open\nmarket with readily observable prices so the\nprecise terms and conditions of sales are not\navailable.\n\nResidential MSRs\n\nAs a benchmark for the reasonableness of our\nresidential MSRs fair value, we obtained\nopinions of value from independent brokers.\nThese brokers provided a range (+/- 10bps)\nbased upon their own discounted cash flow\ncalculations of our portfolio that reflect\nconditions in the secondary market and any\nrecently executed servicing transactions. We\ncompare our internally-developed residential\nMSRs value to the ranges of values received\nfrom the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair\nvalue falls outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges,\nmanagement will assess whether a valuation\nadjustment is warranted. For the periods\npresented, our residential MSRs value did not\nfall outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges.\n\nDue to the nature of the unobservable\nvaluation inputs, residential MSRs are\nclassified as Level 3. The significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of residential MSRs are constant\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve. Significant increases (decreases) in\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve would have resulted in lower (higher)\nfair market value of residential MSRs.\n\nCommercial MSRs\n\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated\nby using a discounted cash flow model\nincorporating unobservable inputs for\nassumptions such as constant prepayment rates,\ndiscount rates and other factors. Due to the\nnature of the unobservable valuation inputs\nand the limited availability of market\npricing, commercial MSRs are classified as\nLevel 3. Significant increases (decreases) in\nconstant prepayment rates and discount rates\nwould have resulted in significantly lower\n(higher) commercial MSR value determined based\non current market conditions and expectations.\n\nFinancial Derivatives\n\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued using\nquoted market prices and are classified as\nLevel 1. The majority of derivatives that we\nenter into are executed over-the-counter and\nare valued using internal models. These\nderivatives are primarily classified as Level\n2, as the readily observable market inputs to\nthese models are validated to external\nsources, such as industry pricing services, or\nare corroborated through recent trades, dealer\nquotes, yield curves, implied volatility or\nother market-related data. Level 2 financial\nderivatives are primarily estimated using\nobservable benchmark interest rate swaps to\nconstruct projected discounted cash flows.\n\nFinancial derivatives that are priced using\nsignificant management judgment or assumptions\nare classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs\nrelated to interest rate contracts include\nprobability of funding of residential mortgage\nloan commitments and estimated servicing cash\nflows of commercial and residential mortgage\nloan commitments. Probability of default and\nloss severity are the significant unobservable\ninputs used in the valuation of risk\nparticipation agreements. The fair values of\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities related to\nthese interest rate contract financial\nderivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\nare included in the Insignificant Level 3\nassets, net of liabilities line item in Table\n88 of this Note 15.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 147\nIn connection with the sales of portions of\nour Visa Class B common shares, we entered\ninto swap agreements with the purchasers of\nthe shares to retain any future risk of\ndecreases in the conversion rate of Class B\ncommon shares to Class A common shares\nresulting from increases in the escrow funded\nby Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of\nthe pending interchange litigation (see Note\n21 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also\nrequire PNC to make periodic payments based on\nthe market price of the Class A common shares\nat a fixed rate of interest (in certain cases\nsubject to step-up provisions) until the Visa\nlitigation is resolved. An increase in the\nestimated length of litigation resolution\ndate, a decrease in the estimated conversion\nrate, or an increase in the estimated growth\nrate of the Class A share price would have had\na negative impact on the fair value of the\nswaps and vice versa.\n\nThe fair values of our derivatives include a\ncredit valuation adjustment to reflect our own\nand our counterparties\u2019 nonperformance risk.\nOur credit valuation adjustment is computed\nusing credit default swap spreads, in\nconjunction with internal historical recovery\nobservations.\n\nOther Assets and Liabilities\n\nOther assets held at fair value on a recurring\nbasis primarily include assets related to\nPNC\u2019s deferred compensation and supplemental\nincentive savings plans.\n\nThe assets related to PNC\u2019s deferred\ncompensation and supplemental incentive\nsavings plans primarily consist of a prepaid\nforward contract referencing an amount of\nshares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and\nfixed income funds, and are valued based on\nthe underlying investments. These assets are\nvalued either by reference to the market price\nof PNC\u2019s stock or by using the quoted market\nprices for investments other than PNC\u2019s stock\nand are included in Levels 1 and 2.\n\nAll Level 3 other assets and liabilities are\nincluded in the Insignificant Level 3 assets,\nnet of liabilities line item in Table 88 in\nthis Note 15.\n\nOther Borrowed Funds\n\nOther borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S.\nTreasury securities sold short which are\nclassified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds\nalso includes the related liability for\ncertain repurchased loans for which we have\nelected the fair value option and are\nclassified as either Level 2 or Level 3,\nconsistent with the level classification of\nthe corresponding loans.

These adjustments to fair\nvalue usually result from the application of\nlower of amortized cost or fair value\naccounting or write-downs of individual assets\ndue to impairment and are included in Table\n89.\n\nNonaccrual Loans\n\nThe carrying value of nonaccrual loans\nrepresents the fair value of those loans which\nhave been adjusted due to impairment. The\nimpairment is primarily based on the appraised\nvalue of the collateral.\n\nAppraisals are obtained by licensed or\ncertified appraisers at least annually and\nmore recently in certain instances. All third-\nparty appraisals are reviewed and any\nadjustments to the initial appraisal are\nincorporated into the final issued appraisal\nreport. In instances where an appraisal is not\nobtained, collateral value is determined\nconsistent with external third-party appraisal\nstandards by an internal person independent of\nthe asset manager.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nThe majority of the amounts below for equity\ninvestments represent the carrying value of\nLIHTC investments held for sale calculated\nusing a discounted cash flow model. The\nsignificant unobservable input is management\u2019s\nestimate of required market rate of return.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 153\nThe market rate of return is based on\ncomparison to recent LIHTC sales in the\nmarket. Significant increases (decreases) in\nthis input would result in a significantly\nlower (higher) carrying value of the\ninvestments.\n\nOREO and Foreclosed Assets\n\nThe carrying value of OREO and foreclosed\nassets includes valuation adjustments recorded\nsubsequent to the transfer to OREO and\nforeclosed assets. These valuation adjustments\nare based on the fair value less cost to sell\nof the property. Fair value is based on\nappraised value or sales price and the\nappraisal process for OREO and foreclosed\nassets is the same as described above for\nnonaccrual loans.\n\nLong-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets consists of buildings for\nwhich valuation adjustments were recorded\nduring the period. A facility classified as\nheld for use is impaired to the extent its\ncarrying value is not recoverable and exceeds\nfair value. Valuation adjustments on buildings\nheld for sale are based on the fair value of\nthe property less an estimated cost to sell\nand are recorded subsequent to the transfer of\nthe asset to held for sale status. Fair value\nis determined either by a third-party\nappraisal, recent sales offer, changes in\nmarket or property conditions or, where we\nhave agreed to sell the building to a third\nparty, the contractual sales price. Impairment\non these long-lived assets is recorded in\nOther noninterest expense on our Consolidated\nIncome Statement.\nAssets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis are as follows:\nTable 89: Fair Value Measurements \u2013\nNonrecurring (a) (b) (c)\n                                              \n                 \u2026                            \n                 \u2026           \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                      $           \u2026      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                  \u2026           \n                      $           \u2026      $    \n                                              \n(a) All Level 3 for the periods presented,\nexcept for $ 42million included in Equity\ninvestments which was categorized as Level 1\nas of December 31, 2022.\n(b) Valuation techniques applied were fair\nvalue of property or collateral.\n(c) Unobservable inputs used were appraised\nvalue/sales price, broker opinions or\nprojected income/required improvement costs.\nAdditional quantitative information was not\nmeaningful for the periods presented.\nFinancial Instruments Accounted for under Fair\nValue Option\n\nWe elect the fair value option to account for\ncertain financial instruments.

We used the following methods\nand assumptions to estimate the fair value\namounts for these financial instruments.\n\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning\nDeposits with Banks\n\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying\namounts for Cash and due from banks and\nInterest-earning deposits with banks reported\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate\nfair value.\n\nSecurities Held to Maturity\n\nWe primarily use prices obtained from pricing\nservices, dealer quotes or recent trades to\ndetermine the fair value of securities. Refer\nto the Fair Value Measurement section of this\nNote 15 for additional information relating to\nour pricing processes and procedures.\n\nNet Loans\n\nFair values are estimated based on the\ndiscounted value of expected net cash flows\nincorporating assumptions about prepayment\nrates, net credit losses and servicing fees.\nNonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated\nrecovery value. The carrying value of Net\nloans are presented net of the ALLL.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 155\nOther Assets\n\nThe carrying value of Other assets, which\ninclude accrued interest receivable, cash\ncollateral, federal funds sold and resale\nagreements, certain loans held for sale, and\nFHLB and FRB stock, approximates fair value.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and\nFRB stock was $ 2.5billion and $ 1.3billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nDeposits\n\nFor time deposits, fair values are estimated\nby discounting contractual cash flows using\ncurrent market rates for instruments with\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing\nand interest-bearing demand and interest-\nbearing money market and savings deposits,\ncarrying values approximate fair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nFor short-term borrowed funds, including\nfederal funds purchased, commercial paper,\nrepurchase agreements and certain other short-\nterm borrowings and payables, carrying value\napproximates fair value. For long-term\nborrowed funds, quoted market prices are used,\nwhen available, to estimate fair value.

Any\nnonperformance risk, including credit risk, is\nincluded in the determination of the estimated\nnet fair value of the derivatives. Further\ndiscussion on how derivatives are accounted\nfor is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk as part of our\nasset and liability risk management activities\nare designated as accounting hedges.\nDerivatives hedging the risks associated with\nchanges in the fair value of assets or\nliabilities are considered fair value hedges,\nderivatives hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are considered cash\nflow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net\ninvestment in a foreign subsidiary are\nconsidered net investment hedges. Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow December 31,\n2022, we expect to reclassify net derivative\nlosses of $ 1.4billion pretax, or $ 1.1billion\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to December 31,\n2022. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is ten years.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n

Carrying value shown represents amortized\ncost.\nNet Investment Hedges\n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward\ncontracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries against\nadverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We\nassess whether the hedging relationship is\nhighly effective in achieving offsetting\nchanges in the value of the hedge and hedged\nitem by qualitatively verifying that the\ncritical terms of the hedge and hedged item\nmatch at the inception of the hedging\nrelationship and on an ongoing basis. Net\ninvestment hedge derivatives are classified as\nforeign exchange contracts. There were\nnocomponents of derivative gains or losses\nexcluded from the assessment of the hedge\neffectiveness for the periods presented. Net\ngains on net investment hedge derivatives\nrecognized in OCI were $ 119million in 2022\nand insignificant in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n160 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging\nInstruments\n\nResidential mortgage loans that will be sold\nin the secondary market, and the related loan\ncommitments, which are considered derivatives,\nare accounted for at fair value. Changes in\nthe fair value of the loans and commitments\ndue to interest rate risk are hedged with\nforward contracts to sell mortgage-backed\nsecurities, as well as U.S. Treasury and\nEurodollar futures and options. Gains and\nlosses on the loans and commitments held for\nsale and the derivatives used to economically\nhedge them are included in Residential and\ncommercial mortgage noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\n\nResidential mortgage servicing rights are\naccounted for at fair value with changes in\nfair value influenced primarily by changes in\ninterest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the\nfair value of residential mortgage servicing\nrights include interest rate futures, swaps,\noptions, and forward contracts to purchase\nmortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses\non residential mortgage servicing rights and\nthe related derivatives used for hedging are\nincluded in Residential and commercial\nmortgage noninterest income.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nthe related loan commitments, which are\nconsidered derivatives, are accounted for at\nfair value. Derivatives used to economically\nhedge these loans and commitments from changes\nin fair value due to interest rate risk\ninclude forward loan sale contracts and\ninterest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the\ncommitments, loans and derivatives are\nincluded in Residential and commercial\nmortgage noninterest income. Derivatives used\nto economically hedge the change in value of\ncommercial mortgage servicing rights include\ninterest rate futures, swaps and options.\nGains or losses on these derivatives are\nincluded in Residential and commercial\nmortgage noninterest income.\n\nThe residential and commercial mortgage loan\ncommitments associated with loans to be sold\nwhich are accounted for as derivatives are\nvalued based on the estimated fair value of\nthe underlying loan and the probability that\nthe loan will fund within the terms of the\ncommitment. The fair value also takes into\naccount the fair value of the embedded\nservicing right.\n\nWe offer derivatives to our customers in\nconnection with their risk management needs.\nThese derivatives primarily consist of\ninterest rate swaps, interest rate caps and\nfloors, swaptions and foreign exchange\ncontracts. We primarily manage our market risk\nexposure from customer transactions by\nentering into a variety of hedging\ntransactions with third-party dealers. Gains\nand losses on customer-related derivatives are\nincluded in Other noninterest income.\n\nIncluded in the customer, mortgage banking\nrisk management, and other risk management\nportfolios are written interest-rate caps and\nfloors entered into with customers and for\nrisk management purposes. We receive an\nupfront premium from the counterparty and are\nobligated to make payments to the counterparty\nif the underlying market interest rate rises\nabove or falls below a certain level\ndesignated in the contract. Our ultimate\nobligation under written options is based on\nfuture market conditions.\n\nWe have entered into risk participation\nagreements to share some of the credit\nexposure with other counterparties related to\ninterest rate derivative contracts or to take\non credit exposure to generate revenue.

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nCollateral is typically exchanged daily on\nunsettled positions based on the net fair\nvalue of the positions with the counterparty\nas of the preceding day. Collateral\nrepresenting initial margin, which is based on\npotential future exposure, may also be\nrequired to be exchanged. In certain cases,\nminimum thresholds must be exceeded before any\ncollateral is exchanged. Any cash collateral\nexchanged with counterparties under these\nmaster netting agreements is also netted, when\nappropriate, against the applicable derivative\nfair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nHowever, the fair value of any securities held\nor pledged is not included in the net\npresentation on the balance sheet. In order\nfor derivative instruments under a master\nnetting agreement to be eligible for closeout\nnetting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient\nlegal review to conclude with a well-founded\nbasis that the offsetting rights included in\nthe master netting agreement would be legally\nenforceable upon an event of default,\nincluding upon an event of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, or a similar proceeding of the\ncounterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a\nlegal opinion that supports, with sufficient\nconfidence, the enforceability of the master\nnetting agreement in such circumstances.\n\nTable 98 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021. The table\nincludes cash collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nThe table also includes the fair value of any\nsecurities collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash and securities collateral amounts are\nincluded in the table only to the extent of\nthe related net derivative fair values.\n\nTable 98 includes OTC derivatives not settled\nthrough an exchange (\u201cOTC derivatives\u201d) and\nOTC derivatives cleared through a central\nclearing house (\u201cOTC cleared derivatives\u201d).\nOTC derivatives represent contracts executed\nbilaterally with counterparties that are not\nsettled through an organized exchange or\ndirectly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house who then becomes our\ncounterparty. OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\n\n162 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\nTable 98: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, cash and debt securities\n(primarily agency mortgage-backed securities)\ntotaling $ 1.5billion were pledged to us under\nmaster netting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements, and we pledged\ncash and debt securities (primarily agency\nmortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n2.5billion under these agreements to\ncollateralize net derivative liabilities owed\nto counterparties and to meet initial margin\nrequirements. These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions.

Benefits are determined using a\ncash balance formula where earnings credits\nare a percentage of eligible compensation.\nEarnings credit percentages for those\nemployees who were plan participants on\nDecember 31, 2009 are frozen at the level\nearned to that point. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who became participants on or after\nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible\ncompensation. All participants as of December\n31, 2009 earn a minimum rate on their cash\nbalances; new participants on or after January\n1, 2010 earn interest credits on their cash\nbalances based on 30-year Treasury securities.\nNew participants on or after January 1, 2010\nare not subject to the minimum rate. The plan\nprovides for a minimum annual earnings credit\namount of $ 2,000, subject to eligibility\ncriteria. Pension contributions to the plan\nare typically based on an actuarially\ndetermined amount necessary to fund total\nbenefits payable to plan participants. Assets\nof the qualified pension plan are held in a\nseparate Trust.\n\nWe also maintain nonqualified supplemental\nretirement plans for certain employees and\nprovide certain health care and life insurance\nbenefits for qualifying retired employees\n(postretirement benefits) through various\nplans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or\nmake changes to these plans at any time. The\nnonqualified pension plan is unfunded.\nContributions from PNC, and participant\ncontributions in the case of the\npostretirement benefit plans, cover all\nbenefits paid under the nonqualified pension\nplan and postretirement benefit plans. The\npostretirement plan provides benefits to\ncertain retirees that are at least actuarially\nequivalent to those provided by Medicare Part\nD and accordingly, we receive a federal\nsubsidy.

Certain domestic equity\ninvestment managers utilize derivatives and\nfixed income securities as described in their\nInvestment Management Agreements to achieve\ntheir investment objective under the\nInvestment Policy Statement. Other investment\nmanagers may invest in eligible securities\noutside of their assigned asset category to\nmeet their investment objectives. The actual\npercentage of the fair value of total Plan\nassets held as of December 31, 2022 for equity\nsecurities, fixed income securities, real\nestate and all other assets are 63%, 24%, 6%\nand 7%, respectively.\n\nWe believe that, over the long term, asset\nallocation is the single greatest determinant\nof risk. Asset allocation will deviate from\nthe target percentages due to market movement,\ncash flows, investment manager performance and\nimplementation of shifts under the dynamic\nasset allocation policy. Material deviations\nfrom the asset allocation targets can alter\nthe expected return and risk of the Trust.\nHowever, frequent rebalancing of the asset\nallocation targets may result in significant\ntransaction costs, which can impair the\nTrust\u2019s ability to meet its investment\nobjective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is\nperiodically rebalanced to maintain asset\nallocation within the target ranges described\nabove.\n\nIn addition to being diversified across asset\nclasses, the Trust is diversified within each\nasset class. Secondary diversification\nprovides a reasonable basis for the\nexpectation that no single security or class\nof securities will have a disproportionate\nimpact on the total risk and return of the\nTrust.\n\nWhere investment strategies permit the use of\nderivatives and/or currency management,\nlanguage is incorporated in the managers\u2019\nguidelines to define allowable and prohibited\ntransactions and/or strategies. Derivatives\nare typically employed by investment managers\nto modify risk/return characteristics of their\nportfolio(s), implement asset allocation\nchanges in a cost effective manner, or reduce\ntransaction costs. Under the managers\u2019\ninvestment guidelines, derivatives may not be\nused solely for speculation or leverage.\nDerivatives are to be used only in\ncircumstances where they offer the most\nefficient economic means of improving the\nrisk/reward profile of the portfolio.\n\n166 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nAs further described in Note 15 Fair Value,\nGAAP establishes the framework for measuring\nfair value, including a hierarchy used to\nclassify the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue.\nA description of the valuation methodologies\nused for assets measured at fair value at both\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 follows:\nTable 102: Pension Plan Valuation\nMethodologies\n                                              \n                         Valuation            \n                         Methodology          \n                         \u2022 Valued at the NAV  \n                         of the shares held   \n  Asset                  by the pension plan  \n  Money market funds     at year end.         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                         \u2022 Valued at the      \n                         closing price        \n                         reported on the      \n                         active market on     \n                         which the            \n                         individual           \n                         securities are       \n                         traded.              \n                         \u2022 If quoted market   \n                         prices are not       \n                         available for the    \n                         specific security,   \n                         then fair values     \n  U.S. government and    are estimated by     \n  agency securities      using pricing        \n  Corporate debt         models or quoted     \n  Common stock           prices of            \n                         securities with      \n                         similar              \n                         characteristics.     \n                         Such securities are  \n                         generally            \n                         classified within    \n                         Level 2 of the       \n                         valuation hierarchy  \n                         but may be a Level   \n                         3 depending on the   \n                         level of liquidity   \n                         and activity in the  \n                         market for the       \n                         security.            \n                         \u2022 Valued based on    \n                         third-party pricing  \n  Mutual funds           of the fund that is  \n                         not actively         \n                         traded.              \n                         \u2022 Derivative         \n                         financial            \n                         instruments -

   \n(a) Rate disclosed is for the qualified\npension plan.\n(b) Rate is applicable only to the\npostretirement benefit plans.\nThe discount rates are determined\nindependently for each plan by comparing the\nexpected future benefits that will be paid\nunder each plan with yields available on high\nquality corporate bonds of similar duration.\nFor this analysis, 10% of bonds with the\nhighest yields and 40% with the lowest yields\nwere removed from the bond universe.\n\nWith all other assumptions held constant, a\n0.50% decline in the discount rate would have\nresulted in an immaterial change in net\nperiodic benefit cost in 2022 and to be\nrecognized in 2023 for each of the qualified\npension, nonqualified pension and\npostretirement benefit plans.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-\nterm assumption established by considering\nhistorical and anticipated returns of the\nasset classes invested in by the pension plan\nand the allocation strategy currently in place\namong those classes. For purposes of setting\nand reviewing this assumption, \u201clong-term\u201d\nrefers to the period over which the plan\u2019s\nprojected benefit obligations will be\ndisbursed. We review this assumption at each\nmeasurement date and adjust it if warranted.\nOur selection process references certain\nhistorical data and the current environment,\nbut primarily utilizes qualitative judgment\nregarding future return expectations. We also\nexamine the assumption used by other companies\nwith similar pension investment strategies.\nTaking into account all of these factors, the\nexpected\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 169\nlong-term return on plan assets for\ndetermining net periodic pension cost for 2022\nwas 4.50%. We are increasing our expected\nlong-term return on assets to 6.20% for\ndetermining pension cost for 2023. This\ndecision was made after considering the views\nof both internal and external capital market\nadvisors, particularly with regard to the\neffects of the recent economic environment on\nlong-term prospective equity and fixed income\nreturns.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nThe ISP is a qualified defined contribution\nplan that covers all of our eligible\nemployees. Newly-hired full time employees and\npart-time employees who are eligible to\nparticipate in the ISP are automatically\nenrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal\nto 4% of eligible compensation in the absence\nof an affirmative election otherwise. Employee\nbenefits expense related to the ISP was $\n175million in 2022, $ 168million in 2021 and $\n147million in 2020, representing cash\ncontributed to the ISP by PNC.\n\nThe ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an\nemployee stock ownership feature. Employee\ncontributions are invested in a number of\ninvestment options, including pre-mixed\nportfolios and individual core funds,\navailable under the ISP at the direction of\nthe employee.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  18 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  TOCK B ASED C OMPENSATION P LANS            \n                                              \nWe have long-term incentive award plans\n(Incentive Plans) that provide for the\ngranting of incentive stock options,\nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, performance share units, restricted\nshare units, other share-based awards and\ndollar-denominated awards to executives and,\nother than incentive stock options, to non-\nemployee directors. Certain Incentive Plan\nawards may be paid in stock, cash or a\ncombination of stock and cash. We typically\ngrant a substantial portion of our stock-based\ncompensation awards during the first quarter\nof each year.\n\nPerformance Share Unit Awards and Restricted\nShare Unit Awards\n\nPNC grants share unit awards that are based on\nperformance, service and certain metrics tied\nto market conditions. The fair value of\nnonvested performance share unit awards and\nrestricted share unit awards is initially\ndetermined based on prices not less than the\nmarket value of our common stock on the date\nof grant with a reduction for estimated\nforfeitures. Fair value is determined based on\na Monte Carlo model, with subsequent\nremeasurement based on the achievement of one\nor more performance goals. Additionally,\ncertain performance share unit awards could\nrequire subsequent adjustment due to certain\ndiscretionary risk review triggers.\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of\nperformance share unit awards and restricted\nshare unit awards granted in 2022, 2021 and\n2020 was $ 198.28, $ 161.04and $ 150.23per\nshare, respectively. The total intrinsic value\nof performance share unit awards and\nrestricted share unit awards vested during\n2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $\n322million, $ 207million and $ 213million,\nrespectively.

Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nIn our experience, legal proceedings are\ninherently unpredictable. One or more of the\nfollowing factors frequently contribute to\nthis inherent unpredictability: the proceeding\nis in its early stages; the damages sought are\nunspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is\nunclear whether a case brought as a class\naction will be allowed to proceed on that\nbasis or, if permitted to proceed as a class\naction, how the class will be defined; the\nother party is seeking relief other than or in\naddition to compensatory damages (including,\nin the case of regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations and inquiries, the possibility\nof fines and penalties); the matter presents\nmeaningful legal uncertainties, including\nnovel issues of law; we have not engaged in\nmeaningful settlement discussions; discovery\nhas not started or is not complete; there are\nsignificant facts in dispute; the possible\noutcomes may not be amenable to the use of\nstatistical or quantitative analytical tools;\npredicting possible outcomes depends on making\nassumptions about future decisions of courts\nor regulatory bodies or the behavior of other\nparties; and there are a large number of\nparties named as defendants (including where\nit is uncertain how damages or liability, if\nany, will be shared among multiple\ndefendants). Generally, the less progress that\nhas been made in the proceedings or the\nbroader the range of potential results, the\nharder it is for us to estimate losses or\nranges of losses that it is reasonably\npossible we could incur.\n\nAs a result of these types of factors, we are\nunable, at this time, to estimate the losses\nthat are reasonably possible to be incurred or\nranges of such losses with respect to some of\nthe matters disclosed, and the aggregate\nestimated amount provided above does not\ninclude an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nBeginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust\nlawsuits were filed against Visa \u00ae ,\nMastercard \u00ae , and several major financial\ninstitutions, including cases naming National\nCity (since merged into The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary,\nNational City Bank of Kentucky (since merged\ninto National City Bank, which, in turn, was\nmerged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these\ncases are merchants operating commercial\nbusinesses throughout the U.S., as well as\ntrade associations. Some of these cases\n(including those naming National City\nentities) were brought as class actions on\nbehalf of all persons or business entities\nthat have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The\ncases have been consolidated for pre-trial\nproceedings in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of New York under the caption\nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and\nMerchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master\nFile No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JO).\n\nIn July 2012, the parties entered into a\nmemorandum of understanding with the class\nplaintiffs and an agreement in principle with\ncertain individual plaintiffs with respect to\na settlement of these cases, under which the\ndefendants agreed to pay approximately $\n6.6billion collectively to the class and\nindividual settling plaintiffs and agreed to\nchanges in the terms applicable to their\nrespective card networks (including an eight-\nmonth reduction in default credit interchange\nrates). The parties entered into a definitive\nagreement with respect to this settlement in\nOctober 2012. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement in December 2013. Several\nobjectors appealed the order of approval to\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit, which issued an order in June 2016,\nreversing approval of the settlement and\nremanding for further proceedings. In November\n2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court\nto challenge the court of appeal\u2019s decision.\nThe Supreme Court denied the petition in March\n2017.\n\nAs a result of the reversal of the approval of\nthe settlement, the class actions have resumed\nin the district court. In November 2016, the\ndistrict court appointed separate interim\nclass counsel for a proposed class seeking\ndamages and a proposed class seeking equitable\n(injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of\nthese counsel filed a proposed amended and\nsupplemental complaint on behalf of its\nrespective proposed class. These complaints\nmake similar allegations, including that the\ndefendants conspired to monopolize and to fix\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 175\nthe prices for general purpose card network\nservices, that the restructuring of Visa and\nMastercard, each of which included an initial\npublic offering, violated the antitrust laws,\nand that the defendants otherwise imposed\nunreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in\nthe payment of inflated interchange fees and\nother fees, which also violated the antitrust\nlaws. In their complaints, collectively the\nplaintiffs seek, among other things,\ninjunctive relief, unspecified damages\n(trebled under the antitrust laws) and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. PNC is named as a defendant\nin the complaint seeking damages but is not\nnamed as a defendant in the complaint that\nseeks equitable relief.\n\nIn September 2017, the magistrate judge at the\ndistrict court granted in part and denied in\npart the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to file their\nproposed amended complaints. The dispute over\namendment arose in part from the decision in\nUnited States v. American Express, Co., 838\nF.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), in which the court\nheld that the relevant market in a similar\ncomplaint against American Express is \u201ctwo-\nsided,\u201d i.e ., requires consideration of\neffects on consumers as well as merchants. In\nJune 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed\n(under the caption Ohio v. American Express\nCo. ) the court of appeals decision .\nPreviously, the plaintiffs in this litigation\nhad alleged a one-sided market, and, as a\nresult of the court\u2019s decision in American\nExpress , they sought leave to add claims\nbased on a two-sided market. The order allowed\nthe complaint to be amended to include\nallegations pertaining to a two-sided market\nonly to the extent those claims are not time-\nbarred, but held that the two-sided market\nallegations do not relate back to the time of\nthe original complaint and are not subject to\ntolling. In October 2017, the plaintiffs\nappealed this order to the presiding district\ncourt judge. In August 2018, the judge\noverruled this decision, finding that the two-\nsided market allegations do relate back.\n\nIn September 2018, the relevant parties\nentered an amended definitive agreement to\nresolve the claims of the class seeking\ndamages. In this amended settlement agreement,\nthe parties agreed, among other things, to the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\u2022 An additional settlement payment from all\ndefendants of $ 900million, with Visa\u2019s share\nof the additional settlement payment being $\n600million. The additional settlement payment\nwill be added to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously paid by the defendants\npursuant to the original 2012 settlement\nagreement.\n\n\u2022 Up to $ 700million may be returned to the\ndefendants (with up to $ 467million to Visa)\nif more than 15% of class members (by payment\nvolume) opt out of the class. As more than 15%\nof class members opted out of the class, $\n700million has been returned to the defendants\n($ 467million to Visa).\n\nThis amended settlement agreement is subject\nto court approval. Following preliminary\napproval in January 2019, and after class\nnotice, the submission of opt-outs, and the\nfiling of objections, the district court\ngranted final approval of the settlement in\nDecember 2019. Several objectors have appealed\nthe district court\u2019s order granting final\napproval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. Oral argument of this appeal\nwas held on March 16, 2022. Some merchants\nthat opted out from the settlement have\nbrought lawsuits against Visa and Mastercard\nand one or more of the issuing banks.\nResolution by Visa of claims by merchants that\nopted out of the settlement, including those\nthat file lawsuits, have been or will be paid\nfrom the Visa litigation escrow account.\n\nNational City and National City Bank entered\ninto judgment and loss sharing agreements with\nVisa and certain other banks with respect to\nall of the above referenced litigation. We\nwere not originally named as defendants in any\nof the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust\nlitigation nor were we initially parties to\nthe judgment or loss sharing agreements.\nHowever, we became responsible for National\nCity\u2019s and National City Bank\u2019s position in\nthe litigation and responsibilities under the\nagreements through our acquisition of National\nCity. In addition, following Visa\u2019s\nreorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its\ninitial public offering, U.S. Visa members\nreceived shares of Class B Visa common stock,\nconvertible upon resolution of specified\nlitigation, including the remaining litigation\ndescribed above, into shares of Class A Visa\ncommon stock, with the conversion rate\nadjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed\nto resolve the specified litigation, and also\nremained responsible for indemnifying Visa\nagainst the specified litigation. Our Class B\nVisa common stock is all subject to this\nconversion adjustment provision, and we are\nnow responsible for the indemnification\nobligations of our predecessors as well as\nourselves. We have also entered into a\nMastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing\nAgreement with Mastercard and other financial\ninstitution defendants and an Omnibus\nAgreement Regarding Interchange Litigation\nSharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa,\nMastercard and other financial institution\ndefendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in\nsubstance, apportions resolution of the claims\nin this litigation into a Visa portion and a\nMastercard portion, with the Visa portion\nbeing two-thirds and the Mastercard portion\nbeing one-third. This apportionment only\napplies in the case of either a global\nsettlement involving all defendants or an\nadverse judgment against the defendants, to\nthe extent that damages either are related to\nthe merchants\u2019 inter-network conspiracy claims\nor are otherwise not attributed to specific\nMastercard or Visa conduct or damages. The\nMastercard portion (or any Mastercard-related\nliability not subject to the Omnibus\nAgreement) will then be apportioned under the\nMastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing\nAgreement among Mastercard and PNC and the\nother financial institution defendants that\nare parties to this agreement. The\nresponsibility for the Visa portion (or any\nVisa-related liability not subject to the\nOmnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under\nthe pre-existing indemnification\nresponsibilities and judgment and loss sharing\nagreements.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn September 2020, a lawsuit ( United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 2:20-cv-319)) was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District\nof Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (\u201cthe first Texas case\u201d). The\nplaintiff amended its complaint in December\n2020. As amended, the complaint alleges that\nPNC\u2019s mobile remote deposit capture systems\ninfringe on four patents owned by the\nplaintiff. The plaintiff seeks, among other\nthings, a judgment that PNC is infringing\n\n176 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\neach of the patents, damages for willful\ninfringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In December\n2020, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint, and in January 2021, we filed a\nmotion to transfer the lawsuit to the United\nStates District Court for the Western District\nof Pennsylvania. In February 2021, we answered\nthe amended complaint and asserted\ncounterclaims alleging that the plaintiff\ninfringed four patents owned by PNC Bank, as\nwell as for a declaratory judgment that PNC\nBank does not infringe certain patents\nasserted by the plaintiff. In March 2021, the\nplaintiff filed a motion to dismiss two of the\npatent infringement counterclaims, as well as\nto sever the patent infringement counterclaims\nfor trial. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed\nan answer to PNC\u2019s counterclaims and asserted\na counterclaim in reply seeking a declaratory\njudgment that two of the asserted PNC patents\nare unenforceable due to inequitable conduct\nand unclean hands in prosecution of the\npatents. In September 2021, the court denied\nour motion to dismiss and our motion to\ntransfer the case. In November 2021, the court\ndenied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss two\nof the patent infringement counterclaims. Also\nin November 2021, the court issued a\nmemorandum opinion and order construing\ncertain claim terms of the patents in suit. In\nFebruary 2022, the magistrate judge granted\nthe plaintiff\u2019s motion to sever the patent\ninfringement counterclaims for trial. In March\n2022, the court overruled PNC\u2019s objections to\nand adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling on\nthe motion to sever.\n\nIn December 2020, we filed a lawsuit ( PNC\nBank, N.A. v. United Services Automobile\nAssociation (Case No. 2:20-cv-1886)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania against USAA seeking\ndeclaratory judgment of non-infringement as to\ntwo of the patents at issue in the first Texas\ncase and awarding PNC its fees and costs. In\nJanuary 2021, USAA filed a motion to dismiss\nor transfer PNC Bank\u2019s declaratory judgment\ncomplaint. In June 2021, the court stayed this\ncase pending a decision on the motion to\ntransfer filed by PNC Bank in the first Texas\ncase. The United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas denied PNC Bank\u2019s\nmotion to transfer in the first Texas case in\nSeptember 2021. This case presently remains\nstayed and administratively closed.\n\nIn March 2021, USAA filed a second lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-110)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement. The complaint alleges that PNC\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit capture systems infringe\ntwo patents owned by the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff seeks, among other things, a\njudgment that PNC is infringing each of the\npatents, damages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. In April 2021, we moved to\nconsolidate this action with the first Texas\ncase, and we filed motions to dismiss and\ntransfer this action. In July 2021, this\naction was consolidated with the first Texas\ncase (together, \u201cthe first consolidated\ncases\u201d). In September 2021, the court denied\nour motion to dismiss and our motion to\ntransfer for the same reasons set forth in its\nSeptember 2021 orders in the first Texas case.\nIn November 2021, the court issued a\nmemorandum opinion and order construing\ncertain claim terms of the patents in suit. In\nMay 2022, following a jury trial in the first\nconsolidated cases, a jury found against PNC\nfor willful infringement of at least one of\nthe plaintiff\u2019s asserted patent claims and\nawarded approximately $ 218million. In July\n2022, the parties submitted briefs on PNC\u2019s\nremaining equitable defenses. In August 2022,\nthe court denied our request for relief,\nentered final judgment, declined to award\nenhanced damages for willfulness, and awarded\nUSAA pre-judgment and applicable post-judgment\ninterest. In September 2022, PNC filed its\npost-trial motions for judgment as a matter of\nlaw and for a new trial.\n\nIn July 2021, USAA filed a third lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PN C\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-246)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (\u201cthe third Texas case\u201d). The\ncomplaint alleges that PNC\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems, including its new\nversions, infringe three additional patents\nowned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks,\namong other things, a judgment that PNC is\ninfringing each of the patents, damages for\nwillful infringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In\nJuly 2021, we filed motions to dismiss and\ntransfer this action; the court denied these\nmotions in January 2022. In March 2022, the\ncourt issued a memorandum opinion and order\nconstruing certain claim terms of the patents\nin suit. In June 2022, the court opened a new\ncase for PNC\u2019s patent infringement\ncounterclaims (originally asserted in the\nfirst Texas case) (\u201cthe fourth Texas case\u201d)\nand consolidated the fourth Texas case into\nthe third Texas case (together, \u201cthe second\nconsolidated cases\u201d). In September 2022,\nfollowing a jury trial in the second\nconsolidated cases, a jury found against PNC\nfor infringement of at least one of the two\nasserted patents and awarded $ 4.3million, and\ndetermined that PNC did not willfully infringe\nthe patents. The jury further found that USAA\ndid not infringe any of PNC\u2019s asserted\npatents. On January 23, 2023, USAA filed a\nmotion for a new trial regarding damages in\nthe second consolidated cases.\n\nIn August 2021, USAA filed a lawsuit ( United\nServices Automobile Association v. BBVA USA\n(Case No. 2:21-cv-311)) in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas against BBVA USA for patent infringement\n(\u201cthe BBVA USA Texas case\u201d). The complaint\nalleges that BBVA USA\u2019s remote deposit capture\nsystems infringe the same six USAA patents at\nissue in the first consolidated cases. The\nplaintiff seeks, among other things, a\njudgment that BBVA USA is infringing each of\nthe patents, damages for willful infringement,\nand attorneys\u2019 fees. In October 2021, BBVA USA\nwas merged into PNC Bank. Also in October\n2021, we answered the complaint and asserted\ncounterclaims for a declaratory judgment that\nthe asserted patents are invalid and not\ninfringed. In March 2022, the court entered\nthe parties\u2019 stipulation to, among other\nthings, proceed under the constructions set\nforth in the first consolidated cases. In June\n2022, the court entered a stipulation proposed\nby the parties, stayed all deadlines, and\nadministratively closed the matter.\n\nIn January 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard granted institution of inter partes\nreview (\u201cIPR\u201d) with respect to petitions filed\nby PNC for three of the six patents then at\nissue in the first consolidated cases and in\nthe BBVA USA Texas case. The Patent Trial and\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2022\n                                 Form 10-K 177\nAppeal Board denied institution of an IPR with\nrespect to PNC\u2019s petitions for three of the\nsix patents then at issue in the first\nconsolidated cases and in the BBVA USA Texas\ncase. Oral argument for the IPR proceedings at\nthe Patent Trial and Appeal Board occurred on\nOctober 25 and 26, 2022. Because of USAA\u2019s\ncase narrowing in the first consolidated\ncases, only one of these three patents being\nreviewed was presented to the jury in the\nfirst consolidated cases. On January 19, 2023,\nwith respect to two of the three patents in\nwhich an IPR was instituted, the Patent Trial\nand Appeal Board entered its Final Written\nDecision. It found each of the challenged\nclaims in these two patents to be\nunpatentable. One of these patents was\npresented to the jury in the first\nconsolidated cases. On January 20, 2023, with\nrespect to the third patent in which an IPR\nwas instituted, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard entered its Final Written Decision. It\nfound that all the challenged claims in this\nthird patent were unpatentable. On January 27,\n2023, based on the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard\u2019s finding that the asserted claims of\none of the patents presented to the jury in\nthe first consolidated cases were\nunpatentable, PNC filed a motion seeking leave\nto file a supplemental brief in support of a\nmotion for a new trial as well as its brief in\nsupport for a new trial in the first\nconsolidated cases. On February 1, 2023, the\ncourt granted PNC\u2019s motion for leave to file a\nsupplemental brief in support for a new trial\nand accepted PNC\u2019s brief for a new trial.\n\nIn May and June 2022, the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board granted institution of IPR with\nrespect to petitions filed by PNC for two of\nthe three patents then at issue in the third\nTexas case. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board\ndenied institution of an IPR with respect to\nPNC\u2019s petitions for one of the three patents\nthen at issue in the third Texas case. Oral\nargument for the first of the two IPR\nproceedings at the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard occurred on February 9 and oral argument\nfor the second is presently scheduled for\nMarch 13, 2023. Because of USAA\u2019s case\nnarrowing in the third Texas case, only one of\nthese two patents being reviewed was presented\nto the jury in the third Texas case.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad range of\nissues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage,\nsecurities and other financial services\nbusinesses, as well as other aspects of our\noperations. In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of reviews of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries have involved\nand may in the future involve or lead to\nregulatory enforcement actions and other\nadministrative proceedings. These inquiries\nhave also led to and may in the future lead to\ncivil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some\nof these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described above, PNC and persons to\nwhom we may have indemnification obligations,\nin the normal course of business, are subject\nto various other pending and threatened legal\nproceedings in which claims for monetary\ndamages and other relief are asserted. We do\nnot anticipate, at the present time, that the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of such other legal proceedings will have\na material adverse effect on our financial\nposition. However, we cannot now determine\nwhether or not any claims asserted against us\nor others to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, whether in the proceedings or\nother matters described above or otherwise,\nwill have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations in any future reporting\nperiod, which will depend on, among other\nthings, the amount of the loss resulting from\nthe claim and the amount of income otherwise\nreported for the reporting period.\n\n178 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n

threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock,\nwhich had previously been reported as a\nseparate business segment. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity for\nadditional information on the sale and details\non our results and cash flow for 2020.\n\nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income.\nThese differences are reflected in the \u201cOther\u201d\ncategory in Table 120. \u201cOther\u201d includes\nresidual activities that do not meet the\ncriteria for disclosure as a separate\nreportable business, such as asset and\nliability management activities, including net\nsecurities gains or losses, ACL for investment\nsecurities, certain trading activities,\ncertain runoff consumer loan portfolios,\nprivate equity investments, intercompany\neliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax\nadjustments that are not allocated to business\nsegments, exited businesses and differences\nbetween business segment performance reporting\nand financial statement reporting (GAAP).\nAssets, revenue and earnings attributable to\nforeign activities were not material in the\nperiods presented for comparison.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstandalone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology.

The objective of the\nstandard is to clarify the principles for\nrecognizing revenue from contracts with\ncustomers across all industries and to develop\na common revenue standard under GAAP. The\nstandard requires the application of a five-\nstep recognition model to contracts,\nallocating the amount of consideration we\nexpect to be entitled to across distinct\npromises in the contract, called performance\nobligations, and recognizing revenue when or\nas those services are transferred to the\ncustomer.\n\nFee-based revenue within the scope of Topic\n606 is recognized within our threereportable\nbusiness segments: Retail Banking, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking and Asset Management\nGroup.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP.

reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\n198 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2022 Form 10-K\n\nWe performed an evaluation under the\nsupervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including the Chairman, President\nand Chief Executive Officer and the Executive\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer, of\nthe effectiveness of PNC\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022.
