(BBVA), a U.S. financial\nholding company conducting its business\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA. PNC paid $11.5 billion\nin cash as consideration for the acquisition.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC\nBank. On October 12, 2021, PNC converted\napproximately 2.6 million customers, 9,000\nemployees and over 600 branches across seven\nstates. Our results of operations and balance\nsheets for all periods presented in this\nReport reflect the benefit of BBVA's acquired\nbusinesses for the period since the\nacquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\n\nFor additional information on the acquisition\nof BBVA, see Note 2 Acquisition Activity in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Report and Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Income Statement Highlights                 \n                                              \nNet income of $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per\ndiluted common share for the second quarter of\n2022 increased $67 million, or 5%, compared to\n$1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common\nshare for the first quarter of 2022, driven by\nhigher net interest and noninterest income,\npartially offset by a higher provision for\ncredit losses and higher expenses.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended June 30, 2022\ncompared to the three months ended March 31,\n2022:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $424 million, or 9%,\nto $5.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income of $3.1 billion\nincreased $247 million, or 9%, driven by\nhigher yields on interest-earning assets and\nincreased loan balances, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 22 basis\npoints to 2.50% due to higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $177 million,\nor 9%, to $2.1 billion, primarily due to\nincreases in capital markets related fees.\n\n\u2022 The second quarter of 2022 included a\nprovision for credit losses of $36 million.\nThe first quarter of 2022 included a provision\nrecapture of $208 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $72 million,\nor 2%, to $3.2 billion, driven by increased\nbusiness activity, annual employee merit\nincreases and higher marketing spend.\n\n\u2022 We generated positive operating leverage of\n7% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to\nthe first quarter of 2022.\n\nNet income of $2.9 billion, or $6.61 per\ndiluted common share for the first six months\nof 2022 decreased $4 million, compared to $2.9\nbillion, or $6.53 per diluted common share for\nthe six months ended 2021, as higher net\ninterest income was largely offset by higher\nexpenses and a lower provision recapture.\n\n\u2022 For the six months ended June 30, 2022\ncompared to the six months ended June 30,\n2021:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $921 million, or\n10%, to $9.8 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income increased $926 million,\nor 19%, as a result of higher interest-earning\nasset balances, reflecting the benefit of\nBBVA, and higher yields, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 11 basis\npoints, due to higher yields on interest-\nearning assets.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $5 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $792 million,\nor 14%, driven by the addition of BBVA\noperating expenses and increased business\nactivity, partially offset by lower\nintegration expenses.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nIncome Statement Review section of this\nFinancial Review.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 3\n                                              \n  Balance Sheet Highlights                    \n                                              \nOur balance sheet was well positioned at June\n30, 2022.

The decrease\nwas primarily driven by the impacts from\nportfolio changes and improved COVID-19\nrelated economic conditions.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs of $83 million, or 0.11% of\naverage loans in the second quarter of 2022\ndecreased $54 million, or 39%, compared to\n$137 million, or 0.19% of average loans, for\nthe first quarter of 2022, driven by lower\nconsumer net charge-offs, primarily within\nauto.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Capital Highlights                          \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital position.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity of $41.6 billion\nat June 30, 2022, decreased $9.1 billion, or\n18%, compared to December 31, 2021 as net\nincome was more than offset by a decrease in\nAOCI, reflecting the impact of higher interest\nrates on net unrealized losses on securities\nand swaps. The decline was also attributable\nto common share repurchases and dividends\npaid.\n\n\u2022 In the second quarter, we returned $1.4\nbillion of capital to shareholders through\ncommon share repurchases of $737 million,\nrepresenting 4.3 million shares, and dividends\non common shares of $627 million.\n\n\u2022 The SCB framework allows for capital returns\nin amounts up to the level of capital in\nexcess of the firm's SCB plus the regulatory\nminimum level of capital (e.g., CET1 of 4.5%).\nConsistent with the flexibility provided under\nthe SCB framework, our Board of Directors has\nrecently authorized a new share repurchase\nstructure, under the already approved\nauthorization for repurchases of up to 100\nmillion common shares, of which approximately\n59% were still available at June 30, 2022.\nThis framework and our capital flexibility\nallow for the continuation of our recent\nquarterly average share repurchase levels in\ndollars as well as the ability to increase\nthose levels should conditions warrant. PNC's\nSCB for the four-quarter period beginning\nOctober 1, 2022 is 2.9%.\n\n\u2022 On July 1, 2022, the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.50 per share payable on August 5,\n2022.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio decreased to 9.6% at June 30,\n2022 from 10.3% at December 31, 2021.\n\n\u2022 Capital was impacted by our election to\ndelay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1\ncapital through December 31, 2021, followed by\na three-year transition period.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to be lower\nthan the economy\u2019s long-run average throughout\nthis year. Consumer spending growth will\nremain solid in 2022 due to good underlying\nfundamentals.\n\n\u2022 Supply-chain difficulties will gradually\nease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages\nwill remain a constraint this year, although\nstrong wage growth will support consumer\nspending.\n\n\u2022 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades. Inflation\nwill slow in the second half of 2022 as\npandemic-related supply and demand imbalances\nrecede and energy prices stabilize. However,\ninflation will also broaden throughout the\neconomy due to wage growth. The annual\ninflation rate will end 2022 above the Federal\nReserve\u2019s long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2022 The FOMC raised the federal funds rate by\n0.75% in July, to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%.\nPNC expects further increases in the federal\nfunds rate through the rest of this year, to a\nrange of 3.25% to 3.50% at the end of 2022.\nThe federal funds rate is expected to peak\nbetween 3.50% and 3.75% in mid-early 2023,\nbefore falling in the second half of next year\nas inflation ebbs and economic growth slows.\n\n\u2022 Uncertainty about the outlook has increased\nwith the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has\ncreated additional risk to higher inflation\nthis year, which could lead the FOMC to\ntighten more aggressively than currently\nanticipated. In addition, risks to growth and\nthe likelihood of a recession in late 2022 or\n2023 have increased.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2022, compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2022, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up 10% to 12%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income, excluding net securities\ngains and Visa activity, to be down 3% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up 4% to 6%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%,\nand\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $125\nmillion and $175 million.\n\nFor the full year 2022, compared to full year\n2021, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up approximately 13%,\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be up approximately 8%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up 9% to 11%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense, excluding integration\nexpense, to be up 4% to 6%, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n19%.\n\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nFinancial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in\nour 2021 Form 10-K for other factors that\ncould cause future events to differ, perhaps\nmaterially, from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements.\n                                              \n   C                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ONSOLIDATED                                \n                                              \n                                              \n   I                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   NCOME                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   S                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   TATEMENT                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n   R                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   EVIEW                                      \n                                              \nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\n\nNet income of $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per\ndiluted common share for the second quarter of\n2022 increased $67 million, or 5%, compared to\n$1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common\nshare for the first quarter of 2022, driven by\nhigher net interest and noninterest income,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 5\npartially offset by a higher provision for\ncredit losses and higher expenses.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income increased $247 million, or\n9%, for the second quarter of 2022 compared to\nthe first quarter of 2022, driven by higher\nyields on interest-earning assets and\nincreased loan balances, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs. Net interest income\nincreased $926 million, or 19%, for the first\nsix months of 2022 compared to the same period\nin 2021, as a result of higher interest-\nearning asset balances, reflecting the benefit\nof BBVA, and higher yields, partially offset\nby higher funding costs.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nNet interest margin in the quarterly and year-\nto-date comparisons increased 22 basis points\nand 11 basis points, respectively. In both\ncomparisons, the increase was primarily due to\nhigher yields on interest-earning assets.\n\nAverage investment securities for the second\nquarter of 2022 increased $827 million, or 1%\ncompared to the first quarter of 2022\nreflecting net purchases, primarily of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities.\nAverage investment securities increased $36.8\nmillion, or 38% in the year-to-date\ncomparison, due to net securities purchases,\nprimarily of U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities purchases and the addition\nof BBVA. Average investment securities\nrepresented 28% of average interest-earning\nassets for the second quarter of 2022 compared\nto 27% for the first quarter of 2022, and 27%\nfor the first six months of 2022 compared to\n22% for the first six months of 2021.\n\nIn the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\naverage loans increased $14.1 billion, or 5%,\nand $50.9 billion, or 21%, respectively. In\nboth comparisons, the increase was due to\ngrowth in commercial and consumer loans,\npartially offset by PPP loan forgiveness. The\nincrease in the year-to-date comparison also\nreflects the impact of the BBVA acquisition.\nAverage loans represented 62% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the second quarter\nof 2022 compared to 59% for the first quarter\nof 2022, and 60% for the first six months of\n2022 compared to 57% for the first six months\nof 2021.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the second quarter of 2022 decreased $22.9\nbillion, or 37%, compared to the first quarter\nof 2022, primarily due to higher loans\noutstanding and lower deposits. In the year-\nto-date comparison, average interest-earning\ndeposits with banks decreased $30.8 billion,\nor 38%, reflecting higher loan and securities\nbalances, partially offset by higher deposits.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nsecond quarter of 2022 decreased $2.4 billion,\nor 1%, compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nThe decrease was driven by lower commercial\ndeposits reflecting deposit outflows and\nseasonal declines. Average interest-bearing\ndeposits increased $37.5 billion, or 14% in\nthe year-to-date comparison, primarily\nattributable to the BBVA acquisition. In\ntotal, average interest-bearing deposits\nrepresented 89% of average interest-bearing\nliabilities for the second quarter of 2022\ncompared to 91% for the first quarter of 2022,\nand 90% for the first six months of 2022\ncompared to 88% for the first six months of\n2021.\n\nAverage borrowed funds for the second quarter\nof 2022 increased $5.3 billion, or 18%,\ncompared to the first quarter of 2022 due to\nincreased FHLB borrowings. Average borrowed\nfunds for the first six months of 2022\ndecreased $1.7 billion, or 5%, compared to the\nfirst six months of 2021, reflecting lower\nbank notes and senior debt, partially offset\nby higher FHLB borrowings.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 3: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 40% for the second and first\nquarters of 2022, and 40% for the first six\nmonths of 2022 compared to 45% for the same\nperiod in 2021.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees decreased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2022,\nprimarily as a result of lower average equity\nmarkets. The increase in the year-to-date\ncomparison was due to higher average equity\nmarkets and the benefit of BBVA.

The\nincrease compared to the first six months of\n2021 also reflected the addition of BBVA\ncustomers.\n\nLending and deposit services increased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2022 and\nincluded lower integration related fee\nwaivers. The increase in the year-to-date\ncomparison was due to the benefit of BBVA,\npartially offset by the impact of Low Cash\nMode \u00ae on overdraft fees and integration\nrelated fee waivers.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage increased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2022 as\nhigher revenue from commercial mortgage\nbanking activities was largely offset by lower\nresidential mortgage loan sales revenue. The\ndecrease in the year-to-date comparison was\ndue to lower residential and commercial\nmortgage banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased compared to\nthe first quarter of 2022, and included $16\nmillion of negative Visa Class B derivative\nfair value adjustments related to litigation\nescrow funding and other valuation changes.\nThe first quarter of 2022 included $4 million\nof positive Visa Class B fair value\nadjustments. The decrease in the year-to-date\ncomparison included the impact of lower\nprivate equity revenue.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Expense                \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest expense increased compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2022, driven by increased\nbusiness activity, annual employee merit\nincreases and higher marketing spend.

June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n\u2022 Total assets decreased primarily due to\nlower balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank, partially offset by higher loans.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities decreased driven by lower\ncommercial and consumer deposits, partially\noffset by higher borrowed funds.\n\n\u2022 Total equity decreased as net income and the\nissuance of preferred stock

The relationship of fair value to\namortized cost at June 30, 2022 compared to\nDecember 31, 2021 primarily reflected the\nimpact of higher interest rates on the\nvaluation of fixed rate securities. We have\nincluded credit ratings information because we\nbelieve that the information is an indicator\nof the degree of credit risk to which we are\nexposed. Changes in credit ratings\nclassifications could indicate increased or\ndecreased credit risk and could be accompanied\nby a reduction or increase in the fair value\nof our investment securities portfolio. We\ncontinually monitor the credit risk in our\nportfolio and maintain the allowance for\ninvestment securities at an appropriate level\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\ninvestment securities portfolio for the\nremaining contractual term of the securities\nadjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 3\nInvestment Securities in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Report for additional details\nregarding the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nIn the first and second quarters of 2022, we\ntransferred securities with a fair value of\n$18.7 billion and $59.1 billion, respectively,\nfrom available for sale to held to maturity.\nWe changed our intent and committed to hold\nthese high-quality securities to maturity in\norder to reduce the impact of price volatility\non AOCI and tangible capital. See Note 3\nInvestment Securities in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Report for additional details\nregarding this transfer.\n\nOn July 28, 2022, we transferred an additional\n$5.0 billion of available for sale securities\nto held to maturity.

to\nincreased noninterest expense, partially\noffset by higher net interest and noninterest\nincome.\n\nNet interest income increased primarily due to\ngrowth in average deposit and loan balances,\nreflecting the BBVA acquisition, along with\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\nloans, partially offset by narrower interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits.\n\nNoninterest income increased due to higher\ncard and cash management revenue, increased\nasset management and brokerage fees and higher\nlending and deposit related fees. All of these\ncategories benefited from the addition of BBVA\ncustomers and increased business activity.\n\nNoninterest expense increased primarily due to\nthe impact of BBVA operating expenses,\nincreased business activity and continued\ninvestments in strategic initiatives.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC.

Average consumer\nloans increased 23% due to the impact of the\nBBVA acquisition on all loan classes except\neducation loans, which BBVA did not have in\ntheir loan portfolio. In addition, average\nresidential real estate loans increased due to\ncontinued strength in portfolio originations.\nAverage commercial loans decreased primarily\ndue to forgiveness of PPP loans.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe have established a coast-to-coast network\nof retail branches and ATMs that operate\nalongside PNC\u2019s suite of digital capabilities.\nOver time, we plan to continue to convert a\nportion of these branches to solution centers,\nwhich have a distinctive layout and the\ncapability to support transactions, sales and\nadvice using a combination of technology and\npersonalized banker assistance. PNC began to\ndeploy solution centers in 2018.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking, payments and investment\nproducts. In 2021, we successfully rolled out\nLow Cash Mode \u00ae to all Virtual Wallet \u00ae\ncustomers providing them with the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent\nor address overdrafts and controls to choose\nwhether to return certain debits rather than\nthe bank making the decision.\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result, have closed 96 branches in\nthe first six months of 2022, consistent with\nour plan.\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased primarily\ndriven by loans from BBVA, higher utilization\nof loan commitments and new production.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting loans from\nBBVA, partially offset by lower commercial\nmortgage lending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by PPP\nloan forgiveness, partially offset by loans\nfrom BBVA.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased in the\ncomparison reflecting deposits from BBVA. We\ncontinue to actively monitor the interest rate\nenvironment and make adjustments to evolving\nmarket conditions, bank funding needs and\nclient relationship dynamics.\n\nIn 2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s geographic\nexpansion. Following the BBVA acquisition and\nour de novo expansion efforts, we are now a\ncoast-to-coast franchise and have a presence\nin the largest 30 U.S. metropolitan\nstatistical areas. These expanded locations\ncomplement Corporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s\nnational businesses with a significant\npresence in these cities and our full suite of\ncommercial products and services is now\noffered nationally.\n                                              \n  Product Revenue                             \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital markets\nrelated products and services and commercial\nmortgage banking activities, for customers of\nall business segments. On a consolidated\nbasis, the revenue from these other services\nis included in net interest income and\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses. The Other\nInformation section in Table 12 includes the\nconsolidated revenue to PNC for treasury\nmanagement and commercial mortgage banking\nservices. A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nWithin Treasury Management, PNC Global\nTransfers provides wholesale money transfer\nprocessing capabilities between the U.S. and\nMexico and other countries primarily in\nCentral and South America. Treasury management\nrevenue is reported in noninterest income and\nnet interest income. Noninterest income\nincludes treasury management product revenue\nless earnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nNet interest income primarily includes revenue\nfrom all treasury management customer deposit\nbalances. Compared with the first six months\nof 2021, treasury management revenue increased\ndue to higher noninterest income and higher\ndeposit balances, including the impact of the\nBBVA acquisition and wider interest rate\nspreads on the value of deposits.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower revenue from commercial\nmortgage loans held for sale and lower\ncommercial mortgage servicing income.\n\nCapital markets related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The noninterest income\ngenerated from these revenue streams is\nreflected in the capital markets related\ncategory on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nCompared with the first six months of 2021,\ncapital markets related noninterest income\nincreased due to higher merger and acquisition\nfees, higher fees on customer-related\nderivatives activities and higher loan\nsyndication fees. These increases were\npartially offset by lower equity capital\nmarkets advisory fees, lower underwriting fees\nand lower credit valuation on customer-related\nderivatives activities.\n The PNC

Examples of this collateral\ninclude short-term assets, such as accounts\nreceivable, inventory and securities, and\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-\noccupied real estate and other business\nassets.\n\nWe actively manage our commercial and\nindustrial loans to assess any changes (both\npositive and negative) in the level of credit\nrisk at both the borrower and portfolio level.\nTo evaluate the level of credit risk, we\nassign internal risk ratings reflecting our\nestimates of the borrower\u2019s PD and LGD for\neach related credit facility. This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geographies that may exist in our\nportfolio.

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $38.4 billion at June 30, 2022\nwith 44% located in California. Comparable\namounts at December 31, 2021 were $34.9\nbillion and 42%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $17.6 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $7.1 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at June 30, 2022.\nComparable amounts were $15.8 billion and $8.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance of this\nportfolio monthly similarly to residential\nreal estate loans. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit, brokered\nhome equity lines of credit) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold the lien.\nThis information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ju\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5,\u2026    21    %    $  5\u2026     21   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    13            3\u2026     13      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026    10            2\u2026     10      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     8            1\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       999     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       941     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       881     4            7\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       5,\u2026    21            5\u2026     23      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  24\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              62    %              62   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              38                   38      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       Ju\u2026                  D\u2026             \n  \u2026       30,                  3\u2026             \n  \u2026       20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  777                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              67    %              66   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at June 30, 2022.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $14.2 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.1 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of June 30, 2022.\nComparable amounts as of December 31, 2021\nwere $15.4 billion and $1.2 billion,\nrespectively.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower, repayment sources,\nunderlying collateral, and other support given\ncurrent events, economic conditions and\nexpectations. We refine our practices to meet\nthe changing environment resulting from rising\ninflation levels, supply chain disruptions,\nhigher rates, and secular changes fostered by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance. As a result,\nunder the CARES Act credit reporting rules,\ncertain loans modified due to COVID-19 related\nhardships are not being reported as past due\nas of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\naccruing loans past due by delinquency status:\n                                              \n  Table 22: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)       \n                                              \n                                              \n                                  %           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion\nand $0.5 billion at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe decline in accruing loans past due from\nDecember 31, 2021 was due to reductions in\nboth consumer and commercial delinquencies,\ndriven by the resolution of BBVA conversion-\nrelated administrative and operational delays.\n\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\ncontinue to accrue interest because they are\n(i) well secured by collateral and are in the\nprocess of collection, (ii) managed in\nhomogeneous portfolios with specified charge-\noff timeframes adhering to regulatory\nguidelines, or (iii) certain government\ninsured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that met certain\ncriteria under the CARES Act were not\ncategorized as TDRs during the relief period,\nwhich expired on January 1, 2022.

by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as of\nJune 30, 2022, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the minimum requirement of 100%.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank are\nrequired to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing\nbasis, and as of June 30, 2022, the NSFR for\nPNC and PNC Bank exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of 100%.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding.

See the Funding\nSources portion of the Consolidated Balance\nSheet Review section of this Financial Review\nfor additional information related to our\ndeposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, our liquid assets consisted\nof cash and due from banks and short-term\ninvestments (federal funds sold, resale\nagreements, trading securities and interest-\nearning deposits with banks) totaling $40.8\nbillion and securities available for sale\ntotaling $53.0 billion. The level of liquid\nassets fluctuates over time based on many\nfactors, including market conditions, loan and\ndeposit growth and balance sheet management\nactivities.

The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nJune 30, 2022, our unused secured borrowing\ncapacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the\nFederal Reserve Bank totaled $79.5 billion.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 31\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At June 30, 2022, there\nwere no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing its\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $8.2 billion. Parent company\nliquidity is held in intercompany cash and\ninvestments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $2.1 billion at June 30, 2022.\nSee Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of these limitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Authorized by the Board of\nDirectors, the parent company has the ability\nto offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial\npaper to provide additional liquidity.

The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC\u2019s\nelection to adopt the CECL five-year\ntransition provisions. Effective for the first\nquarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the\nfull impact of CECL and excludes the benefits\nof the optional five-year transition.\n\n(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have\nelected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\n\n(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-\nweighted assets are based on the Basel III\nstandardized approach rules and include credit\nand market risk-weighted assets.\n\n(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account the quarterly average of both on\nbalance sheet assets as well as certain off-\nbalance sheet items, including loan\ncommitments and potential future exposure\nunder derivative contracts.\n\n(f) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date, excluding the initial\nallowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to\nCECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first\nquarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period, and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024. See\nadditional discussion of this rule in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2021\nForm 10-K.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, PNC and PNC Bank were\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on\napplicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d, PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and\na Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient\n\n34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nto withstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our June 30, 2022\ncapital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management                      \n                                              \nSee the Market Risk Management portion of the\nRisk Management Section in our 2021 Form 10-K\nfor additional discussion regarding market\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans. Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our risk management policies,\nwhich are approved by management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the second quarters of 2022 and\n2021 follow:\n                                              \n  Table 31: Interest Sensitivity Analysis     \n                                              \n                                              \n                   Second           Second    \n                   Quarter          Quarter   \n                   2022             2021      \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       3.2  %           5.2  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point      -3.4  %                N/A       \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       5.6  %          13.1  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point      -6.4  %                N/A       \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n                                              \n(a) Due to the prevailing low interest rate\nenvironment post pandemic, the reporting of\nNet interest income sensitivities for the 100\nbasis point decrease scenario was suspended\nfrom the first quarter of 2020 to the first\nquarter of 2022.\n\nIn addition to measuring the effect on net\ninterest income assuming parallel changes in\ncurrent interest rates, we routinely simulate\nthe effects of a number of nonparallel\ninterest rate environments.

Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the June 30, 2022 per\nshare closing price of $196.89 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.1 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2021 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements.

See\nthe Liquidity and Capital Management portion\nof the Risk Management section in this\nFinancial Review for a discussion of PNC\u2019s\ncapital actions.\n\nOther Developments\n\nIn May 2022, the federal banking agencies\nissued a notice of proposed rulemaking to\namend the regulations implementing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA), which\nrequires the agencies to assess a bank\u2019s\nrecord of meeting the credit needs of the\ncommunities in which they do business,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. The proposal would\nsignificantly expand the number of areas in\nwhich a bank is evaluated, materially change\nthe tests used to evaluate the bank in those\nareas, and expand the data a bank must collect\nand report. T he proposal, if finalized, could\nincrease PNC Bank\u2019s obligations and compliance\ncosts necessary to achieve a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d rating under the CRA framework,\nwhich factor into the ability of banks to\nexpand and engage in new activities.\n\nIn June 2022, the FDIC issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking to increase the assessment\nrates on deposit insurance by two basis points\nfor all insured depository institutions like\nPNC Bank. Under the proposal, the new\nassessment rate schedule would begin with the\nfirst assessment period of 2023 and continue\nuntil the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches a\nreserve ratio of two percent.\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2021 Form\n10-K describes the most significant accounting\npolicies that we use to prepare our\nconsolidated financial statements. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7\nof our 2021 Form 10-K. The following details\nthe critical estimates and judgments around\nthe ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments. Our\ndetermination of the ACL is based on\nhistorical loss and performance experience, as\nwell as current borrower and transaction\ncharacteristics including collateral type and\nquality, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply\nqualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our\nbest estimate of amounts that we do not expect\nto collect because of, among other things,\nidiosyncratic risk factors, changes in\neconomic conditions that may not be reflected\nin forecasted results, or other potential\nmethodology limitations. The major drivers of\nACL estimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC, and the committee also determines\nand approves CECL scenarios' weights for use\nfor the current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended June\n30, 2022 reflect an increase in downside risk\ncompared to December 31, 2021. The current\noutlook considers the inflationary pressures\nthat have broadened and intensified in recent\nmonths, along with our expectation that the\nFOMC will raise interest rates more\naggressively than what was expected at\nDecember 31, 2021, increasing the risk of a\nbroader-ranged economic slowdown. Though the\nmost-likely expectation continues to be that\nthe U.S. economy avoids recession, growth is\nexpected to slow noticeably from current\nlevels, and the primary downside risk to the\noutlook has shifted from the pandemic to\nmonetary policy tightening and inflation.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with the most significant drivers\nbeing Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate.\nThe following table presents a comparison of\nthese two economic variables based on the\nweighted-average scenario forecasts used in\ndetermining our ACL at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nTable 35: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                  as of June                  \n                    30, 2022                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. Real             1.6%    0.5%    1.2%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            3.6%    4.5%    4.5%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2021                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n  U.S. Real             2.8%    1.4%    1.3%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.4%    4.1%    3.9%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2022 at\n1.6% on a weighted average basis, down from\nthe 2.8% assumed at December 31, 2021 due\nprimarily to weaker expected growth in the\nsecond half of 2022, along with the unexpected\ncontraction of GDP in the first quarter of\n2022. Growth continues to slow to 0.5% and\n1.2% in 2023 and 2024. In line with the\nslowing in overall economic activity, the\nweighted average unemployment rate is expected\nto increase modestly to 4.5% in 2023,\nremaining at that level through 2024.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 39\nThe economy has seen significant improvement\nfrom the onset of the pandemic, as containment\nof the virus has permitted recovery in many\nindustries. However, the pandemic fostered\nstructural/secular changes that persist in\ncertain subsegments of the economy.\nAdditionally, recent challenges related to\ninflation, increased pressure on supply chain\nand rising interest rates have emerged. The\ncurrent state of the economy has created\nconsiderable uncertainty around losses for\ncertain portions of our commercial and\nconsumer portfolios. For commercial borrowers,\nsupply chain, inflation, rising rates and\nadvancing secular changes are the primary\ndrivers of uncertainty. For consumer\nborrowers, higher inflation risk, rising\ninterest rates and the fading effects of\ngovernment stimulus could reduce consumer\nliquidity and change payment hierarchy. As\nsuch, for both our commercial and consumer\nloan portfolios, PNC identified and performed\nsignificant analysis around these segments to\nensure our reserves are adequate in the\ncurrent economic environment.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nappropriately reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nSee the following for additional details on\nthe components of our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance For Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Financial\nReview, and\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Report.\n                                              \n  Recently Issued Accounting Standards        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022Required                    \n                 effective                    \n                 date of                      \n                 January 1,                   \n                 2023; early                  \n                 adoption is                  \n                 permitted.                   \n                 \u2022Eliminates                  \n                 the                          \n                 accounting                   \n                 guidance                     \n                 for TDRs                     \n                 and                          \n                 requires an                  \n                 entity to                    \n                 apply the                    \n                 loan                         \n                 refinancing                  \n                 and                          \n                 restructur\u2026                  \n                 guidance to                  \n                 determine                    \n                 whether a                    \n                 modificati\u2026                  \n                 results in                   \n                 a new loan                   \n                 or a                         \n                 continuati\u2026                  \n                 of an                        \n                 existing                     \n                 loan.                        \n                 \u2022Enhances      \u2022We do not    \n                 disclosure     expect the    \n                 requiremen\u2026    adoption of   \n                 for certain    this          \n                 loan           standard to   \n                 refinancin\u2026    materially    \n                 and            impact our    \n                 restructur\u2026    consolidated  \n                 by             results of    \n                 creditors      operations    \n  Troubled       when a         or our        \n  Debt           borrower is    consolidated  \n  Restructur\u2026    experienci\u2026    financial     \n  and Vintage    financial      position.     \n  Disclosures    difficulty.

Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance.

These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to be lower\nthan the economy\u2019s long-run average throughout\nthis year. Consumer spending growth will\nremain solid in 2022 due to good underlying\nfundamentals.\n\n\u2013 Supply-chain difficulties will gradually\nease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages\nwill remain a constraint this year, although\nstrong wage growth will support consumer\nspending.\n\n\u2013 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades. Inflation\nwill slow in the second half of 2022 as\npandemic-related supply and demand imbalances\nrecede and energy prices stabilize. However,\ninflation will also broaden throughout the\neconomy due to wage growth. The annual\ninflation rate will end 2022 above the Federal\nReserve's long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2013 The FOMC raised the federal funds rate by\n0.75% in July, to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%.\nPNC expects further increases in the federal\nfunds rate through the rest of this year, to a\nrange of 3.25% to 3.50% at the end of 2022.\nThe federal funds rate is expected to peak\nbetween 3.50% and 3.75% in mid-early 2023,\nbefore falling in the second half of next year\nas inflation ebbs and economic growth slows.\n\n\u2013 Uncertainty about the outlook has increased\nwith the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has\ncreated additional risk to higher inflation\nthis year, which could lead the FOMC to\ntighten more aggressively than currently\nanticipated. In addition, risks to growth and\nthe likelihood of a recession in late 2022 or\n2023 have increased.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board's CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities.

These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, and the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nMany of these risks and uncertainties are\npresent in our acquisition and integration of\nBBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary,\nBBVA USA.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures, security\nbreaches, cyberattacks or international\nhostilities through impacts on the economy and\nfinancial markets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2021 Form 10-K,\nfirst quarter 2022 Form 10-Q and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to\npresent fairly our results for the interim\nperiods. The results of operations for interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the full year\nor any other interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2021 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2021 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2021 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements. There have been no significant\nchanges to our accounting policies as\ndisclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K.\nNoninterest Income Presentation\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nupdated the presentation of its noninterest\nincome categorization to be based on product\nand service type, and accordingly, has changed\nthe basis of presentation of its noninterest\nincome revenue streams to: (i) Asset\nmanagement and brokerage, (ii) Capital markets\nrelated, (iii) Card and cash management, (iv)\nLending and deposit services, (v) Residential\nand commercial mortgage and (vi) Other\nnoninterest income.

Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements, including for the\nBBVA acquisition. Actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates and the differences may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022 Provides                   \n                 optional                     \n                 expedients                   \n                 and                          \n                 exceptions                   \n                 for                          \n                 applying                     \n                 generally                    \n                 accepted                     \n                 accounting                   \n                 principles                   \n                 to                           \n                 contracts,                   \n                 hedging                      \n                 relationsh\u2026                  \n                 and other                    \n                 transactio\u2026                  \n                 that                         \n                 reference                    \n                 LIBOR or                     \n                 another                      \n                 reference                    \n                 rate                         \n                 expected to                  \n                 be                           \n                 discontinu\u2026                  \n                 because of                   \n                 reference                    \n                 rate reform                  \n                 (codified                    \n                 in ASC                       \n                 848).                        \n                 \u2022 Includes                   \n                 optional                     \n                 expedients                   \n                 related to                   \n                 contract                     \n                 modificati\u2026                  \n                 that allow                   \n                 an entity                    \n                 to account                   \n                 for                          \n                 modificati\u2026                  \n                 (if certain                  \n                 criteria                     \n                 are met) as                  \n                 if the                       \n                 modificati\u2026    \u2022 ASU         \n                 were only      2020-04 was   \n                 minor          adopted       \n                 (assets        March 12,     \n                 within the     2020.

PNC did not acquire the\nfollowing entities as part of the acquisition:\nBBVA Securities, Inc., Propel Venture Partners\nFund I, L.P. and BBVA Processing Services,\nInc. This transaction has been accounted for\nas a business combination. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA were recorded\nat fair value as of the acquisition date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA are subject\nto adjustment for up to one year after the\nclosing date of the acquisition as additional\ninformation becomes available.

The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 5.4billion, at June 30, 2022,\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at June 30, 2022\nincluded $ 0.4billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for June 30, 2021 was $\n0.3billion.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we transferred\nsecurities with a fair value of $ 18.7billion\nfrom available for sale to held to maturity.\nThe securities transferred included $\n9.2billion of U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities and $ 9.5billion of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities. During\nthe second quarter of 2022, we transferred\nsecurities with a fair value of $ 59.1billion\nfrom available for sale to held to maturity.\nThe securities transferred included $\n21.5billion of U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities, $ 27.9billion of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities, $\n6.3billion of asset-backed securities and $\n3.4billion of other securities. We changed our\nintent and committed to hold these high-\nquality securities to maturity in order to\nreduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI\nand tangible capital. The securities were\nreclassified at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer and the transfers represented non-\ncash transactions. AOCI at June 30, 2022\nincluded pretax unrealized losses of $\n5.4billion related to the transfers. These\nunrealized losses will be amortized,\nconsistent with the amortization of the\ndiscount on these securities, over the\nremaining life as an adjustment of yield,\nresulting in no impact to net interest income\nor net income.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At June 30, 2022, the allowance for\ninvestment securities was $ 137million and\nprimarily\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 51\nrelated to non-agency commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities in the available for sale\nportfolio. The comparable amount at December\n31, 2021 was $ 133million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies included in Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, AOCI included pretax losses\nof $ 141million from derivatives that hedged\nthe purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 38 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. These securities are\nsegregated between investments that had been\nin a continuous unrealized loss position for\nless than twelve months and twelve months or\nmore, based on the point in time that the fair\nvalue declined below the amortized cost basis.\nAll securities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of June\n30, 2022, we concluded that we do not intend\nto sell and believe we will not be required to\nsell these securities prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis.\nTable 38: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 42 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We manage\ncredit risk based on the risk profile of the\nborrower, repayment sources, underlying\ncollateral and other support given current\nevents, economic conditions and expectations.\nWe refine our practices to meet the changing\nenvironment resulting from rising inflation\nlevels, supply chain disruptions, higher\nrates, and secular changes fostered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance. As a result,\nunder the CARES Act credit reporting rules,\ncertain loans modified due to COVID-19 related\nhardships are not being reported as past due\nas of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period.\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nTable 42: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) (b)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table represent loans held for\ninvestment and do not include any associated\nALLL.\n(b) The accrued interest associated with our\nloan portfolio totaled $ 0.8billion and $\n0.7billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively.

This\ndecline was primarily driven by the impacts\nfrom portfolio changes and improved COVID-19\nrelated economic conditions. The following\nsummarizes the changes in these factors that\ninfluenced the ACL during the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Portfolio changes that drove reserve\ndeclines at June 30, 2022 reflected\nimprovements in credit quality, partially\noffset by the impact from loan growth in the\ncommercial and industrial portfolio.\n\n\u2022 The improved COVID-19 related economic\nconditions reduced reserves at June 30, 2022\nfor specific high-risk segments of our\ncommercial and consumer portfolios impacted by\nthe pandemic. This decline was partially\noffset by increased reserves to account for\nthe elevated risks associated with inflation\nand supply chain disruptions.\n\nN OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nAs more fully described in Note 5 Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities and Variable Interest\nEntities in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K, we\nhave transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement. Our continuing involvement in the\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, Non-\nagency securitizations and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing,\nrepurchasing previously transferred loans\nunder certain conditions and loss share\narrangements, and, in limited circumstances,\nholding of mortgage-backed securities issued\nby the securitization SPEs.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value.

In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 52.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 2.6billion at June\n30, 2022 and $ 1.8billion at December 31,\n2021, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages measured at fair value.\n\nMSRs are subject to changes in value from\nactual or expected prepayment of the\nunderlying loans and defaults, as well as\nmarket driven changes in interest rates. We\nmanage this risk by economically hedging the\nfair value of MSRs with securities, derivative\ninstruments and resale agreements which are\nexpected to increase (or decrease) in value\nwhen the value of MSRs decreases (or\nincreases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 6 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\n66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 54 and 55. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions.\n\nTable 54: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key

The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow June 30, 2022, we\nexpect to reclassify net derivative losses of\n$ 816million pretax, or $ 628million after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to June 30, 2022. As\nof June 30, 2022, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n\n84 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail regarding

These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin.

Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K and in Note 13 Legal\nProceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our first\nquarter 2022 Form 10-Q (such prior disclosure\nreferred to as \u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For\nDisclosed Matters where we are able to\nestimate such possible losses or ranges of\npossible losses, as of June 30, 2022, we\nestimate that it is reasonably possible that\nwe could incur losses in excess of related\naccrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate\namount less than $ 300million. The estimates\nincluded in this amount are based on our\nanalysis of currently available information\nand are subject to significant judgment and a\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties. As\nnew information is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item\n8 of our 2021 Form 10-K, we are unable, at\nthis time, to estimate the losses that are\nreasonably possible to be incurred or ranges\nof such losses with respect to some of the\nmatters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated\namount provided above does not include an\nestimate for every Disclosed Matter.\nTherefore, as the estimated aggregate amount\ndisclosed above does not include all of the\nDisclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above\ndoes not represent our maximum reasonably\npossible loss exposure for all of the\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn May 2022, following a jury trial in United\nServices Automobile Association v.

In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries, including those\ndescribed in Prior Disclosure.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  15 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices.

Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors.\n\nWe have allocated the ALLL and the allowance\nfor unfunded lending related commitments based\non the loan exposures within each business\nsegment\u2019s portfolio.

Basis\nadjustments related to hedged items are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities. Average\nbalances of securities are based on amortized\nhistorical cost (excluding adjustments to fair\nvalue, which are included in other assets).\nAverage balances for certain loans and\nborrowed funds accounted for at fair value are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes\nin fair value recorded in Noninterest income.\n\n(b) Loan fees for the three months ended June\n30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 were $38 million\nand $42 million, respectively.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of\n\ncommon stock repurchases depending on a number\nof factors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative\n\nuses of capital, the potential impact on our\ncredit ratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy\n\nand capital planning processes undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR\nprocess, which includes setting PNC's SCB. The\nSCB framework allows for capital returns in\namounts up to the level of capital in excess\nof the SCB minimum.
