                                           \n       Net interest margin is the total       \n       yield on interest-earning assets       \n       minus the total rate on                \n       interest-bearing liabilities and       \n       includes the benefit from use of       \n       noninterest-bearing sources. To        \n       provide more meaningful comparisons    \n       of net interest margins, we use net    \n       interest income on a                   \n       taxable-equivalent basis in            \n       calculating average yields used in     \n  (d)  the calculation of net interest        \n       margin by increasing the interest      \n       income earned on tax-exempt assets to  \n       make it fully equivalent to interest   \n       income earned on taxable investments.  \n       This adjustment is not permitted       \n       under GAAP in the Consolidated Income  \n       Statement.

Most measures of economic\nactivity contracted with enormous declines in\nconsumer spending, employment, retail sales,\nbusiness investment, industrial production and\ncorporate profitability. The unemployment rate\npeaked at 14.7% in April before declining in\nJune 2020 to a still extremely elevated level\nof 11.1%. While economic conditions have\nstarted to improve, including a rebound in\nconsumer spending and job growth, economic\nactivity remains far below its pre-recession\nlevel with real GDP not expected to return to\nits pre-recession level until 2022. There is\nstill a great deal of uncertainty about the\nlength and severity of the pandemic and the\nstrength or reversal of the economic rebound.\nThe Federal Reserve has undertaken\nextraordinary efforts to combat the economic\nweakness, reducing the federal funds rate 1.5\npercentage points in March to a range of 0.00%\nto 0.25%. The central bank put downward\npressure on long-term rates by expanding its\nbalance sheet and purchasing long-term\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cquantitative easing\u201d). The Federal Reserve\nhas also implemented multiple programs to\nsupport the flow of credit to businesses,\nconsumers, and state and local governments,\nincluding, for the first time, direct\npurchases of corporate bonds and of bank loans\nto small and medium-sized businesses. In\naddition, the federal government has\nauthorized $2.4 trillion in federal spending\nto support household incomes and businesses,\nincluding the $1.8 trillion Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The\nPNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n3 PNC is committed to putting our resources to\nwork to support our customers, communities and\nthe broader financial system. PNC is\nparticipating in the Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) under the CARES Act and funded\n$13.7 billion of PPP loans during the second\nquarter of 2020. We granted short-term loan\nmodifications for loan customers experiencing\nhardships through extensions, deferrals,\npartial payments and forbearance. In addition,\nwe have temporarily halted the majority of\nconsumer real estate related foreclosures,\nwhile we continue to monitor the situation.\nSee the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications in the Credit Risk Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nFinancial Review for details on our commercial\nand consumer loan modifications. Our retail\nbranch operations remain temporarily modified\nand have begun a gradual return to business as\nusual as we continue to prioritize the safety\nand well-being of our customers and employees.\nA majority of our branch locations have\nremained open and offer full in-branch\nservices by appointment only, as well as\noptions for ATM and, in equipped branches,\ndrive-up services. Additionally, digital and\ncall center channels have experienced elevated\ncustomer activity. See the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section of this Financial Review\nas well as the Recent Regulatory Developments\nsection in our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q\nfor additional detail on the CARES Act and\nother governmental responses to the COVID-19\npandemic and its economic and financial\nimpacts. See also Risk Factors in Part II,\nItem 1A of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q\nfor a description of the associated risks.\nSale of Equity Investment in BlackRock, Inc.\nDuring the second quarter, we divested our\nentire 22.4% investment in BlackRock. PNC\ncompleted the sale of 31.6 million shares of\nBlackRock common and preferred stock through a\nregistered secondary offering on May 15, 2020,\nand BlackRock repurchased 2.65 million shares\nfrom PNC. Total proceeds from the sale were\n$14.2 billion in cash, net of $.2 billion in\nexpenses. The after-tax gain on the sale of\n$4.3 billion , and donation expense and\nBlackRock's results for all periods presented,\nare reported as discontinued operations. After\ncompletion of the registered secondary\noffering and BlackRock's share repurchase, PNC\nretained 500,000 shares of BlackRock common\nstock. These shares were donated to the PNC\nFoundation on May 18, 2020. As a result of the\nsale and donation, PNC and its affiliates only\nhold shares of BlackRock stock in a fiduciary\ncapacity for clients of PNC and its\naffiliates.

The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 5 Business Outlook Our\nforward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views, as follow:\n                                              \n     PNC\u2019s baseline economic forecast is for  \n     an economic recovery in the second half  \n     of 2020 and into 2021, following a very  \n     severe but short recession in the first  \n     half of 2020. Consumers are increasing   \n     their spending and workers are           \n     returning to their job sites as states   \n     are gradually lifting restrictions on    \n  \u2022  businesses and activities because of     \n     the COVID-19 pandemic; fiscal stimulus   \n     from the federal government is also      \n     supporting economic growth in mid-2020.  \n     After a significant contraction in real  \n     GDP, steep job losses, and a large       \n     increase in the unemployment rate        \n     earlier in the second quarter, economic  \n     growth has resumed and the labor market  \n     is improving.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     In the baseline forecast, real GDP       \n     increases in the third quarter as        \n     consumers start to spend again. Fiscal   \n  \u2022  stimulus and extremely low interest      \n     rates support the recovery. Real GDP     \n     surpasses its pre-recession peak in      \n     2022, and growth is well above its       \n     long-term trend through 2023.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     The baseline forecast assumes that the   \n  \u2022  Federal Open Market Committee keeps the  \n     federal funds rate in its current range  \n     of 0.00% to 0.25% into 2023.             \n                                              \nGiven the many unknowns and potential downside\nrisks, including additional COVID-19\noutbreaks, our forward-looking statements are\nsubject to the risk that conditions will be\nsubstantially different than we are currently\nexpecting. If efforts to contain COVID-19 are\nunsuccessful and restrictions on businesses\nand activities are reimposed or expanded, the\neconomy could fall back into recession. The\npotential expiration of fiscal stimulus is\nalso a major downside risk. The longer the\nlabor market recovery takes, the more it will\ndamage consumer fundamentals and sentiment.\nThis could make the recovery weaker.\nSimilarly, weak near-term growth could damage\nbusiness fundamentals and an extended global\nrecession due to COVID-19 would weaken the\nU.S. recovery. As a result, the outbreak and\nits consequences, including responsive\nmeasures to manage it, have had and are likely\nto continue to have an adverse effect,\npossibly materially, on our business and\nfinancial performance by adversely affecting,\npossibly materially, the demand and\nprofitability of our products and services,\nthe valuation of assets and our ability to\nmeet the needs of our customers. For the third\nquarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter\nof 2020 , we expect:\n                                              \n  \u2022  Average loans to decline in the          \n     low-single digits percentage range;      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Net interest income to be down           \n     approximately 1%;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Noninterest income to be down between    \n  \u2022  3% and 5%, including our expectation     \n     for lower other noninterest income;      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Noninterest expense to be flat to down;  \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Net loan charge-offs to be between $250  \n     million and $350 million.                \n                                              \nFor the full year 2020, we expect total\nrevenue and noninterest expense to each be\ndown between 2% and 5% and we expect the 2020\neffective tax rate to be in the low teens\npercentage range.

C ONSOLIDATED I\nNCOME S TATEMENT R EVIEW Our Consolidated\nIncome Statement is presented in Part I, Item\n1 of this Report. Results from continuing\noperations for the second quarter of 2020 was\na net loss of $744 million, or $1.90 diluted\nloss per common share, a decrease of $ 1.9\nbillion compared to net income from continuing\noperations of $ 1.2 billion , or $2.47 per\ndiluted common share, for the second quarter\nof 2019 . For the first six months of 2020,\nnet income from continuing operations was $15\nmillion , or $0.29 diluted loss per common\nshare, compared to $ 2.3 billion , or $ 4.67\nper diluted common share, for the first six\nmonths of 2019.

See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation. Net interest income increased $29\nmillion , or 1% , and $ 65 million , or 1% ,\nfor the second quarter and first six months of\n2020 , respectively, compared with the same\nperiods in 2019 . The increase in both\ncomparisons was driven by lower rates on\nborrowings and deposits and higher average\nloans, balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank and securities, partially offset by lower\nyields on interest-earning assets. Net\ninterest margin in the quarterly comparison\ndecreased 39 basis points reflecting the full\nquarter impact of the 1.5% reduction in the\nfederal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in\nMarch 2020 and related changes in other short-\nterm rates. Average investment securities\nincreased $ 4.8 billion , or 6% , in the\nquarterly comparison and $ 3.4 billion , or 4%\nin the year-to-date comparison. The increase\nin both comparisons was primarily due to\nincreases in agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities, partially offset by a\ndecrease in U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities. The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 7 Average investment\nsecurities represented 22% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the second quarter\nof 2020 and 23% for the first six months of\n2020 compared to 24% for the same periods in\n2019. Average loans grew $33.3 billion , or\n14% , and $ 24.1 billion , or 10% , in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively. Loan growth was driven by an\nincrease in both commercial and consumer\nloans. Average commercial loans increased by\n$29.2 billion and $19.2 billion in the\nrespective comparisons, reflecting PPP lending\nunder the CARES Act and higher utilization of\nloan commitments at the end of first quarter\nand extending through most of the second\nquarter 2020, driven by the economic impact of\nthe pandemic on customer liquidity\npreferences. Average consumer loans increased\n$4.1 billion and $4.9 billion in the quarterly\nand year-to-date comparisons, respectively.\nGrowth in residential mortgage, auto, credit\ncard, and unsecured installment loans was\npartially offset by declines in education\nloans due to runoff in the guaranteed\ngovernment loan portfolio and home equity loan\npaydowns and payoffs that exceeded new\norigination volumes. Average loans represented\n67% and 68% of average interest-earning assets\nfor the second quarter of 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and 68% for the first six months\nof both 2020 and 2019. Average interest-\nearning deposits with banks increased $21.1\nbillion and $ 11.8 billion in the respective\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons, as\naverage balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank increased due to higher liquidity from\ndeposit growth and proceeds from the sale of\nour equity investment in BlackRock. Average\ninterest-bearing deposits grew $40.2 billion ,\nor 20% , and $ 29.9 billion , or 15% , in the\nrespective quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons reflecting pandemic-related\naccumulation of customer liquidity as well as\ngrowth in commercial and consumer deposits and\ncustomers. In total, average interest-bearing\ndeposits increased to 82% and 81% of average\ninterest-bearing liabilities for the second\nquarter and first six months of 2020 compared\nto 76% for the same periods in 2019. Average\nborrowed funds decreased $ 9.1 billion, or 15%\n, compared with the second quarter of 2019 and\n$ 5.9 billion , or 10% , compared with the\nfirst six months of 2019 primarily due to a\ndecline in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)\nborrowings and federal funds purchased\nreflecting use of liquidity from deposit\ngrowth and proceeds from the sale of our\nequity investment in BlackRock, partially\noffset by higher bank notes and senior and\nsubordinated debt.

PNC's\ndiscretionary client assets under management\ndecreased to $151 billion at June 30, 2020\nfrom $162 billion at June 30, 2019 , primarily\nas a result of our fourth quarter 2019 sale of\nPNC's proprietary mutual funds. Consumer\nservices revenue declined in the quarterly and\nyear-to-date comparisons as a result of lower\ntransaction volumes and activity reflecting\nlower consumer spending. Service charges on\ndeposits decreased in both comparisons due to\nlower transaction volumes and fees waived to\nassist customers as a result of the pandemic.\n8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q Corporate services revenue in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparison\nincreased due to higher revenue from\ncommercial mortgage banking activities and\nasset-backed finance structuring fees and loan\nsyndication fees, partially offset by lower\nmerger and acquisition advisory fees.\nResidential mortgage revenue increased in the\nquarterly comparison due to higher loan sales\nrevenue from higher origination volumes.\nRevenue increases in the year-to-date\ncomparison were attributable to higher\nresidential mortgage servicing rights (RMSR)\nhedging gains and loan sales revenue. The\ndecrease in other noninterest income in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons was\nprimarily attributable to negative valuation\nadjustments of private equity investments and\nthe second quarter 2019 gain on the sale of\nthe retirement recordkeeping business,\npartially offset by higher capital markets-\nrelated revenue, and higher net securities\ngains in the year-to-date comparison.\nNoninterest Expense Table 4 : Noninterest\nExpense\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe decrease in noninterest expense in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nreflected lower business activity related to\nthe economic impact of the pandemic, including\nlower marketing expense and costs associated\nwith business travel.

The provision\nfor credit losses increased $2.3 billion and $\n3.0 billion for the second quarter and first\nsix months of 2020, respectively, compared\nwith the same periods in 2019. The provision\nin the 2020 periods was calculated under the\nCECL accounting standard adopted January 1,\n2020 and the increase in both the quarterly\nand year-to-date comparison reflects the\nchange in methodology together with the\nsignificantly adverse economic impact of the\npandemic and its resulting effects on loan\nportfolio credit quality and loan growth.

The\nincrease was attributable to the $.6 billion\nday-one CECL transition adjustment and a $3.3\nbillion provision for credit losses, partially\noffset by net charge-offs of $.4 billion. The\nprovision reflects the significantly adverse\neconomic impact of the pandemic and its\nresulting effects on loan portfolio credit\nquality and loan growth.

For commercial and industrial loans\nby industry and commercial real estate loans\nby geography and property type, see Loan\nPortfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the\nCredit Risk Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of this Financial Review.\nConsumer loans declined as new originations\ndecreased due to the economic impact of the\npandemic and lower customer spending.\nResidential mortgage loans increased as the\nlow interest rate environment resulted in an\nincrease in origination volumes primarily of\nnonconforming loans, which are loans that do\nnot meet agency standards as a result of\nexceeding agency conforming loan limits.

Investment\nSecurities Investment securities of $98.5\nbillion at June 30, 2020 increased $11.7\nbillion , or 13% , compared to December 31,\n2019 , due primarily to net purchases and an\nincrease in the fair value of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 11 The level and composition\nof the investment securities portfolio\nfluctuates over time based on many factors\nincluding market conditions, loan and deposit\ngrowth, and balance sheet management\nactivities.

We have included credit ratings\ninformation because we believe that the\ninformation is an indicator of the degree of\ncredit risk to which we are exposed. Changes\nin credit ratings classifications could\nindicate increased or decreased credit risk\nand could be accompanied by a reduction or\nincrease in the fair value of our investment\nsecurities portfolio. We continually monitor\nthe credit risk in our portfolio and maintain\nthe allowance for securities at an appropriate\nlevel to absorb expected credit losses on our\ninvestment securities portfolio for the\nremaining contractual term of the securities\nadjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies and Note 3 Investment\nSecurities in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional details\nregarding the methodology for determining the\nallowance and the amount of the allowance for\ninvestment securities, respectively.

In addition, there was a\nshift from interest-bearing to noninterest-\nbearing deposits in the first six months of\n2020 that reflected the impact of the current\ninterest rate environment. Borrowed funds\ndecreased due to lower FHLB borrowings,\nfederal funds purchased included in other\nborrowed funds and bank notes and senior debt,\nreflecting the use of liquidity from deposit\ngrowth and proceeds from the sale of our\nequity investment in BlackRock. The level and\ncomposition of borrowed funds fluctuates over\ntime based on many factors including market\nconditions, loan, investment securities and\ndeposit growth, and capital considerations. We\nmanage our borrowed funds to provide a\nreliable source of liquidity for our banking\nand other activities, considering our LCR\nrequirements and other internal and external\nguidelines and constraints.

Shareholders\u2019 Equity Total\nshareholders\u2019 equity was $52.9 billion at June\n30, 2020 , an increase of $3.6 billion\ncompared to December 31, 2019. The increase\nresulted from net income of $4.6 billion\ndriven by the gain on sale of our equity\ninvestment in BlackRock and higher AOCI of\n$2.3 billion , partially offset by common\nshare repurchases of $1.3 billion, common and\npreferred stock dividends of $1.1 billion, and\na day-one transition adjustment of $.7 billion\nfor the adoption of the CECL accounting\nstandard. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a\ntemporary suspension of its common stock\nrepurchase program in conjunction with the\nFederal Reserve's effort to support the U.S.\neconomy during the pandemic, and will continue\nthe suspension through the third quarter of\n2020, with the exception of share repurchases\nto offset the effects of employee benefit\nplan-related issuances as permitted by recent\nguidance from the Federal Reserve. The\nestimated amount of these repurchases in the\nthird quarter of 2020 is $100 million, but the\ntiming and amount of executed repurchases will\nbe based on market conditions and other\nfactors.

million in\nthe first six months of 2020 compared with\nearnings of $589 million for the same period\nin 2019 . The decrease in earnings was\nattributable to higher provision for credit\nlosses and increased noninterest expense\npartially offset by higher noninterest income\nand net interest income. Net interest income\nincreased primarily due to growth in loan and\ndeposit balances and wider interest rate\nspreads on the value of loans, partially\noffset by narrower interest rate spreads on\nthe value of deposits. Noninterest income\nincreased largely due to growth in residential\nmortgage revenue attributable to higher\nresults from residential mortgage servicing\nrights valuation, net of economic hedge, and\nincreased loan sales revenue from higher\norigination volumes partially offset by\nservice charges on deposits and consumer\nservices fees reflecting lower transaction\nvolumes, fees waived to assist customers in\nthe pandemic and lower consumer spending. The\nincrease in noninterest income was also driven\nby lower negative derivative fair value\nadjustments related to Visa Class B common\nshares of $24 million for the first six months\nof 2020 compared with the negative adjustments\nof $47 million for the same period in 2019. 16\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q Provision for credit losses increased in\nthe first six months of 2020 compared to the\nsame period in 2019 reflecting changes in\nmethodology due to the adoption of the CECL\naccounting standard, together with the\nsignificantly adverse economic impact of the\npandemic. Higher noninterest expense primarily\nresulted from higher personnel, equipment and\nbranch-related expenses, partially offset by\nlower advertising and marketing. The deposit\nstrategy of Retail Banking is to remain\ndisciplined on pricing and focused on growing\nand retaining relationship-based balances,\nexecuting on market-specific deposit growth\nstrategies and providing a source of low-cost\nfunding and liquidity to PNC. In the first six\nmonths of 2020 , average total deposits\nincreased compared to the same period in 2019\nprimarily driven by savings deposits which\nincreased due, in part, to a shift from money\nmarket deposits to relationship-based savings\nproducts as well as growth in demand deposits.\nSavings and demand deposits also benefited\nfrom the impact of government stimulus\npayments and lower consumer spending due to\nthe pandemic. Retail Banking average total\nloans increased in the first six months of\n2020 compared with the same period in 2019 .\n                                              \n     Average residential mortgages increased  \n     primarily as a result of growth in       \n  \u2022  nonconforming residential mortgage       \n     loans and a robust refinance market      \n     driven by historically low interest      \n     rates.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average auto loans increased primarily   \n  \u2022  due to strong new indirect auto loan     \n     volumes, including in our Southeast and  \n     expansion markets.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Average commercial loans increased       \n     primarily due to PPP loans.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average credit card balances increased   \n     as we continued to focus on our          \n  \u2022  long-term objective of deepening         \n     penetration within our existing          \n     customer base as well as new client      \n     acquisition.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average unsecured installment loans      \n  \u2022  increased primarily driven by growth in  \n     originations through digital channels.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average education loans decreased        \n  \u2022  driven by a decline in the runoff        \n     portfolio of government guaranteed       \n     education loans.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average home equity loans decreased as   \n  \u2022  paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded   \n     new originated volume.                   \n                                              \nIn 2018, we launched our national expansion\nstrategy designed to grow customers with\ndigitally-led banking and an ultra-thin branch\nnetwork in markets outside of our existing\nretail branch network and began offering a\ndigital high yield savings deposit product and\nopened our first solution center in Kansas\nCity.

Higher provision for credit\nlosses was partially offset by higher revenue.\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison, primarily due to higher average\nloan and deposit balances, partially offset by\nnarrower interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits. Growth in noninterest income in the\ncomparison reflected broad-based increases\nincluding higher capital markets-related\nrevenue and higher revenue from commercial\nmortgage banking activities. Provision for\ncredit losses increased in the first six\nmonths of 2020 compared to the same period in\n2019 reflecting changes in methodology due to\nthe adoption of the CECL accounting standard,\ntogether with the significantly adverse\neconomic impact of the pandemic and its\nresulting effects on loan portfolio credit\nquality and loan growth. The first six months\nof 2020 experienced an increase in\nnonperforming assets and net loan and lease\ncharge-offs compared to the same period in\n2019 primarily related to industries\neconomically impacted by the pandemic and the\nenergy industry. Noninterest expense increased\nin the comparison largely due to investments\nin strategic initiatives, mostly offset by\nlower variable costs associated with decreased\nbusiness activity related to the pandemic.\nAverage loans increased in the comparison\nacross all businesses primarily due to\nincreased utilization of loan commitments\ndriven by the economic impact of the pandemic\non customer liquidity preferences and the\nimpact of PPP loan originations:\n                                              \n     Corporate Banking provides lending,      \n     treasury management and capital          \n     markets-related products and services    \n     to mid-sized and large corporations,     \n  \u2022  and government and not-for-profit        \n     entities.

earned $82 million in\nthe first six months of 2020 compared with\nearnings of $125 million for the same period\nin 2019 . Earnings decreased due to lower\nrevenue and higher provision for credit\nlosses, partially offset by lower noninterest\nexpense. The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 21 Net interest income\nincreased due to higher average loan and\ndeposit balances partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits. Noninterest income decreased due to\nlower asset management fees resulting from the\nimpact of 2019 divestiture activities and the\n2019 gain on the sale of the retirement\nrecordkeeping business. Noninterest expense\ndecreased in the comparison and was primarily\nattributable to the impact of the 2019\ndivestitures. Provision for credit losses\nincreased reflecting changes in methodology\ndue to the adoption of the CECL accounting\nstandard, together with the significantly\nadverse economic impact of the pandemic. Asset\nManagement Group\u2019s discretionary client assets\nunder management decreased in comparison to\nthe prior year primarily attributable to the\nsale of components of the PNC Capital Advisors\ninvestment management business.

R ISK M ANAGEMENT The Risk\nManagement section included in Item 7 of our\n2019 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk\nmanagement framework including risk culture,\nenterprise strategy, risk governance and\nframework, risk identification, risk\nassessment, risk controls and monitoring, and\nrisk aggregation and reporting. Additionally,\nour 2019 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our\nkey areas of risk, which include but are not\nlimited to credit, liquidity and capital,\nmarket, operational, compliance and\ninformation security. Credit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with contractual terms.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business and results from extending\ncredit to customers, purchasing securities,\nand entering into financial derivative\ntransactions and certain guarantee contracts.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant\nrisks. Our processes for managing credit risk\nare embedded in our risk culture and in our\ndecision-making processes using a systematic\napproach whereby credit risks and related\nexposures are identified and assessed, managed\nthrough specific policies and processes,\nmeasured and evaluated against our risk\nappetite and credit concentration limits, and\nreported, along with specific mitigation\nactivities, to management and the Board of\nDirectors through our governance structure.\nOur most significant concentration of credit\nrisk is in our loan portfolio. 22 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\nLoan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis\nTable 15 : Details of Loans In billions We use\nseveral credit quality indicators, as further\ndetailed in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance\nfor Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in this Report, to\nmonitor and measure our exposure to credit\nrisk within our loan portfolio. The following\nprovides additional information about our\nsignificant loan classes. Commercial\nCommercial and Industrial Commercial and\nindustrial loans comprised 56% and 52% of our\ntotal loan portfolio at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. The majority\nof our commercial and industrial loans are\nsecured by collateral that provides a\nsecondary source of repayment for the loan\nshould the borrower experience cash generation\ndifficulties. Examples of this collateral\ninclude short-term assets, such as accounts\nreceivable, inventory and securities, and\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment, real\nestate and other business assets. We actively\nmanage our commercial and industrial loans to\nassess any changes (both positive and\nnegative) in the level of credit risk at both\nthe borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate\nthe level of credit risk, we assign internal\nrisk ratings reflecting our estimates of the\nborrower\u2019s probability of default (PD) and\nloss given default (LGD) for each related\ncredit facility. This two-dimensional credit\nrisk rating methodology provides granularity\nin the risk monitoring process and is updated\non an ongoing basis through our credit risk\nmanagement processes. In addition to\nmonitoring the level of credit risk, we also\nmonitor concentrations of credit risk\npertaining to both specific industries and\ngeography that may exist in our portfolio. Our\ncommercial and industrial portfolio is well-\ndiversified as shown in the following table\nwhich provides a breakout by industry\nclassification (classified based on the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System\n(NAICS)).

The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 23\nCommercial and industrial loan increases at\nJune 30, 2020 were driven by loan growth,\nincluding the impact of PPP lending under the\nCARES Act and higher utilization of loan\ncommitments driven by the economic impact of\nthe pandemic on customer liquidity\npreferences. See the Commercial High Impact\nIndustries discussion within this Credit Risk\nManagement for additional discussion of the\nimpact of COVID-19 on our commercial portfolio\nand how we are evaluating and monitoring the\nportfolio for elevated levels of credit risk.\nCommercial Real Estate Commercial real estate\nloans comprised $17.5 billion related to\ncommercial mortgages, $6.4 billion of real\nestate project loans and $4.9 billion of\nintermediate term financing loans as of June\n30, 2020 . Comparable amounts were $17.0\nbillion , $5.6 billion and $5.5 billion ,\nrespectively, as of December 31, 2019 . We\nmonitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith these types of credit activities tend to\nbe correlated to the loan structure,\ncollateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk.

We continue\nto carefully monitor and manage these loans,\nand while we have not yet experienced material\ncharge-offs in these industries, we expect to\nsee charge-offs increase over time if the\ncurrent economic trends continue. In our non-\nreal estate related category we have $11.5\nbillion in loans outstanding, $2.0 billion of\nwhich are funded through the PPP and\nguaranteed by the Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) under the CARES Act.\nNonperforming loans in these industries\ntotaled $.1 billion, or .9% of total loans\noutstanding in the non-real estate related\ncategory, while criticized assets totaled $1.0\nbillion at June 30, 2020 with the greatest\nstress seen in the leisure recreation and\nleisure travel sectors. Within the commercial\nreal estate related category, we have $8.1\nbillion in loans outstanding which includes\nreal estate projects of $4.8 billion.\nNonperforming loans in this category totaled\n$.1 billion at June 30, 2020, or 1.2% of total\nloans outstanding in the commercial real\nestate related category, driven primarily by\none real estate investment trust related loan.\nIn this category, we continue to see\nsubstantial stress in the non-essential retail\nand hotel segments. Oil and Gas Loan Portfolio\nWe are also monitoring our oil and gas\nportfolio closely for elevated levels of\ncredit risk given the continued pressures on\nthe energy industry. As of June 30, 2020 , our\noutstanding loans in the oil and gas sector\ntotaled $4.1 billion or 1.6% of total loans,\nwhich includes $.1 billion funded through the\nPPP and guaranteed by the SBA under the CARES\nAct. This portfolio comprised approximately\n$1.9 billion in the midstream and downstream\nsectors, $1.1 billion of oil services\ncompanies and $1.1 billion related to\nexploration and production companies. Of the\noil services category, approximately $.2\nbillion is not asset-based or investment\ngrade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas\nsector as of June 30, 2020 totaled $.2\nbillion, or 4.9% of total loans outstanding in\nthis sector. Additional unfunded loan\ncommitments in the oil and gas portfolio\ntotaled $6.9 billion at June 30, 2020.\nConsumer Home Equity Home equity loans\ncomprised $ 13.3 billion of primarily\nvariable-rate home equity lines of credit and\n$ 11.6 billion of closed-end home equity\ninstallment loans at June 30, 2020 .\nComparable amounts were $13.9 billion and\n$11.2 billion , respectively, as of December\n31, 2019 . We track borrower performance\nmonthly, including obtaining original LTVs,\nupdated FICO scores at least quarterly,\nupdated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other\ncredit metrics at least quarterly, including\nthe historical performance of any related\nmortgage loans regardless of lien position\nthat we do or do not hold. This information is\nused for internal reporting and risk\nmanagement. For internal reporting and risk\nmanagement we also segment the population into\npools based on product type ( e.g. , home\nequity loans, brokered home equity loans, home\nequity lines of credit, brokered home equity\nlines of credit). As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon the loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien\nposition and geographic concentration. The\ncredit quality of newly originated loans over\nthe last twelve months was strong overall with\na weighted-average LTV on originations of 68%\nand a weighted-average FICO score of 770 . The\ncredit performance of the majority of the home\nequity portfolio where we hold the first lien\nposition is superior to the portion of the\nportfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien.

We track borrower\nperformance of this portfolio monthly\nsimilarly to home equity loans. This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. For internal reporting and\nrisk management we also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming, conforming). As part of\nour overall risk analysis and monitoring, we\nalso segment the portfolio based upon loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV and geographic concentrations.\nLoan performance is evaluated by source\noriginators and loan servicers. The credit\nquality of newly originated loans that we\nretained on our balance sheet over the last\ntwelve months was strong overall as evidenced\nby a weighted-average LTV on originations of\n69% and a weighted-average FICO score of 771 .\nThe following table presents our residential\nreal estate loans by geography.

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. The originated\nnonconforming residential mortgage portfolio\nhad strong credit quality at June 30, 2020\nwith an average original LTV of 69% and an\naverage original FICO score of 773 . Our\nportfolio of originated nonconforming\nresidential mortgage loans totaled $17.4\nbillion at June 30, 2020 with 40% located in\nCalifornia. Automobile Within auto loans, $\n14.5 billion resided in the indirect auto\nportfolio while $ 1.7 billion were in the\ndirect auto portfolio as of June 30, 2020 .\nComparable amounts as of December 31, 2019\nwere $15.1 billion and $1.7 billion ,\nrespectively. The indirect auto portfolio\npertains to loans originated through\nfranchised dealers, including from expansion\ninto new markets. This business is\nstrategically aligned with our core retail\nbanking business. We continue to focus on\nborrowers with strong credit profiles as\nevidenced by a weighted-average loan\norigination FICO score over the last twelve\nmonths of 765 for indirect auto loans and 769\nfor direct auto loans. The weighted-average\nterm of loan originations over the last twelve\nmonths was 73 months for indirect auto loans\nand 63 months for direct auto loans. We offer\nboth new and used auto financing to customers\nthrough our various channels. At June 30, 2020\n, the portfolio was composed of 56% new\nvehicle loans and 44% used vehicle loans.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were\n55% and 45%, respectively. The auto loan\nportfolio's performance is measured monthly,\nincluding updated collateral values that are\nobtained monthly and updated FICO scores that\nare obtained at least quarterly. For internal\nreporting and risk management, we analyze the\nportfolio by product channel and product type\nand regularly evaluate default and delinquency\nexperience. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we segment the\nportfolio by loan structure, collateral\nattributes and credit metrics which include\nFICO score, LTV and term. Nonperforming Assets\nand Loan Delinquencies Nonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming\nloans and leases for which ultimate\ncollectability of the full amount of\ncontractual principal and interest is not\nprobable and include nonperforming troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate\nowned (OREO) and foreclosed assets. Loans held\nfor sale, certain government insured or\nguaranteed loans and loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option are excluded from\nnonperforming loans. Amounts as of December\n31, 2019 also excluded purchased impaired\nloans as we were accreting interest income\nover the expected life of the loans. In\nconnection with the adoption of the CECL\nstandard, nonperforming loans as of June 30,\n2020 include purchased credit deteriorated\n(PCD) loans which meet the criteria to be\nclassified as nonperforming.

As of\nJune 30, 2020 , commercial nonperforming loans\nwere carried at approximately 78% of their\nunpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs\nrecorded to date, before consideration of the\nALLL. Within consumer nonperforming loans,\nresidential real estate TDRs comprised 77% and\n79% of total residential real estate\nnonperforming loans at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively, while home\nequity TDRs comprised 45% and 49% of home\nequity nonperforming loans at June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 , respectively. TDRs\ngenerally remain in nonperforming status until\na borrower has made at least six consecutive\nmonths of both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms or ultimate\nresolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus and loans to borrowers not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Loans that have\nbeen restructured for COVID-19 related\nhardships and meet certain criteria under the\nCARES Act are not identified as TDRs.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and at June 30, 2020\nalso include PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans\nheld for sale, while amounts as of December\n31, 2019 also excluded purchased impaired\nloans. Pursuant to the interagency guidance\nissued in April 2020 and in connection with\nthe credit reporting rules from the CARES Act,\nthe delinquency status of loans modified due\nto COVID-19 related hardships are being\nreported as of June 30, 2020 in alignment with\nthe rules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows: (i) if\ncurrent at the time of modification, the loan\nremains current throughout the modification\nperiod, (ii) if delinquent at the time of\nmodification and the borrower was not made\ncurrent as part of the modification, the loan\nmaintains its reported as delinquent status\nduring the modification period, or (iii) if\ndelinquent at the time of modification and the\nborrower was made current as part of the\nmodification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent. As a result, certain loans modified\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships are not\nbeing reported as past due as of June 30, 2020\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period.

Troubled\nDebt Restructurings and Loan Modifications\nTroubled Debt Restructurings A TDR is a loan\nwhose terms have been restructured in a manner\nthat grants a concession to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulties. TDRs\nresult from our loss mitigation activities and\ninclude rate reductions, principal\nforgiveness, postponement/reduction of\nscheduled amortization and extensions, which\nare intended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that meet certain\ncriteria under the CARES Act are not\ncategorized as TDRs.

For\nadditional information on the CARES Act, see\nthe Recent Regulatory Developments section in\nItem 2 of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nLoan Modifications PNC is working to provide\nrelief and flexibility to our customers, many\nof whom are suffering hardships as a result of\nCOVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn,\nthrough a variety of solutions, including\ngranting loan and lease modifications. We\ncontinue to monitor the success rates and\ndelinquency status of our loan and lease\nmodification programs to assess their\neffectiveness in serving our borrowers\u2019 and\nservicing customers\u2019 needs while mitigating\ncredit losses. Due to the passage of the CARES\nAct, loan modifications meeting certain\ncriteria qualify the loan for relief from TDR\ntreatment. These criteria include (i) the loan\nmodification results from a COVID-19 related\nhardship, (ii) the borrower is no more than 30\ndays past due as of December 31, 2019, and\n(iii) the loan modification does not result in\na permanent reduction of interest or\nprincipal. Loans that do not meet the criteria\nfor TDR relief under the CARES Act may be\nevaluated under interagency guidance, which\nallows banks to not designate certain short-\nterm modifications as TDRs for borrowers with\nCOVID-19 hardships who were current on their\npayments prior to the modification. Loans that\nare permanently modified or receive longer\nterm modifications under programs involving a\nchange to loan terms due to customer financial\ndifficulty and PNC concessions are evaluated\nfor TDR accounting. Refer to the Loan\nDelinquencies discussion in this Credit Risk\nManagement section for information on how\nthese hardship related loan modification are\nreported from a delinquency perspective as of\nJune 30, 2020. For additional information on\nthe CARES Act and interagency guidance, see\nthe Recent Regulatory Developments section in\nItem 2 of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nThe impact of modifications made through one\nof the hardship programs was considered within\nthe modified loans\u2019 quarterly reserve\ndetermination. See the Allowance for Credit\nLosses discussion within this Credit Risk\nManagement for additional information.\nCommercial Loan and Lease Modifications Under\nCOVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs PNC is\ngranting temporary loan and lease\nmodifications to our commercial clients in the\nform of principal and/or interest deferrals,\ncovenant waivers and other types of\nmodifications including term extensions.\nInitial principal and/or interest deferrals\nare being offered with terms typically up to\n90 days, and we are analyzing and making\ndecisions on these modifications based on each\nindividual borrower\u2019s situation. Modifications\nmade in the form of covenant waivers include\nmodifying financial covenants, waiving\ncovenants currently in default, amending\nreporting requirements and waiving the receipt\nof required reporting. The following table\npresents a summary as of June 30, 2020 of the\nprincipal and/or interest deferral\nmodifications PNC has granted due to COVID-19\nrelated hardships in the commercial portfolio.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the unpaid principal\nbalance on these modifications represented\napproximately 4% of the total commercial loan\nportfolio. In some cases, individual loans\nhave been modified more than once. Regardless\nof the number of modifications granted on a\nloan, each loan is counted only once in Table\n24 .

The method of collection\nof the accrued interest is dependent on the\nproduct type and modification offered. The\nfollowing table presents a summary as of June\n30, 2020 of the hardship related loan\nmodifications PNC has granted in our consumer\nloan portfolio during 2020. As of June 30,\n2020, the unpaid principal balance on these\nmodifications represented approximately 8% of\nthe total consumer loan portfolio. In some\ncases, there have been multiple modifications\nof individual loans. Regardless of the number\nof modifications granted on a loan, each loan\nis counted only once in Table 25 .

The\ninitial consumer loan modifications granted in\nresponse to the COVID-19 outbreak and the\nsurrounding economic circumstances were short-\nterm and temporary in nature and generally\nmeet the qualifications for relief from TDR\ntreatment under the CARES Act. However, in\nresponse to customers' hardships that have\nextended beyond the initial relief period, PNC\ncontinues to offer options to customers which\ninclude both temporary and permanent\nmodifications that may reduce the payment, the\ninterest rate or extend the term and/or defer\nprincipal and interest payments. Permanent\nmodifications would not meet the\nqualifications for relief from TDR treatment\nunder the CARES Act. The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 31 Allowance\nfor Credit Losses On January 1, 2020 we\nadopted the CECL standard which replaced the\nincurred loss methodology for our credit\nrelated reserves with an expected credit loss\nmethodology for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of in-scope assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures. Our ACL is based on\nhistorical loss experience, borrower\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, finance leases, trade\nreceivables and other financial assets and\noff-balance sheet credit exposures and\ndetermine this allowance based on quarterly\nassessments of the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures as\nof the balance sheet date. Expected losses are\nestimated using a combination of (i) the\nexpected losses over a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period (RSFP), (ii) a\nperiod of reversion to long run average\nexpected losses (reversion period) where\napplicable, and (iii) long run average (LRA)\nexpected losses for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term. We use forward-looking\ninformation in estimating expected credit\nlosses for the RSFP. For this purpose, we have\nestablished a framework which includes a three\nyear reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the use of four economic scenarios\nand associated probability weights, which in\ncombination create a forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes over our RSFP of three\nyears. Forward looking information, such as\nforecasted relevant macroeconomic variables,\nis incorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates using quantitative techniques, as\nwell as through analysis from PNC's economists\nand management\u2019s judgment in qualitatively\nassessing the ACL. The reversion period is\nused to bridge RSFP and LRA expected credit\nlosses. We may consider a number of factors in\ndetermining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of RSFP\nrelative to the beginning of the LRA period.\nThe LRA expected credit losses are derived\nfrom our available historical credit\ninformation. We use LRA expected loss for the\nportfolio for the estimated remaining\ncontractual term beyond the RSFP and reversion\nperiod. The following discussion provides\nadditional information related to our reserves\nunder CECL for loans and leases as well as\nunfunded lending related commitments. See Note\n1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this\nReport for further discussion on our ACL,\nincluding details of our methodologies and\ndiscussion of the allowances for investment\nsecurities and other financial assets. See\nalso the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section of this Financial Review for\nfurther discussion of the assumptions used in\nthe determination of the ACL and the predicted\nimpacts on the ACL of deteriorating economic\nconditions as a result of COVID-19. Allowance\nfor Loan and Lease Losses Our pooled expected\nloss methodology is based upon the\nquantification of PD, LGD, exposure at default\n(EAD) and the remaining estimated contractual\nterm for a loan or loan segment. We also\nconsider the impact of prepayments and\namortization on contractual maturity in our\nexpected loss estimates. We use historical\ndata, current borrower characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables in quantitative\nmethods, including statistical models, to\nestimate these risk parameters by credit risk\ncharacteristics. PDs represent a\nquantification of risk that a borrower may not\nbe able to pay their contractual obligation\nover a defined period of time. LGD describes\nthe estimate of potential loss if a borrower\nwere to default, and EAD (or utilization rates\nfor revolving loans) is the estimated balance\noutstanding at the time of default and loss.\nThese parameters are calculated for each\nforecasted scenario, and are combined to\ngenerate expected loss estimates by scenario\nin proportion to the scenario weights. We use\na discounted cash flow methodology for our\nconsumer real estate related loan classes and\nfor certain commercial and consumer TDR loans.\nFor non-TDR residential real estate loans and\nlines, we determine effective interest rates\nconsidering contractual cash flows adjusted\nfor prepayments and market interest rates. We\nthen determine the net present value of\nexpected cash flows and ALLL by discounting\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for both\nprepayments and expected credit losses using\nthe effective interest rates. We establish\nindividually assessed reserves for loans and\nleases that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics with a pool of loans using\nmethods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for\nindividual commercial nonperforming loans and\ncommercial TDRs exceeding a defined dollar\nthreshold are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Commercial\nloans that are below the defined threshold and\naccruing TDRs are collectively reserved for,\nas we believe these loans continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. For consumer\nnonperforming loans classified as collateral\ndependent, charge-off and ALLL related to\nrecovery of amounts previously charged-off are\nevaluated through an analysis of the fair\nvalue of the collateral less costs to sell.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 32 While our reserve methodologies strive\nto reflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses attributable to such risks. A\nportion of the allowance is related to\nqualitative measurement factors.

The\nincrease in commercial net charge-offs\nreflected the impact of certain individual\ncredits, while the increases in automobile,\ncredit card and other consumer loan net\ncharge-offs were due in part to loan portfolio\ngrowth. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and\nNote 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in this report for additional\ninformation. Liquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity risk, including our liquidity\nmonitoring measures and tools, is described in\nfurther detail in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement section of our 2019 Form 10-K. One\nof the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity\nrequirement designed to ensure that covered\nbanking organizations maintain an adequate\nlevel of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs\nover the course of a hypothetical 30-day\nstress scenario. The LCR is calculated by\ndividing the amount of an institution\u2019s high\nquality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as\ndefined and calculated in accordance with the\nLCR rules, by its estimated, weighted net cash\noutflows, with net cash outflows determined by\napplying the assumed outflow factors in the\nLCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed\nas a percentage. Effective January 1, 2020,\nPNC and PNC Bank, as Category III institutions\nunder the Tailoring Rules, were subject to a\nreduced LCR requirement, with each company's\nnet outflows reduced by 15%, thereby reducing\nthe amount of HQLA each institution must hold\nto meet the LCR minimum requirement. The\nminimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required\nto 34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q maintain continues to be 100%. PNC\nand PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as\nof June 30, 2020 , the LCR for PNC and PNC\nBank exceeded the requirement of 100%. We\nprovide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2019 Form 10-K. Sources\nof Liquidity Our largest source of liquidity\non a consolidated basis is the customer\ndeposit base generated by our banking\nbusinesses. These deposits provide relatively\nstable and low-cost funding. Total deposits\nincreased to $ 346.0 billion at June 30, 2020\nfrom $288.5 billion at December 31, 2019\ndriven by growth in both interest-bearing and\nnoninterest-bearing deposits. See the Funding\nSources portion of the Consolidated Balance\nSheet Review section of this Financial Review\nfor additional information related to our\ndeposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position. At June 30, 2020 , our\nliquid assets consisted of cash and due from\nbanks and short-term investments (federal\nfunds sold, resale agreements, trading\nsecurities and interest-earning deposits with\nbanks) totaling $ 61.6 billion and securities\navailable for sale totaling $ 97.1 billion.\nThe level of liquid assets fluctuates over\ntime based on many factors, including market\nconditions, loan and deposit growth and\nbalance sheet management activities. Our\nliquid assets included $ 23.4 billion of\nsecurities available for sale and trading\nsecurities pledged as collateral to secure\npublic and trust deposits, repurchase\nagreements and for other purposes. In\naddition, $.1 billion of securities held to\nmaturity were also pledged as collateral for\nthese purposes. We also obtain liquidity\nthrough various forms of funding, including\nlong-term debt (senior notes, subordinated\ndebt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term\nborrowings (securities sold under repurchase\nagreements, commercial paper and other short-\nterm borrowings). See Note 8 Borrowed Funds in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nand the Funding Sources section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet Review in this\nReport, and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in Item 8\nof our 2019 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation related to our borrowings. Total\nsenior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, increased due to the\nfollowing activity: Table 28 : Senior and\nSubordinated Debt\n                                    \n  In billions              2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01             $  35.1     \n  Issuances                 3.5     \n  Calls and maturities     (5.9  )  \n  Other                     1.5     \n  June 30               $  34.2     \n                                    \nBank Liquidity Under PNC Bank\u2019s 2014 bank note\nprogram, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to\ntime offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding at any one time\nof its unsecured senior and subordinated notes\nwith maturity dates more than nine months (in\nthe case of senior notes) and five years or\nmore (in the case of subordinated notes) from\ntheir date of issue. At June 30, 2020 , PNC\nBank had $ 21.6 billion of notes outstanding\nunder this program of which $ 16.6 billion\nwere senior bank notes and $ 5.0 billion were\nsubordinated bank notes. PNC Bank maintains\nadditional secured borrowing capacity with the\nFHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal\nReserve Bank discount window. The Federal\nReserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a\nprimary means of funding our routine business\nactivities, but rather as a potential source\nof liquidity in a stressed environment or\nduring a market disruption. At June 30, 2020 ,\nour unused secured borrowing capacity at the\nFHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank\ntotaled $ 80.8 billion. The Federal Reserve\nalso has established certain special liquidity\nfacilities under its emergency lending\nauthority in Section 13(3) of the Federal\nReserve Act in response to the economic impact\nof the pandemic. For additional information on\nthese special liquidity facilities see the\nRecent Regulatory Developments section of the\nfirst quarter 2020 Form 10-Q. PNC Bank has the\nability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its\ncommercial paper to provide additional\nliquidity. As of June 30, 2020 , there were no\nissuances outstanding under this program. From\ntime to time, the parent company may make\ncapital contributions to PNC Bank. In the\nsecond quarter of 2020, a capital contribution\nto PNC Bank of $2.5 billion was made by the\nparent company. The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 35 Parent Company\nLiquidity In addition to managing liquidity\nrisk at the bank level, we monitor the parent\ncompany\u2019s liquidity. The parent company\u2019s\ncontractual obligations consist primarily of\ndebt service related to parent company\nborrowings and funding non-bank affiliates.\nAdditionally, the parent company maintains\nadequate liquidity to fund discretionary\nactivities such as paying dividends to our\nshareholders, share repurchases and\nacquisitions. As of June 30, 2020 , available\nparent company liquidity totaled $ 17.7\nbillion which includes proceeds from our\nsecond quarter 2020 sale of our equity\ninvestment in BlackRock. See Note 2\nDiscontinued Operations in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements of this\nReport for additional information. Parent\ncompany liquidity is primarily held in\nintercompany short-term investments, the terms\nof which provide for the availability of cash\nin 31 days or less. Investments with longer\ndurations may also be acquired, but if so, the\nrelated maturities are aligned with scheduled\ncash needs, such as the maturity of parent\ncompany debt obligations. The principal source\nof parent company liquidity is the dividends\nit receives from PNC Bank, which may be\nimpacted by the following:\n                                \n  \u2022  Bank-level capital needs,  \n                                \n                            \n  \u2022  Laws and regulations,  \n                            \n                          \n  \u2022  Corporate policies,  \n                          \n                                    \n  \u2022  Contractual restrictions, and  \n                                    \n                     \n  \u2022  Other factors.  \n                     \nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was approximately $ 1.8 billion at\nJune 30, 2020 . See Note 18 Regulatory Matters\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in our 2019 Form 10-K for a further\ndiscussion of these limitations. In addition\nto dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of\nparent company liquidity include cash and\ninvestments, as well as dividends and loan\nrepayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. The parent company has the\nability to offer up to $5.0 billion of\ncommercial paper to provide additional\nliquidity. As of June 30, 2020 , there were no\ncommercial paper issuances outstanding. The\nparent company has an effective shelf\nregistration statement pursuant to which we\ncan issue additional debt, equity and other\ncapital instruments. Parent company senior and\nsubordinated debt outstanding totaled $ 11.5\nbillion and $9.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. Contractual\nObligations and Commitments We have\ncontractual obligations representing required\nfuture payments on borrowed funds, time\ndeposits, leases, pension and postretirement\nbenefits and purchase obligations. See the\nLiquidity and Capital Management portion of\nthe Risk Management section in our 2019 Form\n10-K for more information on these future cash\noutflows. Additionally, in the normal course\nof business we have various commitments\noutstanding, certain of which are not included\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide\ninformation on our commitments in Note 9\nCommitments in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of this Report. Credit\nRatings PNC\u2019s credit ratings affect the cost\nand availability of short and long-term\nfunding, collateral requirements for certain\nderivative instruments and the ability to\noffer certain products. In general, rating\nagencies base their ratings on many\nquantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding capital adequacy, liquidity, asset\nquality, business mix, level and quality of\nearnings, and the current legislative and\nregulatory environment, including implied\ngovernment support. A decrease, or potential\ndecrease, in credit ratings could impact\naccess to the capital markets and/or increase\nthe cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect\nliquidity and financial condition. 36 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\nTable 29 : Credit Ratings for PNC and PNC Bank\n                                              \n                         June 30,             \n                         2020                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                Moody\u2019s  Standard\u00a0&    Fitch  \n                         Poor\u2019s               \n  PNC                                         \n  Senior debt   A3       A-            A+     \n  Subordinated  A3       BBB+          A-     \n  debt                                        \n  Preferred     Baa2     BBB-          BBB    \n  stock                                       \n  PNC Bank                                    \n  Senior debt   A2       A             A+     \n  Subordinated  A3       A-            A      \n  debt                                        \n  Long-term     Aa2      A             AA-    \n  deposits                                    \n  Short-term    P-1      A-1           F1+    \n  deposits                                    \n  Short-term    P-1      A-1           F1     \n  notes                                       \n                                              \nOn July 10, 2020, Fitch downgraded PNC's\nsenior debt rating from A+ to A in conjunction\nwith the finalization of ratings methodology\nchanges for Category II and III banking\norganizations. The ratings downgrade was\nsolely a function of criteria changes and does\nnot reflect a change in Fitch\u2019s current or\nexpected view of PNC\u2019s credit fundamentals. No\nimpact to PNC or its businesses is expected as\na result of this downgrade. Additionally, PNC\nBank\u2019s senior unsecured and subordinated debt\nratings were affirmed at A+ and A,\nrespectively. Capital Management Detailed\ninformation on our capital management\nprocesses and activities, including additional\ninformation on our previous CCAR submissions\nand capital plans, is included in the Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection in our 2019 Form 10-K. We manage our\nfunding and capital positions by making\nadjustments to our balance sheet size and\ncomposition, issuing or redeeming debt,\nissuing equity or other capital instruments,\nexecuting treasury stock transactions and\ncapital redemptions or repurchases, and\nmanaging dividend policies and retaining\nearnings. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a\ntemporary suspension of our common stock\nrepurchase program in conjunction with the\nFederal Reserve's effort to support the U.S.\neconomy during the pandemic, and will continue\nthe suspension through the third quarter of\n2020, with the exception of share repurchases\nto offset the effects of employee benefit\nplan-related issuances as permitted by recent\nguidance from the Federal Reserve. The\nestimated amount of these repurchases in the\nthird quarter of 2020 is $100 million, but the\ntiming and amount of executed repurchases will\nbe based on market conditions and other\nfactors. We paid dividends on common stock of\n$.5 billion, or $1.15 per common share, during\nthe second quarter of 2020. The PNC Board of\nDirectors declared a quarterly cash dividend\non common stock payable on August 5, 2020 of\n$1.15 per share, consistent with the second\nquarter dividend paid on May 5, 2020. In April\n2020, PNC submitted its capital plan to the\nFederal Reserve and OCC as part of the 2020\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act stress\ntesting (DFAST) process. On June 25, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve released the results of its\nsupervisory stress tests conducted as part of\nthe 2020 CCAR/DFAST process, as well as the\nresults of additional sensitivity analysis it\nconducted to account for the uncertainty\npresented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on\nthe results of the Federal Reserve's\nsupervisory stress tests, PNC's Stress Capital\nBuffer (SCB), which is scheduled to go into\neffect on October 1, 2020, was set at 2.5%,\nthe minimum level permitted under applicable\nrules. For additional information on the SCB\nand its potential impact on PNC's capital\ndistributions, see the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section of the Financial Review\nof our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q. Following\ncompletion of the 2020 CCAR/DFAST process, the\nFederal Reserve announced certain limitations\non the capital distributions of any CCAR-\nparticipating bank holding company (including\nPNC) during the third quarter of 2020. Under\nthese limitations, PNC and other CCAR-\nparticipating firms, absent Federal Reserve\napproval, are permitted to make only the\nfollowing capital distributions during the\nthird quarter of 2020:\n                                              \n     Pay common dividends at the same per     \n     share level as paid during the second    \n  \u2022  quarter of 2020, provided that the       \n     amount does not exceed the average of    \n     the firm's net income for the four       \n     preceding calendar quarters;             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Purchase common shares in an amount      \n  \u2022  that equals the amount of share          \n     issuances related to expensed employee   \n     compensation; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Make scheduled payments on additional    \n     Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments.   \n                                              \nThe Federal Reserve has indicated that it\nreserves the right to extend these limitations\nto additional quarters, potentially in\nmodified form. The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 37 In June 2020, the\nFederal Reserve also announced that all 2020\nCCAR-participating firms (including PNC) would\nbe required to conduct an additional round of\ncompany and supervisory stress tests in the\nfourth quarter of 2020 using updated baseline\nand stressed scenarios that better incorporate\nthe current, expected and potential effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve has\nindicated it will provide updated supervisory\nscenarios to firms by September 30, 2020, and\nstress test projections and updated capital\nplans will be due within 45 days of\ndistribution of the supervisory scenarios. It\nis unclear at this time how the Federal\nReserve expects to utilize the results of this\nadditional 2020 stress test or what, if any,\nimpact this additional round of stress testing\nmay have on the SCB or authorized capital\ndistributions of participating firms.

The most\nsignificant changes involve the election to\nexclude specific AOCI items from common equity\nTier 1 (CET1) capital and higher thresholds\nused to calculate CET1 capital deductions.\nEffective January 1, 2020, PNC must deduct\nfrom CET1 capital (net of associated deferred\ntax liabilities) investments in unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions, mortgage servicing\nrights and deferred tax assets to the extent\nsuch items individually exceed 25% of the\ninstitution\u2019s adjusted CET1 capital. PNC\u2019s\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2020\nare calculated using the standardized approach\nfor determining risk-weighted assets. Under\nthe standardized approach for determining\ncredit risk-weighted assets, exposures are\ngenerally assigned a pre-defined risk 38 The\nPNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\nweight. Exposures to high volatility\ncommercial real estate, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures. On March 27, 2020, the regulatory\nagencies issued an interim final rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date compared to the CECL ACL at\ntransition. The estimated CECL impact is added\nto CET1 capital through December 31, 2021,\nthen phased-out over the following three\nyears. PNC elected to adopt this optional\ntransition provision effective March 31, 2020.\nSee additional discussion of this interim\nfinal rule in the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section and Item 2 Risk\nManagement of our first quarter 2020 Form\n10-Q. In April 2020, in response to the\neconomic conditions caused by COVID-19, the\nFederal Reserve issued an interim final rule\nthat revises, on a temporary basis, the\ncalculation of supplementary leverage exposure\n(the denominator of the supplementary leverage\nratio) by bank holding companies to exclude\nthe on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks. The rule was effective as of April 14,\n2020 and will remain in effect through March\n31, 2021. See additional discussion of this\ninterim final rule in the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section of our first quarter 2020\nForm 10-Q. Federal banking regulators have\nstated that they expect the largest U.S. bank\nholding companies (BHCs), including PNC, to\nhave a level of regulatory capital well in\nexcess of the regulatory minimum and have\nrequired the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC,\nto have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our June 30, 2020\ncapital levels were aligned with them. At June\n30, 2020 , PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank\nsubsidiary, were both considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d based on applicable U.S.\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. To\nqualify as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, PNC must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6% for\nTier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for\nCommon equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8%\nfor Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at\nleast 5%. See the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section of our first quarter 2020\nForm 10-Q for recent developments that could\nhave a potential impact on our Basel III\ncapital ratios. We provide additional\ninformation regarding regulatory capital\nrequirements and some of their potential\nimpacts on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A\nRisk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in\nour 2019 Form 10-K. Market Risk Management See\nthe Market Risk Management portion of the Risk\nManagement Section in our 2019 Form 10-K for\nadditional discussion regarding market risk.\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans. Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities. Our Asset and\nLiability Management group centrally manages\ninterest rate risk as prescribed in our risk\nmanagement policies, which are approved by\nmanagement\u2019s Asset and Liability Committee and\nthe Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 39 Sensitivity results and market\ninterest rate benchmarks for the second\nquarter of 2020 and 2019 follow.

Table 33 :\nAlternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year\nForward The second quarter 2020 interest\nsensitivity analyses indicate that our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to\nbenefit from an increase in interest rates and\nan upward sloping interest rate yield curve.\nWe believe that we have the deposit funding\nbase and balance sheet flexibility to adjust,\nwhere appropriate and permissible, to changing\ninterest rates and market conditions. The\nplanned discontinuance of the requirement that\nbanks submit rates for the calculation of\nLIBOR after 2021 presents risks to the\nfinancial instruments originated, held, or\nserviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference\nrate. PNC holds instruments and services its\ninstruments and instruments owned by others\nthat may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC to financial,\nlegal, operational, and reputational risks.\nPNC has established a cross functional\ngovernance structure to oversee the overall\nstrategy for the transition from LIBOR and\nmitigate risks associated with the transition.\nAn initial LIBOR impact and risk assessment\nhas been performed, which identified the\nassociated risks across products, systems,\nmodels and processes.

These\ntransactions, related hedges and the credit\nvaluation adjustment related to our customer\nderivatives portfolio are marked-to-market\ndaily and reported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products. We use value-at-\nrisk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical correlations across different asset\nclasses. We calculate a diversified VaR at a\n95% confidence interval and the results for\nthe first six months of 2020 and 2019 were\nwithin our acceptable limits. See the Market\nRisk Management \u2013 Customer-Related Trading\nRisk section of our 2019 Form 10-K for more\ninformation on our models used to calculate\nVaR and our backtesting process. The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 41\nCustomer related trading revenue was $ 185\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2020\ncompared to $135 million for the same period\nin 2019 . For the quarterly period, customer\nrelated trading revenue was $114 million for\nthe second quarter of 2020 compared to $87\nmillion in 2019. The increase was primarily\ndue to higher derivative sales to clients\nmainly due to interest rate and oil price\nvolatility. Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity\nAnd Other Investment Risk Equity investment\nrisk is the risk of potential losses\nassociated with investing in both private and\npublic equity markets. In addition to\nextending credit, taking deposits,\nunderwriting securities and trading financial\ninstruments, we make and manage direct\ninvestments in a variety of transactions,\nincluding management buyouts,\nrecapitalizations and growth financings in a\nvariety of industries. We also have\ninvestments in affiliated and non-affiliated\nfunds that make similar investments in private\nequity. The economic and/or book value of\nthese investments and other assets are\ndirectly affected by changes in market\nfactors. Various PNC business units manage our\nequity and other investment activities.

These tax credit investment balances\nincluded unfunded commitments totaling $.8\nbillion and $1.0 billion at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. These\nunfunded commitments are included in Other\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2019\nForm 10-K has further information on Tax\nCredit Investments. Private Equity and Other\nThe majority of our other equity investments\nconsists of our private equity portfolio. The\nprivate equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $ 1.4\nbillion and $1.5 billion at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. As of June\n30, 2020 , $ 1.2 billion was invested directly\nin a variety of companies and $ .2 billion was\ninvested indirectly through various private\nequity funds. See the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of our 2019 Form\n10-K for discussion of the potential impacts\nof the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank\non our interests in and other relationships\nwith private funds covered by the Volcker\nRule. Included in our other equity investments\nare Visa Class B common shares, which are\nrecorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares\nthat we own are transferable only under\nlimited circumstances until they can be\nconverted into shares of the publicly-traded\nClass A common shares, which cannot happen\nuntil the resolution of the pending\ninterchange litigation. Based upon the June\n30, 2020 per share closing price of $193.17\nfor a Visa Class A common share, the estimated\nvalue of our total investment in the Class B\ncommon shares was approximately $ 1.1 billion\nat the current conversion rate of Visa B\nshares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis\nwas not significant. See Note 6 Fair Value and\nNote 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2019 10-K for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements. The estimated\nvalue does not represent fair value of the\nVisa B common shares given the share\u2019s limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace. We also have\ncertain other equity investments, the majority\nof which represent investments in affiliated\nand non-affiliated funds with both traditional\nand alternative investment strategies. Net\ngains related to these investments were not\nsignificant at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019\n. Financial Derivatives We use a variety of\nfinancial derivatives as part of the overall\nasset and liability risk management process to\nhelp manage exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risk inherent in our\nbusiness activities. We also enter into\nderivatives with customers to facilitate their\nrisk management activities. 42 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional and an underlying as\nspecified in the contract. Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments. Further information on our\nfinancial derivatives is presented in Note 1\nAccounting Policies, Note 6 Fair Value and\nNote 13 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2019\nForm 10-K and in Note 12 Fair Value and Note\n13 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this\nReport. Not all elements of market and credit\nrisk are addressed through the use of\nfinancial derivatives, and such instruments\nmay be ineffective for their intended purposes\ndue to unanticipated market changes, among\nother reasons. R ECENT R EGULATORY D\nEVELOPMENTS Since the outbreak of COVID-19,\nthe U.S. Government has taken a wide variety\nof actions in order to aid businesses and\nconsumers financially impacted by COVID-19,\nfacilitate the orderly functioning of\nfinancial markets and assist banking\norganizations in being able to meet the credit\nand other banking needs of their customers and\ncommunities. The following provides an\noverview of the most significant recent COVID-\nrelated actions affecting U.S. banking\norganizations, such as PNC. See Item 2 Recent\nRegulatory Developments and Item 1A Risk\nFactors in our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q\nfor a description of the risks presented by\nCOVID-19. CARES Act Related Developments In\nJuly 2020, President Trump signed an extension\nof the PPP, which provides forgivable loans to\nsmall and medium-sized businesses affected by\nthe pandemic. The extension authorizes the SBA\nto continue to accept PPP loan applications\nuntil August 8, 2020. PNC Bank continues to\nparticipate in the PPP with our focus shifting\nto the loan forgiveness process. Capital,\nCapital Planning and Liquidity In June 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve announced the results of\nits stress tests for 2020 and additional\nsensitivity analyses that the agency conducted\nin light of COVID-19. See the Liquidity and\nCapital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section in this Item 2 for a\ndiscussion of PNC\u2019s results and capital\nactions. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve\nannounced that it will, among other actions,\nrequire banks like PNC to suspend share\nrepurchases (except those to offset the\neffects of employee benefit plan-related\nissuances), resubmit their capital plans, and\nconduct additional stress analyses later this\nyear as economic conditions evolve. These\ncapital distribution limitations will apply\nfor the third quarter of 2020, and may be\nextended by the Federal Reserve. In May 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued an\ninterim final rule that modifies the agencies\u2019\nLCR rule to support banking organizations\u2019\nparticipation in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Money\nMarket Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF)\nand the PPP Liquidity Facility (PPPLF). The\ninterim final rule neutralizes the LCR impact\nassociated with the non-recourse funding\nprovided by these facilities. Separately, in\nJune 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule to\nmitigate the deposit insurance assessment\neffects of participating in the PPP, the\nPPPLF, and the MMLF. Among other changes, the\nfinal rule removes the effect of participation\nin the PPP and borrowings under the PPPLF on\nvarious risk measures used to calculate the\nassessment rate of an insured depository\ninstitution like PNC Bank, and provides an\noffset to an insured depository institution\u2019s\nassessment for the increase to its assessment\nbase attributable to participation in the PPP\nand MMLF. The final rule will be applied to\nassessments starting in the second quarter of\n2020. Similarly, in June 2020, the OCC issued\nan interim final rule that will reduce\nassessments due to be paid to the OCC on\nSeptember 30, 2020. Under the interim final\nrule, assessments due will be calculated using\nthe lower of the bank\u2019s assets on December 31,\n2019 or June 30, 2020. In May 2020, the\nFederal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC issued an\ninterim final rule that permits depository\ninstitutions like PNC Bank to elect to\nexclude, until March 31, 2021, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from its supplementary leverage exposure\nfor purposes of calculating the institution\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR). If a\ndepository institution elects to exclude these\nitems from its SLR calculation, it must obtain\nthe approval of its primary federal banking\nregulator before making capital distributions\nas long as the exclusion is in effect. In\nlight of PNC Bank\u2019s strong SLR, PNC Bank has\nnot elected to take advantage of this interim\nfinal rule. In May 2020, the Federal Reserve\nand FDIC extended, until September 29, 2021,\nthe submission date for the next resolution\nplans for Category II and Category III\norganizations, such as PNC, under section\n165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. In April 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve announced temporary\nactions aimed at increasing the availability\nof intraday credit extended by Federal Reserve\nBanks on both a collateralized and\nuncollateralized basis. Among other actions,\nthe Federal Reserve suspended uncollateralized\nintraday credit limits (net debit caps),\nwaived overdraft fees for institutions that\nare eligible for the primary credit program,\nand suspended two collections of information\nthat are used to calculate net debit caps.\nThese temporary actions are currently\nscheduled to remain in effect until September\n30, 2020. The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 43 In April 2020, the Federal\nReserve also amended Regulation D (reserve\nrequirements for depository institutions) to\neliminate the regulatory six-per-month limit\non certain types of transfers from the savings\ndeposits, which may result in certain changes\nto how depository institutions (such as PNC\nBank) classify and report deposit balances.\nOther Developments The regulatory agencies\nalso recently finalized a number of non-\nCOVID-19-related rules. For example, in July\n2020, the CFPB issued a final rule rescinding\nthe mandatory underwriting provisions of its\n2017 payday lending rule that required lenders\nto make certain underwriting determinations\nprior to issuing payday and other covered\nloans, but leaving intact the payments\nprovisions of the 2017 rule. In connection\nwith issuing this final rule, the CFPB also\nissued a statement indicating that it did not\nintend to take supervisory or enforcement\naction to enforce the application of the final\nrule to loans with an original principal\nbalance that exceeds $58,300. In June 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, SEC, and the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)\nfinalized a rule modifying the Volcker rule\u2019s\nprohibition on banking entities investing in\nor sponsoring hedge funds or private equity\nfunds (referred to under the rule as covered\nfunds). The final rule streamlines several\naspects of the covered funds portion of the\nrule; allows banking organizations to offer\nand sponsor venture capital funds and a wider\narray of loan-related funds; and permits\nbanking entities to offer financial services\nto, and engage in other activities with,\ncovered funds that do not raise concerns that\nthe Volcker rule was intended to address. The\nfinal rule will be effective October 1, 2020.\nIn June 2020, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC,\nFarm Credit Administration, and the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency finalized amendments to\nthe swap margin rule. Under the final rule,\nentities that are part of the same banking\norganization-like PNC Bank and its affiliates-\ngenerally will no longer be required to hold a\nspecific amount of initial margin for\nuncleared swaps with each other (known as\ninter-affiliate swaps), unless the aggregate\ninitial margin calculation amount for such\nswaps exceeds 15 percent of the covered swap\nentity\u2019s tier 1 capital. Additionally, among\nother changes, the final rule allows swap\nentities to amend legacy swaps to replace\nreferences to the London Inter-bank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) or other reference rates that are\nexpected to be discontinued without triggering\nmargin exchange requirements. Separately, the\nagencies issued an interim final rule that\nextends the compliance date under the swap\nmargin rule for entities like PNC to September\n1, 2021. In June 2020, the OCC released a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to update\nits rules for national bank and federal\nsavings association activities and operations.\nAmong other significant changes, the NPR would\nincorporate and streamline interpretations\naddressing permissible derivatives activities\nand codify interpretations that permit\nnational banks to engage in certain tax equity\nfinance transactions and participate in\npayment systems. Separately, the OCC also\nreleased an advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking (ANPR) seeking public comment on\nhow the OCC\u2019s rules could be modified to\nbetter facilitate the provision of banking\nproducts and services through digital means.\nComments for the NPR and ANPR are due on\nAugust 3, 2020. With respect to consumer\nfinancial protection matters, in June 2020,\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n(CFPB) issued an interim final rule amending\nits Regulation X to facilitate the offering of\nCOVID-19 related loss mitigation options to\nmortgage borrowers. The amendments temporarily\npermit mortgage servicers like PNC Bank to\noffer certain loss mitigation options without\nobtaining a complete loss mitigation\napplication. Mortgage servicers may offer such\nloss mitigation options to borrowers\nparticipating in COVID-related payment\nforbearance programs or experiencing financial\nhardships due to COVID-19. In June 2020, the\nU.S. Supreme Court held that the Dodd-Frank\nAct provision that allows the President to\nremove the CFPB\u2019s single director only for\ninefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance violates\nthe separation of powers in the U.S.\nConstitution, but otherwise left the structure\nand powers of the CFPB intact. In response,\nthe CFPB in July 2020 issued a ratification\nthrough its now removable-at-will director of\nthe large majority of its existing regulations\nand certain other regulatory actions taken\nfrom January 4, 2012 through June 30, 2020. In\nMay 2020, the CFPB issued a final rule\ncovering remittance transfers, which allows\ncertain banks and credit unions to continue to\nprovide estimates of the exchange rate and\ncertain remittance fees under certain\nconditions. In May 2020, the OCC finalized\namendments to its regulations implementing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA), which\nrequires the agencies to assess a bank\u2019s\nrecord of meeting the credit needs of its\nentire community, including low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods. The final rule\nsignificantly revamps for national banks like\nPNC Bank how the OCC defines what qualifies\nfor CRA credit, where such activity must be\nconducted to receive credit, how CRA\nperformance is measured, and how CRA\nperformance is documented and reported. The\nfinal rule is effective October 1, 2020, with\na compliance date of January 1, 2023, for PNC\nBank. The OCC has indicated it will conduct a\nfuture rulemaking to set the quantitative\nlevels of CRA activity that a national bank\nwould have to achieve to receive a\nSatisfactory or Outstanding CRA rating, either\nwithin a particular assessment area or\noverall. In May 2020, the OCC finalized a rule\nto address the legal uncertainty regarding the\neffect of a transfer on a loan\u2019s permissible\ninterest rate caused by the Second Circuit\u2019s\n2015 decision in Madden v. Midland Funding,\nLLC. The rule clarifies that when a national\nbank like PNC Bank sells, assigns, or\notherwise transfers a loan, interest\npermissible before the transfer continues to\nbe permissible after the transfer. In June\n2020, the FDIC issued a final regulation for\nstate banks that mirrors the OCC\u2019s rule. 44\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q C RITICAL A CCOUNTING E STIMATES AND J\nUDGMENTS Note 1 Accounting Policies of our\n2019 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use to prepare our\nconsolidated financial statements, including\ndiscussion of our policies for the Allowances\nfor Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan\nCommitments and Letters of Credit, prior to\nthe adoption of the CECL standard. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this\nReport regarding the impact of new accounting\npronouncements, including CECL, that were\nadopted in the first and second quarters of\n2020. Certain policies require us to make\nestimates or economic assumptions that may\nvary under different assumptions or\nconditions, and such variations may\nsignificantly affect our reported results and\nfinancial position for the period or in future\nperiods. The following critical accounting\npolicies and judgments are described in more\ndetail in Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments in Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K:\n                              \n  \u2022  Fair Value Measurements  \n                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Residential and Commercial Mortgage      \n     Servicing Rights                         \n                                              \nAllowance for Credit Losses We maintain the\nACL at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our existing\ninvestment securities, loans, finance leases\n(including residual values), other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets taking into consideration\nexpected prepayments. Our determination of the\nACL is based on historical loss experience,\nborrower characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We use methods sensitive to\nchanges in economic conditions, to interpret\nthese factors to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate ACL on an\nongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to\nreflect in the ACL our best estimate of\namounts that we do not expect to collect\nbecause of, among other things, idiosyncratic\nrisk factors, changes in economic conditions\nthat may not be reflected in forecasted\nresults, or other potential methodology\nweaknesses. The ACL estimates are therefore\nsusceptible to various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, the following major factors: \u2022\nCurrent economic conditions and borrower\nquality: Our forecast of expected losses\ndepends on conditions and portfolio quality as\nof the estimation date. As current conditions\nevolve, forecasted losses could be materially\naffected.\n                                              \n     Scenario weights and design: Our loss    \n  \u2022  estimates are sensitive to the shape     \n     and severity of macroeconomic forecasts  \n     and thus                                 \n                                              \nvary significantly between upside and downside\nscenarios. Change to probability weights\nassigned to these scenarios and timing of peak\nbusiness cycles reflected by the scenarios\ncould materially affect our loss estimates.\n                                              \n     Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to     \n  \u2022  portfolio volume and mix could           \n     materially affect our estimates, as      \n     CECL reserves                            \n                                              \nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition. For all assets and unfunded\nlending related commitments within the scope\nof the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is\ncomposed of one or a combination of the\nfollowing components: (i) collectively\nassessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually\nassessed reserves, and (iii) qualitative\n(judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and\nkey assumptions for each of these components\nare discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nof this Report. Reasonable and Supportable\nEconomic Forecast Under CECL, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework which includes a three year\nreasonable and supportable economic forecast\nperiod and the use of four economic scenarios\nwith associated probability weights, which in\ncombination create a forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes over our reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period (RSFP). Our RSFP\ncredit loss estimates are sensitive to the\nshape and severity of the scenarios used and\nweights assigned to them. To generate the four\neconomic forecast scenarios we use a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic\nmodels, other measures of economic activity\nand forward-looking expert judgment to\nforecast the distribution of economic outcomes\nover the RSFP. Each scenario is then given an\nassociated probability (weight) in order to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the RSFP. This process is\ninformed by current economic conditions,\nexpected business cycle evolution and the\nexpert judgment of PNC\u2019s CECL Reserve Adequacy\nCommittee (CECL RAC). This approach seeks to\nprovide a reasonable representation of the\nforecast of expected economic outcomes and is\nused to estimate expected credit losses across\na variety of loans and securities. Each\nquarter the scenarios are presented for\napproval to PNC\u2019s CECL RAC and the committee\ndetermines and approves CECL scenarios weights\nfor use for the current reporting period. The\nscenarios used for the period ended June 30,\n2020 were designed to address the impact of\nthe continuing COVID-19 crisis on the\nmacroeconomic environment, based on our best\nestimate as of June 30, 2020. We used a number\nof economic variables, with the largest\ndrivers being GDP and the unemployment rate\nmeasures. Using a weighted average of our four\neconomic forecast scenarios, we estimated at\nJune 30, 2020 that annualized GDP contracts\n6.2% in the third quarter of 2020, finishing\nthe year down 4.9% from The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 45 fourth\nquarter 2019 levels and recovering to pre-\nrecession peak levels by the first quarter of\n2022. Additionally, the quarterly unemployment\nrate falls to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of\n2020, from a peak of 13.6% in the second\nquarter, with the labor market continuing to\nrecover in 2021 and 2022. We believe that the\neconomic assumptions used in the scenarios for\nthe second quarter of 2020 sufficiently\nreflect the life of loan losses in the current\nportfolio, and based on these assumptions we\ndo not anticipate any substantial reserve\nbuilds related to our current portfolio during\nthe remainder of 2020. For internal analytical\npurposes, we considered what our capital\nratios would be if we had an ACL at December\n31, 2020 equal to the Federal Reserve's\nestimated nine quarter credit losses for PNC\nunder the 2020 CCAR supervisory severely\nadverse scenario of $12.1 billion, essentially\nadding $5.5 billion in reserves over the next\ntwo quarters. This analysis resulted in a CET1\nratio of approximately 10.0% at December 31,\n2020, a level well above 7.0%, which is our\nregulatory minimum of 4.5% plus our Stress\nCapital Buffer of 2.5%. This scenario was not\nour expectation at June 30, 2020 and does not\nreflect our current expectation, nor does it\ncapture all the potential unknown variables\nthat would likely arise through the remainder\nof 2020, but it provides an approximation of a\npossible outcome under hypothetical severe\nconditions. The CECL methodology inherently\nrequires a high degree of judgment. As a\nresult, it is possible that we may, at another\npoint in time, reach different conclusions\nregarding our credit loss estimates. See the\nfollowing for additional details on the\ncomponents of our ACL, as well as the\nmethodologies and related assumptions:\n                                              \n     Allowance For Credit Losses in the       \n  \u2022  Credit Risk Management section of this   \n     Financial Review, and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Note1Accounting Policies,                \n     Note3Investment Securitiesand            \n  \u2022  Note4Loans and Related Allowance for     \n     Credit Lossesin the Notes To             \n     Consolidated Financial Statements        \n     included in this Report.                 \n                                              \nO FF -B ALANCE S HEET A RRANGEMENTS A ND V\nARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES We engage in a\nvariety of activities that involve entities\nthat are not consolidated or otherwise\nreflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet\nthat are generally referred to as off-balance\nsheet arrangements.

These statements are      \n     based on our view that:                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     PNC\u2019s baseline economic forecast is for  \n     an economic recovery in the second half  \n     of 2020 and into 2021, following a very  \n     severe but short recession in the first  \n     half of 2020. Consumers are increasing   \n     their spending and workers are           \n     returning to their job sites as states   \n     are gradually lifting restrictions on    \n  \u2013  businesses and activities because of     \n     the COVID-19 pandemic; fiscal stimulus   \n     from the federal government is also      \n     supporting economic growth in mid-2020.  \n     After a significant contraction in real  \n     GDP, steep job losses, and a large       \n     increase in the unemployment rate        \n     earlier in the second quarter, economic  \n     growth has resumed and the labor market  \n     is improving.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     In the baseline forecast, real GDP       \n     increases in the third quarter as        \n     consumers start to spend again. Fiscal   \n  \u2013  stimulus and extremely low interest      \n     rates support the recovery. Real GDP     \n     surpasses its pre-recession peak in      \n     2022, and growth is well above its       \n     long-term trend through 2023.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     The baseline forecast assumes that the   \n  \u2013  Federal Open Market Committee keeps the  \n     federal funds rate in its current range  \n     of 0.00% to 0.25% into 2023.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Given the many unknowns and potential    \n     downside risks, including additional     \n     COVID-19 outbreaks, our forward-looking  \n     statements are subject to the risk that  \n     conditions will be substantially         \n     different than we are currently          \n     expecting. If efforts to contain         \n     COVID-19 are unsuccessful and            \n     restrictions on businesses and           \n     activities are reimposed or expanded,    \n     the economy could fall back into         \n     recession. The potential expiration of   \n     fiscal stimulus is also a major          \n     downside risk. The longer the labor      \n     market recovery takes, the more it will  \n     damage consumer fundamentals and         \n  \u2022  sentiment. This could make the recovery  \n     weaker. Similarly, weak near-term        \n     growth could damage business             \n     fundamentals. And an extended global     \n     recession due to COVID-19 would weaken   \n     the U.S. recovery. As a result, the      \n     outbreak and its consequences,           \n     including responsive measures to manage  \n     it, have had and are likely to continue  \n     to have an adverse effect, possibly      \n     materially, on our business and          \n     financial performance by adversely       \n     affecting, possibly materially, the      \n     demand and profitability of our          \n     products and services, the valuation of  \n     assets and our ability to meet the       \n     needs of our customers.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital    \n     actions, including returning capital to  \n     shareholders beginning in the fourth     \n     quarter of 2020, is subject to PNC       \n     meeting or exceeding a stress capital    \n     buffer established by the Federal        \n     Reserve Board in connection with the     \n  \u2022  Federal Reserve Board's Comprehensive    \n     Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)       \n     process.

The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 53 NOTES TO\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS T HE PNC F\nINANCIAL S ERVICES G ROUP , I NC . Unaudited B\nUSINESS The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n(PNC) is one of the largest diversified\nfinancial services companies in the United\nStates (U.S.) and is headquartered in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We have businesses\nengaged in retail banking, including\nresidential mortgage, corporate and\ninstitutional banking and asset management,\nproviding many of our products and services\nnationally. Our retail branch network is\nlocated primarily in markets across the Mid-\nAtlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have\nstrategic international offices in four\ncountries outside the U.S. N OTE 1 A CCOUNTING\nP OLICIES Basis of Financial Statement\nPresentation Our consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of the parent\ncompany and its subsidiaries, most of which\nare wholly-owned, certain partnership\ninterests and variable interest entities. We\nprepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (GAAP). We have eliminated\nintercompany accounts and transactions. In our\nopinion, the unaudited interim consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all normal,\nrecurring adjustments needed to present fairly\nour results for the interim periods. The\nresults of operations for interim periods are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that\nmay be expected for the full year or any other\ninterim period. We have also considered the\nimpact of subsequent events on these\nconsolidated financial statements. When\npreparing these unaudited interim consolidated\nfinancial statements, we have assumed that you\nhave read the audited consolidated financial\nstatements included in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nThese interim consolidated financial\nstatements serve to update our 2019 Form 10-K\nand may not include all information and Notes\nnecessary to constitute a complete set of\nfinancial statements. There have been\nsignificant changes to our accounting policies\nas disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K due to the\nadoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses\n(CECL) standard and our discontinued operation\nas a result of the disposal of our equity\ninvestment in BlackRock. As a result of this\ndisposal, BlackRock\u2019s historical results of\noperations are reported as discontinued\noperations in our consolidated financial\nstatements for all periods presented. The\nupdated policies impacted by these changes are\nincluded in this Note 1. Reference is made to\nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2019 Form\n10-K for a detailed description of all other\nsignificant accounting policies. Use of\nEstimates We prepared these consolidated\nfinancial statements using financial\ninformation available at the time of\npreparation, which requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported. Our most significant\nestimates pertain to our fair value\nmeasurements and allowance for credit losses\n(ACL). Actual results may differ from the\nestimates and the differences may be material\nto the consolidated financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations A disposal of an asset\nor business that meets the criteria for held\nfor sale classification is reported as\ndiscontinued operations when the disposal\nrepresents a strategic shift that has had, or\nwill have, a major effect on our operating\nresults. We report an asset as held for sale\nwhen management has approved or received\napproval to sell the asset and is committed to\na formal plan, the asset is available for\nimmediate sale, the asset is being actively\nmarketed, the sale is anticipated to occur\nduring the ensuing year and certain other\nspecified criteria are met. An asset\nclassified as held for sale is recorded at the\nlower of its carrying amount or estimated fair\nvalue less cost to sell. If the carrying\namount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair\nvalue, the asset is written down to its fair\nvalue upon the held for sale designation. Our\nBlackRock held for sale asset is recorded at\nits carrying amount as we accounted for this\ninvestment under the equity method of\naccounting and the fair value of the asset\nexceeded the carrying value at each balance\nsheet date. When presenting discontinued\noperations, assets classified as held for sale\nare segregated in the Consolidated Balance\nSheet commencing in the period in which the\nasset meets all of the held for sale criteria\ndescribed above and prior periods are recast.\nThe results of discontinued operations are\nreported in Discontinued Operations in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income for current\nand 54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\u2013 Form 10-Q prior periods commencing in the\nperiod in which the asset or business is\neither disposed of or is classified as held\nfor sale, including any gain or loss\nrecognized on sale or adjustment of the\ncarrying amount to fair value less cost to\nsell. Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings\nper common share is calculated using the two-\nclass method to determine income attributable\nto common shareholders. Unvested share-based\npayment awards that contain nonforfeitable\nrights to dividends or dividend equivalents\nare considered participating securities under\nthe two-class method. Distributed dividends\nand dividend equivalents related to\nparticipating securities and an allocation of\nundistributed net income to participating\nsecurities reduce the amount of income\nattributable to common shareholders. In a\nperiod with a loss, no allocation will be made\nto the participating securities, as they do\nnot have a contractual obligation to absorb\nlosses. Income attributable to common\nshareholders is then divided by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted earnings per common share is\ncalculated under the more dilutive of either\nthe treasury method or the two-class method.\nFor the diluted calculation, we increase the\nweighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding by the assumed conversion of\noutstanding convertible preferred stock from\nthe beginning of the year or date of issuance,\nif later, and the number of shares of common\nstock that would be issued assuming the\nexercise of stock options and warrants and the\nissuance of incentive shares using the\ntreasury stock method. These adjustments to\nthe weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding are made only when\nsuch adjustments will dilute earnings per\ncommon share. For periods in which there is a\nloss from continuing operations, any potential\ndilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this\nscenario, no potential dilutive shares will be\nincluded in the continuing operations,\ndiscontinued operations or total earnings per\ncommon share calculations, even if overall net\nincome is reported.See Note 11 Earnings Per\nShare for additional information.

represent a primary\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nInvestments                                   \n                                              \nWe hold interests in various types of         \ninvestments. The accounting for these         \ninvestments is dependent on a number of       \nfactors including,                            \n                                              \nbut not limited to, items such as:            \n                                              \n\u2022 Ownership interest,                         \n                                              \n\u2022 Our plans for the investment, and           \n                                              \n\u2022 The nature of the investment.               \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 57 Debt Securities Debt securities are\nrecorded on a trade-date basis. We classify\ndebt securities as either trading, held to\nmaturity, or available for sale. Debt\nsecurities that we purchase for certain risk\nmanagement activities or customer-related\ntrading activities are classified as trading\nsecurities, are reported in the Other assets\nline item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet,\nand are carried at fair value. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses on trading\nsecurities are included in Other noninterest\nincome. We classify debt securities as held to\nmaturity when we have the positive intent and\nability to hold the securities to maturity,\nand carry them at amortized cost, less any\nallowance. Debt securities not classified as\nheld to maturity or trading are classified as\nsecurities available for sale, and are carried\nat fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale securities are included in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\nnet of income taxes. We include all interest\non debt securities, including amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts on\ninvestment securities, in net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method\ngenerally calculated over the contractual\nlives of the securities. Effective yields\nreflect either the effective interest rate\nimplicit in the security at the date of\nacquisition or, for debt securities where an\nother-than-temporary impairment was recorded,\nthe effective interest rate determined based\non improved cash flows subsequent to an\nimpairment. We compute gains and losses\nrealized on the sale of available for sale\ndebt securities on a specific security basis.\nThese securities gains/(losses) are included\nin Other noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement. As discussed in\nthe Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nsection of this Note 1 , we adopted the CECL\nstandard as of January 1, 2020, which requires\nexpected credit losses on both held to\nmaturity and available for sale securities to\nbe recognized through a valuation allowance,\nACL, instead of as a direct write-down to the\namortized cost basis of the security. An\navailable for sale security is considered\nimpaired if the fair value is less than\namortized cost basis. If any portion of the\ndecline in fair value is related to credit,\nthe amount of allowance is determined as the\nportion related to credit, limited to the\ndifference between the amortized cost basis\nand the fair value of the security. If we have\nthe intent to sell or believe it is more\nlikely than not we will be required to sell an\nimpaired available for sale security before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis, the\ncredit loss is recorded as a direct write-down\nof the amortized cost basis. Credit losses on\ninvestment securities are recognized through\nthe Provision for credit losses on our\nConsolidated Income Statement. Declines in the\nfair value of available for sale securities\nthat are not considered credit related are\nrecognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The CECL standard is applied\nprospectively to debt securities and, as a\nresult, the amortized cost basis of investment\nsecurities for which OTTI had previously been\nrecorded did not change upon adoption. For\ninformation on the policies previously applied\nto determine OTTI, see the Debt Securities\nsection of Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2019 Form 10-K. We consider a security to be\npast due in terms of payment based on its\ncontractual terms. A security may be placed on\nnonaccrual, with interest no longer recognized\nuntil received, when collectability of\nprincipal or interest is doubtful. As of June\n30, 2020 , nonaccrual or past due held-to-\nmaturity securities were immaterial. A\nsecurity may be partially or fully charged off\nagainst the allowance if it is determined to\nbe uncollectible, including, for an available\nfor sale security, if we have the intent to\nsell or believe it is more likely than not we\nwill be required to sell the security before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nRecoveries of previously charged-off available\nfor sale securities are recognized when\nreceived, while recoveries on held to maturity\nsecurities are recognized when expected. See\nthe Allowance for Credit Loss section of this\nNote 1 for further discussion regarding the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities. See Note 3\nInvestment Securities for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio and the related ACL. Loans Loans are\nclassified as held for investment when\nmanagement has both the intent and ability to\nhold the loan for the foreseeable future, or\nuntil maturity or payoff. Management\u2019s intent\nand view of the foreseeable future may change\nbased on changes in business strategies, the\neconomic environment, market conditions and\nthe availability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. See Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information on how COVID-19\nhardship related loan modifications are\nreported from a delinquency perspective as of\nJune 30, 2020. Loans held for investment,\nexcluding PCD loans, are recorded at amortized\ncost basis unless we elect to measure these\nunder the fair value option. Amortized cost\nbasis represents principal amounts\noutstanding, net of unearned income,\nunamortized deferred fees, costs on originated\nloans, and premiums or discounts on purchased\nloans, and charge-offs. Amortized cost basis\ndoes not include accrued interest, as we\ninclude accrued interest in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest on\nperforming loans is accrued based on the\nprincipal amount outstanding and recorded in\nInterest income as earned using the constant\neffective yield method. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net 58 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\ninterest income using the constant effective  \nyield method, over the contractual life of the\nloan. The processing fee received for loans   \noriginated under the Paycheck Protection      \nProgram (PPP) is deferred and accreted into   \nNet interest income using the effective yield \nmethod, over the contractual life of the loan.\nLoans under the fair value option are reported\nat their fair value, with any changes to fair \nvalue reported as Noninterest income on the   \nConsolidated Income Statement, and are        \nexcluded from measurement of ALLL.            \n                                              \nIn addition to originating loans, we also     \nacquire loans through the secondary loan      \nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother                                         \n                                              \nfinancial services companies. Certain acquired\nloans that have experienced a more than       \nsignificant deterioration of credit quality   \nsince origination (i.e., PCD) are recognized  \nat an amortized cost basis equal to their     \npurchase price plus an ALLL measured at the   \nacquisition date. Subsequent decreases in     \nexpected cash flows that are attributable, at \nleast in part, to credit quality are          \nrecognized through a charge to the provision  \nfor credit losses resulting in an increase in \nthe ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected    \ncash flows are recognized as a provision      \nrecapture of previously recorded ALLL.        \n                                              \nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent \nwhen we determine that substantially all of   \nthe expected cash flows will be generated     \n                                              \nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral  \nunderlying the loan, the borrower is          \nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have \nelected to                                    \n                                              \nmeasure the loan at the estimated fair value  \nof collateral (less costs to sell if sale or  \nforeclosure of the property is expected).     \n                                              \nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be        \ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or      \nliquidation of the underlying collateral is   \nprobable.                                     \n                                              \nA troubled debt restructuring (TDR) is a loan \nwhose terms have been restructured in a manner\nthat grants a concession to a borrower        \nexperiencing financial difficulty. A          \nconcession has been granted when we do not    \nexpect to collect all amounts due, including  \noriginal interest accrued at the original     \ncontract rate, as a result of the             \nrestructuring, or there is a delay in payment \nthat is more than insignificant. TDRs result  \nfrom our loss mitigation activities, and      \ninclude rate reductions, principal            \nforgiveness, postponement/reduction of        \nscheduled amortization, and extensions, which \nare intended to minimize economic loss and to \navoid foreclosure or repossession of          \ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result    \nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from \npersonal liability through Chapter 7          \nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed   \ntheir loan obligations to us. In those        \nsituations where principal is forgiven, the   \namount of such principal forgiveness is       \nimmediately charged off.                      \n                                              \nPotential incremental losses or recoveries on \nTDRs have been factored into the ALLL         \nestimates for each loan class under the       \nmethodologies described in this Note. Once a  \nloan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be    \nreported as a TDR until it is ultimately      \nrepaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed  \nupon, or it is fully charged off.             \nPNC excludes consumer loans held for sale,\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption and certain government insured or\nguaranteed loans from our TDR population. PCD\nloans that do not meet the criteria to be\nclassified as TDRs are also excluded. In\naddition, PNC has elected not to apply a TDR\ndesignation to loans that have been\nrestructured due to a COVID-19 hardship\npursuant to specific criteria under the CARES\nAct. Since loans restructured due to a\nCOVID-19 related hardship were not identified\nas TDRs, they are not placed on nonaccrual at\nthe time of modification. However, these loans\nwill be subject to our existing nonaccrual\npolicy subsequent to the modification.\nSee the following for additional information  \nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and \nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL,\nand additional details on the composition of  \nour loan portfolio:                           \n                                              \n  \u2022  Nonperforming Loans and Leases section   \n     of this Note 1,                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Allowance for Credit Losses section of   \n     this Note1, and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Note4Loans and Related Allowance for     \n     Credit Losses.                           \n                                              \nLoans Held for Sale                           \n                                              \nWe designate loans as held for sale when we   \nhave the intent to sell them.

Certain small business credit\ncard balances that are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus when they become 90 days or more past\ndue are charged-off at 180 days past due.\nConsumer We generally charge off secured\nconsumer (home equity, residential real estate\nand automobile) nonperforming loans to the\nfair value of collateral less costs to sell,\nif lower than the amortized cost basis of the\nloan outstanding, when delinquency of the\nloan, combined with other risk factors (e.g.,\nbankruptcy, lien position, or troubled debt\nrestructuring), indicates that the loan, or\nsome portion thereof, is uncollectible as per\nour historical experience, or the collateral\nhas been repossessed. We charge-off secured\nconsumer loans no later than 180 days past\ndue. Most consumer loans and lines of credit,\nnot secured by residential real estate, are\ncharged off once they have reached 120-180\ndays past due. For secured collateral\ndependent loans, collateral values are updated\nat least annually and subsequent declines in\ncollateral values are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected.\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans For nonaccrual\nloans, interest income accrual and deferred\nfee/cost recognition is discontinued.\nAdditionally, the current year accrued and\nuncollected interest is reversed through Net\ninterest income and prior year accrued and\nuncollected interest is charged-off, except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged-off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell. If payment is\nreceived on a nonaccrual loan, generally the\npayment is first applied to the remaining\nprincipal balance; payments are then applied\nto recover any charged-off amounts related to\nthe loan. Finally, if both principal balance\nand any charge-offs have been recovered, then\nthe payment will be recorded as fee and\ninterest income. For certain consumer loans,\nthe receipt of interest payments is recognized\nas interest income on a cash basis. Cash basis\nincome recognition is applied if a loan\u2019s\namortized cost basis is deemed fully\ncollectible and the loan has performed for at\nleast six months. For TDRs, payments are\napplied based upon their contractual terms\nunless the related loan is deemed non-\nperforming. TDRs are generally included in\nnonperforming and nonaccrual loans. However,\nafter a reasonable period of time, generally\nsix months, in which the loan performs under\nrestructured terms and meets other performance\nindicators, it is returned to\nperforming/accruing status. This return to\nperforming/accruing status demonstrates that\nthe bank expects to collect all of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nTDRs resulting from (i) borrowers that have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus, and (ii) borrowers that are not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Other nonaccrual\nloans are generally not returned to accrual\nstatus until the borrower has performed in\naccordance with the contractual terms and\nother performance indicators for at least six\nmonths, the period of time which was\ndetermined to demonstrate the expected\ncollection of the loan\u2019s remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest. Nonaccrual loans with\npartially charged-off principal are not\nreturned to accrual. When a nonperforming loan\nis returned to accrual status, it is then\nconsidered a performing loan. Foreclosed\nassets consist of any asset seized or property\nacquired through a foreclosure proceeding or\nacceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nOther real estate owned (OREO) comprises\nprincipally commercial and residential real\nestate properties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense. For certain\nmortgage loans that have a government\nguarantee, we establish a separate other\nreceivable upon foreclosure. The receivable is\nmeasured based on the loan balance (inclusive\nof principal and interest) that is expected to\nbe recovered from the guarantor.

The\nPNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n61 Allowance for Credit Losses Our ACL, in\naccordance with the CECL standard, is based on\nhistorical loss experience, borrower risk\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, finance leases (including\nresidual values), other financial assets and\nunfunded lending related commitments, for the\nestimated contractual term of the assets or\nexposures as of the balance sheet date. We\nestimate the estimated contractual term of\nassets in scope of CECL considering\ncontractual maturity dates, prepayment\nexpectations, utilization or draw expectations\nand any embedded extension options that do not\nallow us to unilaterally cancel the extension\noptions. For products without a fixed\ncontractual maturity date ( e.g ., credit\ncards), we rely on historical payment behavior\nto determine the length of the pay down or\ndefault time period. We estimate expected\nlosses on a pooled basis using a combination\nof (i) the expected losses over a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period (RSFP), (ii) a\nperiod of reversion to long run average (LRA)\nexpected losses (reversion period) where\napplicable, and (iii) the LRA expected losses\nfor the remaining estimated contractual term.\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable. We use\nforward-looking information in estimating\nexpected credit losses for the RSFP. For this\npurpose, we use the forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC's Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nqualitative techniques, analysis from PNC\neconomists and management judgment. The\nreversion period is used to bridge RSFP and\nLRA expected credit losses. We may consider a\nnumber of factors in determining the duration\nof the reversion period, such as contractual\nmaturity of the asset, observed historical\npatterns and the estimated credit loss rates\nat the end of RSFP relative to the beginning\nof the LRA period. The LRA expected credit\nlosses are derived from long run historical\ncredit loss information adjusted for the\ncredit quality of the current portfolio, and\ntherefore do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions. See the\nfollowing sections related to investment\nsecurities, loans, trade receivables, other\nfinancial assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments for details about specific\nmethodologies. Allowance for Investment\nSecurities A significant portion of our\ninvestment securities are issued or guaranteed\nby either the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury\nor Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA)) or a government-sponsored agency\n(Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)\nor Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(FHLMC)). Taking into consideration historical\ninformation and current and forecasted\nconditions, we do not expect to incur any\ncredit losses on these securities. Investment\nsecurities that are not issued or guaranteed\nby the U.S. government or a government-\nsponsored agency consist of both securitized\nproducts, such as non-agency mortgage and\nasset-backed securities, as well as non-\nsecuritized products, such as corporate and\nmunicipal debt securities. A discounted cash\nflow approach is primarily used to determine\nthe amount of the allowance required. The\nestimates of expected cash flows are\ndetermined using macroeconomic sensitive\nmodels taking into consideration the RSFP and\nscenarios discussed above. Additional factors\nunique to a specific security may also be\ntaken into consideration when estimating\nexpected cash flows. The cash flows expected\nto be collected, after considering expected\nprepayments, are discounted at the effective\ninterest rate. For an available-for-sale\nsecurity, the amount of the allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nestimated fair value. See Note 3 Investment\nSecurities in this Report for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as probability of default (PD), loss\ngiven default (LGD) and exposure at default\n(EAD) for a loan or loan segment. We also\nconsider the impact of prepayments and\namortization on contractual maturity in our\nexpected loss estimates. We use historical\ncredit loss information, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics and forecasted economic\nvariables for the RSFP, coupled with\nanalytical methods, to estimate these risk\nparameters by loan or loan segments. PD, LGD\nand EAD parameters are calculated for each\nforecasted scenario and the LRA period, and\ncombined to generate expected loss estimates\nby scenario. The following matrix provides key\ncredit risk characteristics that we use to\nestimate these risk parameters. 62 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n

Other than the estimation of the   \nprobability of funding, this reserve is       \nestimated in a manner similar to the          \nmethodology used for determining reserves for \nloans and leases. The allowance for unfunded  \nlending related commitments is recorded as a  \nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  \nNet adjustments to this reserve are included  \nin the provision for credit losses.           \n                                              \nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for    \nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.                               \n                                              \nAllowance for Other Financial Assets          \n                                              \nWe determine the allowance for other financial\nassets (e.g., trade receivables, servicing    \nadvances on PNC-owned loans, balances with    \nbanks) considering historical loss information\nand other available indicators. In certain    \ncases where there are no historical, current  \nor forecast indicators of an expected credit  \nloss, we may estimate the reserve to be close \nto zero. As of June 30, 2020 , the allowance  \nfor other financial assets was immaterial.    \nGoodwill                                      \nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions   \nrepresents the value attributable to          \nunidentifiable intangible elements in the     \nbusiness acquired. At least annually, in the  \nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events  \noccur or circumstances have changed           \nsignificantly from the annual test date,      \nmanagement performs our goodwill impairment   \ntest at a reporting unit level.               \nPNC has the ability to first perform a        \nqualitative analysis to evaluate whether it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a \nreporting unit is less than its carrying      \namount. If, after considering all relevant    \nevents and circumstances, PNC determines it is\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value  \nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying \namount, then performing a quantitative        \nimpairment test is not necessary. If PNC      \nelects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or \nconcludes via qualitative analysis that it is \nmore-likely-than-                             \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 65 not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test is\nperformed. Inputs are generated and used in\ncalculating the fair value of the reporting\nunit, which is compared to its carrying\namount. The fair value of our reporting units\nis determined by using discounted cash flows\nand/or market comparability methodologies. If\nthe fair value is greater than the carrying\namount, then the reporting unit's goodwill is\ndeemed not to be impaired. If the fair value\nis less than the carrying amount, an entity\nshould recognize an impairment charge for the\namount by which the carrying amount of\ngoodwill exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair\nvalue. The loss recognized should not exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit.

We\nmaintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. As of June 30, 2020 , the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 32million and\nrelated to non-agency commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities and other debt securities.\nThe provision for credit losses on investment\nsecurities totaled $ 30million for both the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2020 . In\nthe first quarter of 2020, upon the adoption\nof ASU 2019-04, we elected to transfer debt\nsecurities with an amortized cost of $\n16.2billion and a fair value of $ 16.5billion\nfrom held to maturity to the available for\nsale portfolio. During the second quarter of\n2020, pursuant to the guidance in ASU 2020-04,\nwe elected to transfer debt securities with an\namortized cost of $ 49million and a fair value\nof $ 48million from the held to maturity to\nthe available for sale portfolio. 66 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q See\nNote 1 Accounting Policies for additional\ninformation related to the adoption of the\nCECL standard, including the methodologies\nused to determine the allowance for investment\nsecurities, and the adoption of ASU 2019-04\nand ASU 2020-04.

As of June 30, 2020 , 84% of our \nsecurities held to maturity were rated AAA/AA.\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Shareholders\u2019 equity as\nAOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at June 30, 2020\nincluded $ 347million of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for June 30, 2019 was $\n2.0billion .\n\nTable 39 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities as of June 30, 2020\n. These securities are segregated between\ninvestments that had been in a continuous\nunrealized loss position for less than twelve\nmonths and twelve months or more, based on the\npoint in time that the fair value declined\nbelow the amortized cost basis.

The comparable\namounts at December 31, 2019 were $\n16.9billion and $ 68.0billion , respectively.\nAmounts pledged reflect the unpaid principal\nbalances. Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming\nassets include nonperforming loans and leases,\nOREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming\nloans are those loans accounted for at\namortized cost whose credit quality has\ndeteriorated to the extent that full\ncollection of contractual principal and\ninterest is not probable. Interest income is\nnot recognized on these loans. Loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option are reported\nas performing loans, however, when nonaccrual\ncriteria is met interest income is not\nrecognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.

To\nevaluate the level of credit risk, we assign\nan internal risk rating reflecting the\nborrower\u2019s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional\ncredit risk rating methodology provides\ngranularity in the risk monitoring process.\nThese ratings are reviewed and updated,\ngenerally at least once per year. For small\nbalance homogeneous pools of commercial and\nindustrial loans, mortgages and leases, we\napply scoring techniques to assist in\ndetermining the PD. Further, on a periodic\nbasis, we update our LGD estimates associated\nwith each rating grade based upon historical\ndata. The combination of the PD and LGD\nratings assigned to commercial and industrial\nloans, capturing both the combination of\nexpectations of default and loss severity in\nevent of default, reflects credit quality\ncharacteristics as of the reporting date and\nare used as inputs into our loss forecasting\nprocess.\n\nBased upon the amount of the lending\narrangement and our risk rating assessment, we\nfollow a formal schedule of written periodic\nreview. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews\nof a market\u2019s or business unit\u2019s loan\nportfolio, focusing on those loans which we\nperceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs\nand LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is\nweakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our\npractice to review any customer obligation and\nits level of credit risk more frequently. We\nattempt to proactively manage our loans by\nusing various procedures that are customized\nto the risk of a given loan, including ongoing\noutreach, contact, and assessment of obligor\nfinancial conditions, collateral inspection\nand appraisal.\n\n72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q Commercial Real Estate We manage\ncredit risk associated with our commercial\nreal estate projects and commercial mortgages\nsimilar to commercial and industrial loans by\nevaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with\ncommercial real estate projects and commercial\nmortgage activities tend to be correlated to\nthe loan structure and collateral location,\nproject progress and business environment. As\na result, these attributes are also monitored\nand utilized in assessing credit risk. As with\nthe commercial and industrial loan class, a\nformal schedule of periodic review is also\nperformed to assess market/geographic risk and\nbusiness unit/industry risk. Often as a result\nof these overviews, more in-depth reviews and\nincreased scrutiny are placed on areas of\nhigher risk, such as adverse changes in risk\nratings, deteriorating operating trends,\nand/or areas that concern management. These\nreviews are designed to assess risk and\nfacilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\nEquipment Lease Financing We manage credit\nrisk associated with our equipment lease\nfinancing loan class similar to commercial and\nindustrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and\nthe level of credit risk, we follow a formal\nschedule of periodic review. Generally, this\noccurs quarterly, although we have established\npractices to review such credit risk more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant. Our\nreview process entails analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual\nvalue, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk,\nindustry risk, guarantor requirements, and\nregulatory compliance as applicable.\nTable 46 : Commercial Credit Quality\nIndicators (a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Dece\u2026                                       \n  31,                                         \n  2019                                        \n  - In         Pass                    Total  \n  mill\u2026       Rated       Criti\u2026       Loans  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and      $  119,\u2026    $   5,576    $  125,\u2026  \n  indu\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  real        27,4\u2026          686       28,1\u2026  \n  esta\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  lease       6,891          264       7,155  \n  fina\u2026                                       \n  Total    $  154,\u2026    $   6,526    $  160,\u2026  \n  comm\u2026                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Loans in our commercial portfolio are  \n       classified as Pass Rated or            \n       Criticized based on the regulatory     \n       definitions, which are driven by the   \n       PD and LGD ratings that we assign.     \n       The Criticized classification          \n       includes loans that were rated         \n       special mention, substandard or        \n       doubtful as of June\u00a030, 2020 and       \n  (a)  December 31, 2019.                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nHome Equity and Residential Real Estate\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators,\nincluding delinquency information,\nnonperforming loan information, updated credit\nscores, originated and updated LTV ratios to\nmonitor and manage credit risk within the home\nequity and residential real estate loan\nclasses. A summary of credit quality\nindicators follows:\n\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor\ntrending of delinquency/delinquency rates for\nhome equity and residential real estate loans.\nSee Table 44 for additional information.\n\nNonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of\nnonperforming loans for home equity and\nresidential real estate loans. See Table 44\nfor additional information.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 73 Credit Scores: We use a national\nthird-party provider to update FICO credit\nscores for home equity and residential real\nestate loans at least quarterly. The updated\nscores are incorporated into a series of\ncredit management reports, which are utilized\nto monitor the risk in the loan classes. LTV\n(inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV)\nfor first and subordinate lien positions): At\nleast annually, we update the property values\nof real estate collateral and calculate an\nupdated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines\nsecured by real estate in regions experiencing\nsignificant declines in property values, more\nfrequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV\nmigration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes. We use a\ncombination of original LTV and updated LTV\nfor internal risk management and reporting\npurposes ( e.g. , line management, loss\nmitigation strategies). In addition to the\nfact that estimated property values by their\nnature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations it is important to note that\nupdated LTVs may be based upon management\u2019s\nassumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider,\nHPI changes will be incorporated in arriving\nat management\u2019s estimate of updated LTV).\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled\nproperty values. The related estimates and\ninputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation\nmodels, broker price opinions, HPI indices,\nproperty location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and\nmanagement assumptions. We generally utilize\norigination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include\nan amortization assumption when calculating\nupdated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the\ncalculations do not represent actual appraised\nloan level collateral or updated LTV based\nupon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to\nchange as we refine our methodology.\n\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the home equity and residential\nreal estate loan classes.\nTable 47 : Home Equity and Residential Real\nEstate Credit Quality Indicators\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n74 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  December                                    \n  31, 2019                        Residenti\u2026  \n  -

For all loan types, we\ngenerally use a combination of internal loan\nparameters as well as an updated FICO score.\nWe use FICO scores as a primary credit quality\nindicator for automobile and credit card\nloans, as well as non-government guaranteed or\nnon-insured education loans and other secured\nand unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit\nmetrics, such as delinquency status, are\nheavily relied upon as credit quality\nindicators for government guaranteed or\ninsured education loans and consumer loans to\nhigh net worth individuals, as internal credit\nmetrics are more relevant than FICO scores for\nthese types of loans.\n\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency\ntrends and losses for each class, FICO credit\nscore updates are obtained at least quarterly\nalong with a variety of credit bureau\nattributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend\nto have a lower likelihood of loss.\nConversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to\nhave a higher likelihood of loss.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 75\nThe following table presents credit quality   \nindicators for the automobile, credit card,   \neducation and other consumer loan classes.    \nTable 48 : Credit Quality Indicators for\nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer Loan Classes\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  -

Our continuing involvement\ngenerally consists of servicing, repurchasing\npreviously transferred loans under certain\nconditions and loss share arrangements, and,\nin limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the securitization\nspecial purpose entities (SPEs). We earn\nservicing and other ancillary fees for our\nrole as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 9 Commitments\nand Note 12 Fair Value for information on our\nservicing rights, including the carrying value\nof servicing assets.

The expected and actual rates of\nmortgage loan prepayments are significant\nfactors driving the fair value. Management\nuses both internal proprietary models and a\nthird-party model to estimate future\ncommercial mortgage loan prepayments and a\nthird-party model to estimate future\nresidential mortgage loan prepayments. These\nmodels have been refined based on current\nmarket conditions and management judgment.\nFuture interest rates are another important\nfactor in the valuation of MSRs. Management\nutilizes market implied forward interest rates\nto estimate the future direction of mortgage\nand discount rates. The forward rates utilized\nare derived from the current yield curve for\nU.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are\nconsistent with pricing of capital markets\ninstruments. Changes in the shape and slope of\nthe forward curve in future periods may result\nin volatility in the fair value estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 58 and 59 . These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in\n\n82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q prepayment rate estimates, could\nresult in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities. The following\ntables set forth the fair value of commercial\nand residential MSRs and the sensitivity\nanalysis of the hypothetical effect on the\nfair value of MSRs to immediate adverse\nchanges of 10% and 20% in those assumptions.\nTable 58 : Commercial Mortgage Servicing\nRights \u2013 Key Valuation Assumptions\n                                              \n  Dollars

Approximately 96% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass as of June 30, 2020 , with the\nremainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them. The standby\nletters of credit outstanding on June 30, 2020\nhad terms ranging from less than one year to\nsix years.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020 , assets of $ 1.1billion\nsecured certain specifically identified\nstandby letters of credit. In addition, a\nportion of the remaining standby letters of\ncredit issued on behalf of specific customers\nis also secured by collateral or guarantees\nthat secure the customers\u2019 other obligations\nto us. The carrying amount of the liability\nfor our obligations related to standby letters\nof credit and participations in standby\nletters of credit was $ .2billion at June 30,\n2020 and is included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 85 N OTE 10 T OTAL E QUITY A ND O THER C\nOMPREHENSIVE I NCOME Activity in total equity\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2020 and\n2019 is as follows.\nTable 64 : Rollforward of Total Equity\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The par value of our preferred stock   \n  (a)  outstanding was less than$.5millionat  \n       each date and, therefore, is excluded  \n       from this presentation.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the cumulative effect of    \n       adopting ASU 2016-02 -Leasesrelated    \n       primarily to deferred gains on         \n  (b)  previous sale-leaseback transactions.  \n       See the Recently Adopted Accounting    \n       Standards portion of Note 1            \n       Accounting Policies in our 2019 Form   \n       10-K for additional detail.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the cumulative effect of    \n       adopting ASU 2016-13 - Financial       \n       Instruments -Credit Losses.

Value Measurement\nWe measure certain financial assets and\nliabilities at fair value. Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate, and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2019\nForm 10-K.

ERIVATIVES We\nuse a variety of financial derivatives to both\nmitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risk inherent in our\nbusiness activities, as well as, to facilitate\ncustomer risk management activities. We manage\nthese risks as part of our overall asset and\nliability management process and through our\ncredit policies and procedures. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional amount and an\nunderlying as specified in the contract.\nDerivative transactions are often measured in\nterms of notional amount, but this amount is\ngenerally not exchanged and it is not recorded\non the balance sheet. The notional amount is\nthe basis to which the underlying is applied\nto determine required payments under the\nderivative contract. The underlying is a\nreferenced interest rate (commonly LIBOR),\nsecurity price, credit spread or other index.\nResidential and commercial real estate loan\ncommitments associated with loans to be sold\nalso qualify as derivative instruments.

Derivatives hedging the\nrisks associated with changes in the fair\nvalue of assets or liabilities are considered\nfair value hedges, derivatives hedging the\nvariability of expected future cash flows are\nconsidered cash flow hedges, and derivatives\nhedging a net investment in a foreign\nsubsidiary are considered net investment\nhedges. Designating derivatives as accounting\nhedges allows for gains and losses on those\nderivatives to be recognized in the same\nperiod and in the same income statement line\nitem as the earnings impact of the hedged\nitems. Fair Value Hedges We enter into\nreceive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\noutstanding fixed-rate debt caused by\nfluctuations in market interest rates. We also\nenter into pay-fixed, receive-variable\ninterest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to\nhedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate\nand zero-coupon investment securities caused\nby fluctuations in market interest rates.\nGains and losses on the interest rate swaps\ndesignated in these hedge relationships, along\nwith the offsetting gains and losses on the\nhedged items attributable to the hedged risk,\nare recognized in current earnings within the\nsame income statement line item. Cash Flow\nHedges We enter into receive-fixed, pay-\nvariable interest rate swaps to modify the\ninterest rate characteristics of designated\ncommercial loans from variable to fixed in\norder to reduce the impact of changes in\nfuture cash flows due to market interest rate\nchanges. We also periodically enter into\nforward purchase and sale contracts to hedge\nthe variability of the consideration that will\nbe paid or received related to the purchase or\nsale of investment securities. The forecasted\npurchase or sale is consummated upon gross\nsettlement of the forward contract itself. For\nthese cash flow hedges, gains and losses on\nthe interest rate swaps and forward contracts\nare recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified\ninto earnings in the same period the hedged\ncash flows affect earnings and within the same\nincome statement line as the hedged cash\nflows. In the 12 months that follow June 30,\n2020 , we expect to reclassify net derivative\ngains of $ 471million pretax, or $ 372million\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nboth cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to June 30, 2020 .\nAs of June 30, 2020 , the maximum length of\ntime over which forecasted transactions are\nhedged is ten years.

net investments in foreign\nsubsidiaries against adverse changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We assess whether the\nhedging relationship is highly effective in\nachieving offsetting changes in the value of\nthe hedge and hedged item by qualitatively\nverifying that the critical terms of the hedge\nand hedged item match at the inception of the\nhedging relationship and on an ongoing basis.\nNet investment hedge derivatives are\nclassified as foreign exchange contracts.\nThere were no components of derivative gains\nor losses excluded from the assessment of the\nhedge effectiveness for all periods presented.\nGains on net investment hedge derivatives\nrecognized in OCI were $

the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet for those\nderivative financial instruments entered into\nwith counterparties under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements. The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting, counterparty credit risk and\ncontingent features, see Note 13 Financial\nDerivatives in our 2019 Form 10-K.\n\nTable 80 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nas of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .\nThe table includes cash collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements. The table also includes\nthe fair value of any securities collateral\nheld or pledged under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements. Cash and securities\ncollateral amounts are included in the table\nonly to the extent of the related net\nderivative fair values.\n\nTable 80 includes over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives and OTC derivatives cleared\nthrough a central clearing house. OTC\nderivatives represent contracts executed\nbilaterally with counterparties that are not\nsettled through an organized exchange or\ndirectly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (ISDA) documentation\nor other legally enforceable master netting\nagreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent\ncontracts executed bilaterally with\ncounterparties in the OTC market that are\nnovated to a central clearing house who then\nbecomes our counterparty. OTC cleared\nderivative instruments are typically settled\nin cash each day based on the prior day value.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 103\nTable 80 : Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the net amount of           \n  (a)  derivative assets included in Other    \n       assets on our Consolidated Balance     \n       Sheet.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the net amount of           \n  (b)  derivative liabilities included in     \n       Other liabilities on our Consolidated  \n       Balance Sheet.                         \n                                              \nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt June 30, 2020 , we held cash, U.S.\ngovernment securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities totaling $ 2.7billion under master\nnetting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties, and we pledged\ncash totaling $ 2.0billion under these\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nliabilities owed to counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements. These totals may\ndiffer from the amounts presented in the\npreceding offsetting table because these\ntotals may include collateral exchanged under\nan agreement that does not qualify as a master\nnetting agreement or because the total amount\nof collateral held or pledged exceeds the net\nderivative fair values with the counterparty\nas of the balance sheet date due to timing or\nother factors, such as initial margin. To the\nextent not netted against the derivative fair\nvalues under a master netting agreement, the\nreceivable for cash pledged is included in\nOther assets and the obligation for cash held\nis included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held\nfrom counterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q Certain derivative agreements\ncontain various credit-risk related contingent\nprovisions, such as those that require our\ndebt to maintain a specified credit rating\nfrom one or more of the major credit rating\nagencies. If our debt ratings were to fall\nbelow such specified ratings, the\ncounterparties to the derivative instruments\ncould request immediate payment or demand\nimmediate and ongoing full collateralization\non derivative instruments in net liability\npositions. The aggregate fair value of all\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features that were in a net\nliability position on June 30, 2020 was $\n3.1billion for which we had posted collateral\nof $ 2.5billion in the normal course of\nbusiness. The maximum additional amount of\ncollateral we would have been required to post\nif the credit-risk-related contingent features\nunderlying these agreements had been triggered\non June 30, 2020 would be $ .6billion . N OTE\n14 L EGAL P ROCEEDINGS We establish accruals\nfor legal proceedings, including litigation\nand regulatory and governmental investigations\nand inquiries, when information related to the\nloss contingencies represented by those\nmatters indicates both that a loss is probable\nand that the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in Note 19 Legal\nProceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our 2019\nForm 10-K and in Note 13 Legal Proceedings in\nPart I, Item 1 of our first quarter 2020 Form\n10-Q (such prior disclosure referred to as\n\u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters\nwhere we are able to estimate such possible\nlosses or ranges of possible losses, as of\nJune 30, 2020 , we estimate that it is\nreasonably possible that we could incur losses\nin excess of related accrued liabilities, if\nany, in an aggregate amount less than $\n100million . The estimates included in this\namount are based on our analysis of currently\navailable information and are subject to\nsignificant judgment and a variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties. As new\ninformation is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount. As a\nresult of the types of factors described in\nNote 19 in our 2019 Form 10-K, we are unable,\nat this time, to estimate the losses that are\nreasonably possible to be incurred or ranges\nof such losses with respect to some of the\nmatters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated\namount provided above does not include an\nestimate for every Disclosed Matter.\nTherefore, as the estimated aggregate amount\ndisclosed above does not include all of the\nDisclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above\ndoes not represent our maximum reasonably\npossible loss exposure for all of the\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d We include in\nsome of the descriptions of individual\nDisclosed Matters certain quantitative\ninformation related to the plaintiff\u2019s claim\nagainst us as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s\npleadings or other public filings or otherwise\npublicly available information. While\ninformation of this type may provide insight\ninto the potential magnitude of a matter, it\ndoes not necessarily represent our estimate of\nreasonably possible loss or our judgment as to\nany currently appropriate accrual. Some of our\nexposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by\napplicable insurance coverage. We do not\nconsider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\nOther Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries We\nare the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad range of\nissues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage,\nsecurities and other financial services\nbusinesses, as well as other aspects of our\noperations. In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of reviews of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries, including those\ndescribed in Prior Disclosure, may involve or\nlead to regulatory enforcement actions and\nother administrative proceedings, and may lead\nto civil or criminal judicial proceedings.\nSome of these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences. Our practice is to cooperate\nfully with regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations, audits and other inquiries,\nincluding those described in Prior Disclosure.\nOther In addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q 105 monetary damages and other\nrelief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at\nthe present time, that the ultimate aggregate\nliability, if any, arising out of such other\nlegal proceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.

There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\nDuring the second quarter, we divested our    \nentire 22.4% investment in BlackRock. See Note\n2 Discontinued Operations for additional      \ninformation on the sale and details on our    \nresults and cash flows for the three and six  \nmonths ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Following\nthe sale and donation, PNC and its affiliates \nonly hold shares of BlackRock stock in a      \nfiduciary capacity for clients of PNC and its \naffiliates.                                   \nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income.\nThese differences are reflected in the \u201cOther\u201d\ncategory in the business segment tables.\n\u201cOther\u201d includes residual activities that do\nnot meet the criteria for disclosure as a\nseparate reportable business, such as asset\nand liability management activities including\nnet securities gains or losses, other-than-\ntemporary impairment of investment securities,\ncertain trading activities, certain runoff\nconsumer loan portfolios, private equity\ninvestments, intercompany eliminations,\ncertain corporate overhead, tax adjustments\nthat are not allocated to business segments,\nexited businesses and differences between\nbusiness segment performance reporting and\nfinancial statement reporting (GAAP),\nincluding the presentation of net income\nattributable to noncontrolling interests as\nthe segments\u2019 results exclude their portion of\nnet income attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests. The \u201cOther\u201d category also includes\nour BlackRock held for sale asset. Assets,\nrevenue and earnings attributable to foreign\nactivities were not material in the period\npresented for comparison.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstand-alone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology.

We announced on      \n       March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension  \n       of our common stock repurchase         \n       program in conjunction with the        \n       Federal Reserve's effort to support    \n       the U.S. economy during the pandemic,  \n       and will continue the suspension       \n       through the third quarter of 2020,     \n       with the exception of share            \n       repurchases to offset the effects of   \n       employee benefit plan-related          \n       issuances as permitted by recent       \n       guidance from the Federal Reserve.     \n       The estimated amount is $100 million   \n       in the third quarter of 2020, but the  \n       timing and amount of executed          \n       repurchases will be based on market    \n       conditions and other factors.          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Average price paid for immaterial      \n       amounts of PNC common stock purchased  \n       in connection with our various         \n  (c)  employee benefit plans generally       \n       related to shares used to cover        \n       employee payroll tax withholding       \n       requirements.                          \n                                              \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 113 ITEM 6.
