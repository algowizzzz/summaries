Stock Purchase Agreement On\nNovember 15, 2020, The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. (\u201cPNC\u201d) entered into a Stock\nPurchase Agreement (the \u201cStock Purchase\nAgreement\u201d) with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya\nArgentaria, S.A. (\u201cBBVA\u201d). Upon the terms and\nsubject to the conditions set forth in the\nStock Purchase Agreement, PNC will purchase\nfrom BBVA 100% of the issued and outstanding\nshares of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. (the\n\u201cStock Purchase\u201d), a financial holding company\n(\u201cBBVA USA Holdco\u201d) conducting its business\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA, an Alabama-chartered\nbank (\u201cBBVA USA Bank\u201d), for $11.6 billion in\ncash on hand in a fixed price structure,\nsubject to certain adjustments related to\ntransaction expenses and tax matters. PNC is\nnot acquiring BBVA Securities, Inc., Propel\nVenture Partners Fund I, L.P. and BBVA\nProcessing Services, Inc. (the \u201cCarve-Out\nTransactions\u201d). Immediately following the\nclosing of the Stock Purchase, PNC intends to\nmerge BBVA USA Holdco with and into PNC, with\nPNC continuing as the surviving entity. Post-\nclosing, PNC intends to merge BBVA USA Bank\nwith and into PNC Bank, National Association,\nan indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PNC\n(\u201cPNC Bank\u201d), with PNC Bank continuing as the\nsurviving entity. The completion of the Stock\nPurchase is subject to certain conditions,\nincluding, among others, the absence of any\ninjunction or other legal prohibition on the\ncompletion of the Stock Purchase, the receipt\nof required governmental approvals and/or the\nexpiration of certain waiting periods, the\naccuracy of the representations and warranties\nof the other party (generally subject to a\nmaterial adverse effect standard), material\ncompliance by the other party with its\nobligations under the Stock Purchase\nAgreement, and the completion of the Carve-Out\nTransactions prior to closing. Under the Stock\nPurchase Agreement, BBVA has agreed to take or\nrefrain from taking certain actions,\nincluding, among others, (i) to cause BBVA USA\nHoldco and its subsidiaries, including BBVA\nUSA Bank, to operate in the ordinary course of\nbusiness consistent with past practice and not\nto enter into certain types of transactions\nbetween the execution of the Stock Purchase\nAgreement and the closing of the Stock\nPurchase and (ii) subject to certain\nexceptions, not to (a) engage in a retail\nbanking business in the U.S. for two years\nfollowing the closing of the Stock Purchase,\nor (b) solicit or hire any employees of BBVA\nUSA Holdco or its subsidiaries, including BBVA\nUSA Bank, for one year following the closing\nof the Stock Purchase. Under the Stock\nPurchase Agreement, PNC has agreed to take or\nrefrain from taking certain actions,\nincluding, among others, (i) to use reasonable\nbest efforts to obtain any necessary\nregulatory consents and (ii) subject to\ncertain exceptions contained in the Stock\nPurchase Agreement, not to solicit or hire any\nBBVA employees retained by BBVA for one year\nfollowing the closing of the Stock Purchase.\nThe Stock Purchase Agreement contains\ncustomary representations and warranties of\nBBVA and PNC. The Stock Purchase Agreement\nalso contains certain indemnification\nobligations of each party with respect to\nbreaches of representations, warranties and\ncovenants and certain other specified matters.\nThe Stock Purchase Agreement contains certain\ntermination rights for PNC and BBVA, as the\ncase may be, applicable upon, among other\nevents, (i) the Stock Purchase having not been\ncompleted on or prior to November 15, 2021\n(subject to extension in certain\ncircumstance), or (ii) a breach by the other\nparty that is not or cannot be cured within 45\ndays\u2019 notice of such breach or is not capable\nof being cured by November 15, 2021, which\nbreach would result in the failure of the\nconditions to the terminating party\u2019s\nobligations to complete the transactions\ncontemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement.\nThe foregoing description of the Stock\nPurchase and the Stock Purchase Agreement does\nnot purport to be complete and is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the Stock\nPurchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit\n2.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this\nreport by reference. The Stock Purchase\nAgreement and the above description of the\nStock Purchase Agreement have been included to\nprovide investors and security holders with\ninformation regarding the terms of the Stock\nPurchase Agreement. It is not intended to\nprovide any other factual information about\nPNC, BBVA or their respective subsidiaries and\naffiliates. The Stock Purchase Agreement\ncontains representations and warranties of\neach of PNC, on the one hand, and BBVA, on the\nother hand, made solely for the benefit of the\nother. The assertions embodied in those\nrepresentations and warranties are qualified\nby information in confidential disclosure\nschedules that the parties have exchanged in\nconnection with signing the Stock Purchase\nAgreement. The disclosure schedules contain\ninformation that modifies, qualifies and\ncreates exceptions to the representations and\nwarranties set forth in the Stock Purchase\nAgreement. In addition, such representations\nand warranties may apply standards of\nmateriality in a way that is different from\nwhat may be viewed as material by security\nholders of, or other investors in, PNC or\nBBVA. Moreover, the representations and\nwarranties in the Stock Purchase Agreement\nwere used for the purpose of allocating risk\nbetween PNC, on the one hand, and BBVA, on the\nother hand, and not necessarily for\nestablishing matters as fact, and information\nconcerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants may\nchange after the date of the Stock Purchase\nAgreement, which subsequent information may or\nmay not be fully reflected in the parties\u2019\npublic disclosures. Security holders and\ninvestors are not third-party beneficiaries\nunder the Stock Purchase Agreement.\nAccordingly, you should read the\nrepresentations and warranties in the Stock\nPurchase Agreement not in isolation but only\nin conjunction with the other information\nabout PNC and BBVA, or any of their respective\nsubsidiaries or affiliates that the respective\ncompanies include in reports, statements and\nother filings they make with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, and you should not\nrely on the representations, warranties and\ncovenants or any descriptions thereof as\ncharacterizations of the actual state of facts\nor condition of PNC or BBVA, or any of their\nrespective subsidiaries or affiliates.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING\nINFORMATION This Report contains forward-\nlooking statements regarding our outlook or\nexpectations with respect to the planned\nacquisition of BBVA USA Holdco, the\ncombination of BBVA USA Holdco into PNC and\nBBVA USA Bank into PNC Bank, and the impact of\nthe transaction on PNC\u2019s future performance.\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Report\nspeak only as of the date of this Report, and\nwe assume no duty, and do not undertake, to\nupdate them. Actual results or future events\ncould differ, possibly materially, from those\nthat we anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements. Forward-looking statements in this\nReport are subject to the following risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransaction itself and to the integration of\nthe acquired business into PNC after closing:\n                                              \n     The business of BBVA USA Holdco,         \n     including its U.S. banking subsidiary,   \n     BBVA USA Bank, may not perform as we     \n     currently project or in a manner         \n     consistent with historical performance.  \n     As a result, the anticipated benefits,   \n  \u2022  including estimated cost savings, of     \n     the transaction may be significantly     \n     harder or take longer to achieve than    \n     expected or may not be achieved in       \n     their entirety as a result of            \n     unexpected factors or events, including  \n     those that are outside of our control.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     The combination of BBVA USA Holdco,      \n     including its U.S. banking subsidiary,   \n     BBVA USA Bank, with that of PNC and PNC  \n     Bank may be more difficult to achieve    \n  \u2022  than anticipated or have unanticipated   \n     adverse results relating to BBVA USA     \n     Holdco, including its U.S. banking       \n     subsidiary, BBVA USA Bank, or our        \n     existing businesses.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Completion of the transaction is         \n     dependent on the satisfaction of         \n     customary closing conditions, which      \n  \u2022  cannot be assured. The timing of         \n     completion of the transaction is         \n     dependent on various factors that        \n     cannot be predicted with precision at    \n     this point.                              \n                                              \nThese forward-looking statements are also\nsubject to the principal risks and\nuncertainties applicable to our businesses\ngenerally that are disclosed in PNC\u2019s 2019\nForm 10-K and 2020 Form 10-Qs and in PNC\u2019s\nsubsequent SEC filings.
