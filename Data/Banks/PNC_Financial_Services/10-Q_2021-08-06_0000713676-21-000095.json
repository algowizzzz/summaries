this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report or\nForm 10-Q) and with Items 6, 7, 8 and 9A of\nour 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2020 Form\n10-K). We have reclassified certain prior\nperiod amounts to conform with the current\nperiod presentation, which we believe is more\nmeaningful to readers of our consolidated\nfinancial statements.

Also, see\nthe Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Information section in this Financial\nReview and the Critical Accounting Estimates\nand Judgments section in this Financial Review\nand in our 2020 Form 10-K for certain other\nfactors that could cause actual results or\nfuture events to differ, perhaps materially,\nfrom historical performance and from those\nanticipated in the forward-looking statements\nincluded in this Report.

information\nregarding items impacting the comparability of\nthe periods presented.\n\n(b) Dividends are payable quarterly other than\nSeries O, Series R and Series S preferred\nstock, which are payable semiannually, with\nthe Series O payable in different quarters\nthan the Series R and Series S preferred\nstock. Beginning on August 1, dividends will\nbe paid on the Series O on a quarterly basis\n(February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of\neach year).\n\n(c) The effective income tax rates are\ngenerally lower than the statutory rate due to\nthe relationship of pretax income to tax\ncredits and earnings that are not subject to\ntax.\n\n(d) Net interest margin is the total yield on\ninterest-earning assets minus the total rate\non interest-bearing liabilities and includes\nthe benefit from use of noninterest-bearing\nsources. To provide more meaningful\ncomparisons of net interest margins, we use\nnet interest income on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis in calculating average yields used in\nthe calculation of net interest margin by\nincreasing the interest income earned on tax-\nexempt assets to make it fully equivalent to\ninterest income earned on taxable investments.\nThis adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in\nthe Consolidated Income Statement.

(BBVA) for cash consideration\nof $11.5 billion. BBVA, a U.S. financial\nholding company conducting its business\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA, operates more than 600\nbranches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona,\nCalifornia, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico.\nOur results for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 reflect BBVA's operations for\nthe month of June 2021 and our June 30, 2021\nbalance sheet includes BBVA's balances,\nincluding $95.7 billion of total assets, $82.2\nbillion of deposits and $60.5 billion of\nloans.\n\nShortly after the acquisition, PNC merged BBVA\ninto PNC, and PNC contributed all of the\nshares of BBVA USA to PNC\n\nBancorp, Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nPNC. As a result, BBVA USA is now a subsidiary\nof PNC Bancorp, Inc. and an affiliate of PNC\nBank. PNC expects to merge BBVA USA into PNC\nBank in October 2021.\n\nThroughout this Report, BBVA USA Bancshares,\nInc. will be referred to as BBVA.\n                                              \n  Discontinued Operations                     \n                                              \nIn the second quarter of 2020, we divested our\nentire 22.4% equity investment in BlackRock.\nNet proceeds from the sale were\n\n$14.2 billion with an after-tax gain on sale\nof $4.3 billion.

Provision for\ncredit losses was $2.5 billion for the second\nquarter of 2020.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $535 million,\nor 21%, to $3.1 billion, due to $179 million\nof BBVA operating expenses, $101 million of\nintegration expenses, growth in business and\nmarketing activity and additions to legal\nreserves during the second quarter of 2021.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nIncome Statement Review section of this\nFinancial Review.\n                                              \n  Balance Sheet Highlights                    \n                                              \nOur balance sheet was strong and well\npositioned at June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. In comparison to December 31, 2020,\nchanges in our balance sheet were primarily\ndriven by the BBVA acquisition.\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased $87.5 billion, or\n19%, to $554.2 billion, including $95.7\nbillion from BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Total loans increased $52.8 billion, or 22%,\nto $294.7 billion, including $60.5 billion\nfrom BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans increased $32.4\nbillion, or 19%, to $199.6 billion driven by\nBBVA loans of $38.5 billion, partially offset\nby PNC legacy PPP loan forgiveness and lower\nmultifamily agency warehouse lending.\n\n\u2022 At June 30, 2021, PNC had $11.6 billion of\nPPP loans and included $2.1 billion from BBVA.\nPPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020\nwere $12.0 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans increased $20.3\nbillion, or 27%, to $95.1 billion driven by\nloans from BBVA of $22.0 billion and increased\noriginations of PNC legacy residential\nmortgages, partially offset by declines in\nremaining PNC legacy portfolios as paydowns\noutpaced new originations.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities increased $37.7\nbillion, or 43%, to $126.5 billion, resulting\nfrom $17.6 in securities from BBVA and\nincreased purchase activity.\n\n\u2022 Interest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the Federal Reserve Bank,\ndecreased $12.7 billion to $72.4 billion,\nprimarily due to the payment of $11.5 billion\nin cash for the purchase of BBVA and increased\nsecurities purchases, partially offset by\n$12.0 billion from BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits increased $87.5 billion, or\n24%, to $452.9 billion, including $82.2\nbillion from BBVA, due to growth in commercial\nand consumer deposits.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds decreased $2.4 billion, or\n6%, to $34.8 billion, due to lower FHLB\nborrowings reflecting the use of liquidity\nfrom deposit growth, partially offset by $2.3\nbillion from BBVA.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nSecond quarter 2021 credit quality performance\nincluded the acquisition of BBVA and the\nassociated purchase accounting impacts.\n\n\u2022 At June 30, 2021 compared to December 31,\n2020:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets of $2.8 billion,\nincreased $481 million, or 21%, due to $880\nmillion of nonperforming assets from BBVA,\npartially offset by lower PNC legacy\nnonperforming assets reflecting improved\ncredit performance.\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion\ndecreased $73 million, or 5%, driven by lower\nPNC legacy consumer and commercial\ndelinquencies, partially offset by $291\nmillion in delinquencies resulting from the\nBBVA acquisition.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans increased to $6.4\nbillion, or 2.16% of total loans, at June 30,\n2021 compared to $5.9 billion, or 2.46% of\ntotal loans, at December 31, 2020. The\nincrease was attributable to the ACL\nassociated with the BBVA portfolio, which was\nrecognized through both a fair value purchase\naccounting mark of $1.2 billion and an initial\nprovision for credit losses of $1.0 billion,\npartially offset by a provision recapture of\n$1.3 billion and net loan charge-offs of $0.5\nbillion.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs were $306 million, or 0.48%\nof average loans on an annualized basis, in\nthe second quarter of 2021. This included $248\nmillion related to BBVA, which were largely\nthe result of required purchase accounting\ntreatment for the acquisition. Net charge-offs\nwere $236 million, or 0.35%, for the same\nquarter of 2020.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Capital Highlights                          \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital and liquidity\npositions.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio decreased to 10.1% at June\n30, 2021 from 12.2% at December 31, 2020,\nprimarily due to the BBVA acquisition.\n\n\u2022 Capital was impacted by our election of a\nfive-year transition period for CECL's\nestimated impact on CET1 capital. CECL's\nestimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as\nthe change in retained earnings at adoption\nplus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at\nthe balance sheet date, excluding the initial\nallowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to\nCECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL\nimpact is added to CET1 capital through\nDecember 31, 2021, then phased-out over the\nfollowing three years.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders' equity increased to\n$51.1 billion at June 30, 2021, compared to\n$50.5 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\n\u2022 In the second quarter, we returned capital\nto shareholders through dividends on common\nshares of $0.5 billion and refrained from\nrepurchasing shares through the second quarter\nof 2021 due to the BBVA transaction.\n\n\u2022 During the second quarter, PNC announced the\nreinstatement of share repurchase programs\nwith repurchases of up to $2.9 billion for the\nfour-quarter period beginning in the third\nquarter of 2021.\n\n\u2022 On July 1, 2021, the PNC Board of Directors\nraised the quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock to $1.25 per share, an increase of 10\ncents per share, or 9%, effective with the\nAugust 5, 2021 dividend payment.\n\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nFinancial Review for more detail on our 2021\nliquidity and capital actions as well as our\ncapital ratios.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a\nstress capital buffer established by the\nFederal Reserve Board in connection with the\nFederal Reserve Board's CCAR process.

These statements are based on\nour views, as follows:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2022 With passage of the American Rescue Plan Act\nof 2021 and continued vaccine distribution,\neconomic growth has picked up in 2021 and will\nremain very strong through the rest of this\nyear and into 2022. Real GDP returned to its\npre-pandemic level in the second quarter of\n2021. Employment in June 2021 was still down\nby 6.8 million from before the pandemic; PNC\nexpects employment to return to its pre-\npandemic level in the spring of 2022.\n\n\u2022 Compared to the spring of 2020 (when prices\nwere falling), inflation has accelerated in\nmid-2021 due to strong demand in specific\nsegments and supply chain disruptions.\nInflation will slow in the second half of\n2021.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25%\nuntil mid-2023.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2021, compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2021 where appropriate, we\nexpect:\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be up modestly,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up in the mid-\nteens, on a percentage basis,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be up mid-single digits, on a\npercentage basis,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income to be between $325\nmillion and $375 million,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense excluding integration\nexpense to be up high-single digits, on a\npercentage basis, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $150\nmillion and $200 million.\n\nFor the full year 2021, compared to full year\n2020 except as noted, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be up modestly from June\n30, 2021,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up approximately 12% to 14%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense excluding integration\nexpense to be up approximately 13% to 15%, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be 17%.\n\nAdditionally, we are on track to realize $900\nmillion in net expense savings of BBVA's\nexpense base in 2022.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nNet interest income increased $54 million, or\n2%, for the second quarter of 2021, and\ndecreased $109 million, or 2%, for the first\nsix months of 2021 compared to the same\nperiods in 2020. In the quarterly comparison,\nthe increase was due to interest earning\nassets from the BBVA acquisition and lower\nrates on deposits, partially offset by lower\nPNC legacy loans outstanding and securities\nyields. In the year-to-date comparison, the\ndecrease was due to lower PNC legacy loans\noutstanding and lower securities yields,\npartially offset by lower deposit rates and\ninterest earning assets from BBVA.\n\nNet interest margin in the quarterly and year-\nto-date comparisons decreased 23 basis points\nand 39 basis points, respectively. The\ndecrease in both comparisons reflected higher\nbalances held with the Federal Reserve Bank\nand lower yields on securities, partially\noffset by the impact of BBVA's interest\nearning assets.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $20.1\nbillion, or 23%, and $11.1 billion, or 13%, in\nthe quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively. Both comparisons increased\nprimarily due to higher U.S. Treasury and\ngovernment securities, resulting from\nincreased purchase activity and the\nacquisition of BBVA. Average investment\nsecurities represented 24% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the second quarter\nof 2021 and 22% for the first six months of\n2021, compared to 22% and 23% for the same\nperiods in 2020.\n\nAverage loans decreased $12.5 billion, or 5%,\nand $8.9 billion, or 3% in the quarterly and\nyear-to-date comparisons, respectively. In the\nquarterly comparison, the decrease was due to\nlower utilization of loan commitments by\ncommercial customers. In the year-to-date\ncomparison, the decrease was due to lower\ncommercial and consumer loans. The decrease in\nboth comparisons was partially offset by loans\nfrom the BBVA acquisition. Average loans\nrepresented 57% of average interest-earning\nassets for the three and six months ended June\n30, 2021, compared to 67% and 68% for the same\nperiods in 2020.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nincreased $43.9 billion and $55.9 billion in\nthe respective quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons, as average balances held with the\nFederal Reserve Bank increased due to higher\ndeposits.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits grew $28.0\nbillion, or 12%, and $32.4 billion, or 14% in\nthe respective quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons due to overall growth in\ncommercial and consumer liquidity, including\ndeposits from BBVA. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits increased to 89% and\n88% of average interest-bearing liabilities\nfor the three and six months ended June 30,\n2021, compared to 82% and 81% for the same\nperiods in 2020.\n\nAverage borrowed funds decreased $19.1\nbillion, or 36%, compared with the second\nquarter of 2020 and $20.5 billion, or 37%,\ncompared with the first six months of 2020\nprimarily due to a decline in FHLB borrowings\nreflecting the use of liquidity from deposit\ngrowth.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 3: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 45% for both the second quarter\nand first six months of 2021, compared to 38%\nand 40% for the same periods in 2020.\n\nAsset management revenue increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons due to\nthe impact of higher average equity markets.\nPNC's discretionary client assets under\nmanagement increased to $183 billion at June\n30, 2021 from $151 billion at June 30, 2020,\nprimarily driven by higher spot equity\nmarkets.\n\nConsumer services revenue increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nreflecting the impacts of higher consumer\nspending on debit card, merchant services, and\ncredit card fees and higher average equity\nmarkets on brokerage fees.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 7\nCorporate services revenue increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nprimarily due to higher merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees, treasury management product\nrevenue, revenue from commercial mortgage\nservicing activities and loan commitment fees.\n\nResidential mortgage revenue decreased in the\nquarterly comparison primarily due to lower\nservicing fee revenue and decreased in the\nyear-to-date comparison due to both lower\nmortgage servicing rights valuation, net of\neconomic hedge and lower servicing fee\nrevenue.

and December 31,\n2020.\n\n\u2022 Total asset growth reflected the addition of\nloans and investment securities from the BBVA\nacquisition, partially offset by a decrease in\ninterest-earning deposits with banks.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased primarily due to\ndeposit growth reflecting higher commercial\nand consumer deposits driven by the\nacquisition of BBVA, partially offset by lower\nborrowed funds.\n\n\u2022 Total equity increased primarily due to\nsecond quarter net income, partially offset by\nlower AOCI and dividends paid on common and\npreferred stock.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $6.4 billion\nat June 30, 2021, an increase of $0.4 billion\nsince December 31, 2020. The increase was\nattributable to the ACL associated with the\nBBVA portfolio, which was recognized through\nboth a fair value purchase accounting mark of\n$1.2 billion and an initial provision for\ncredit losses of $1.0 billion, partially\noffset by a provision recapture of $1.3\nbillion and net loan charge-offs of $0.5\nbillion.

Certain amounts included in this\nBusiness Segments Review differ from those\namounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the\npresentation in this Financial Review of\nbusiness net interest income on a taxable-\nequivalent basis.\n\nOur business segment results for the first six\nmonths of 2021 reflect BBVA's business\noperations for the month of June 2021 and our\nbalance sheet at June 30, 2021 includes BBVA's\nbalances. Until conversion of bank systems and\nbranches, PNC Bank and BBVA customers will\ncontinue to be served through their respective\nPNC Bank and BBVA USA branches, websites and\nmobile apps, financial advisors and\nrelationship managers. Upon conversion, which\nis expected to occur in October 2021, there\nwill be changes in the segmentation of BBVA\nUSA customers as we integrate data to PNC\napplications, finalize the review of customer\nrelationships and better align customers with\nPNC's products and services. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Report for\nadditional information on the acquisition of\nBBVA.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock,\nwhich had previously been reported as a\nseparate business segment. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Report for\nadditional information.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors.\n\nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income. The\nimpact of these differences is reflected in\nthe \u201cOther\u201d category as shown in Table 83 in\nNote 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Report. \u201cOther\u201d includes\nresidual activities that do not meet the\ncriteria for disclosure as a separate\nreportable business, such as asset and\nliability management activities including net\nsecurities gains or losses, ACL for investment\nsecurities, certain trading activities,\ncertain runoff consumer loan portfolios,\nprivate equity investments, intercompany\neliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax\nadjustments that are not allocated to business\nsegments, exited businesses and differences\nbetween business segment performance reporting\nand financial statement reporting (GAAP).\n\n12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Retail Banking                              \n                                              \nRetail Banking's core strategy is to help all\nof our consumer and small business customers\nmove financially forward.

noninterest expense. Results for the\nfirst six months of 2021 include the impact of\nBBVA's business operations for the month of\nJune 2021. Retail banking added $26.2 billion\nin loans and $41.4 billion in deposits at June\n30, 2021 attributable to the acquisition,\nalong with 647 branches and 824 ATMs.\n\nNet interest income was $2.9 billion,\nincluding $143 million from BBVA, and\nincreased primarily due to growth in average\ndeposit balances, partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on the value of deposits\nand loans, as well as declines in average loan\nbalances.\n\nNoninterest income was $1.4 billion, including\n$35 million from BBVA, and decreased largely\ndue to declines in residential mortgage\nrevenue, driven by lower revenue from\nresidential mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation, net of economic hedge and servicing\nfees primarily due to higher payoffs. The\ndecrease in noninterest income was partially\noffset by increased consumer services revenue\ndriven by debit card, brokerage fees, and\ncredit card, as well as the favorable impact\nof derivative fair value adjustments related\nto Visa Class B common shares in the first\nhalf of 2021 compared to unfavorable\nadjustments in the same period of 2020.\n\n14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nProvision recapture in the first six months of\n2021 was driven by improvements in credit\nquality and macroeconomic factors, coupled\nwith lower loans outstanding, partially offset\nby the initial provision for credit losses of\n$500 million related to the BBVA acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense was $3.2 billion,\nincluding $111 million related to BBVA, and\nincreased primarily as a result of higher non-\ncredit losses due to additions to litigation\nreserves, technology investments, personnel,\nand customer related transaction costs.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the\nfirst six months of 2021, average total\ndeposits increased compared to the same period\nin 2020 primarily driven by growth in demand\nand savings deposits which benefited from the\nimpact of government stimulus payments.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans decreased\nin the first six months of 2021 compared with\nthe same period in 2020:\n\n\u2022 Average auto loan balances declined due to\nimpacts of the pandemic on the auto industry\nand proactive credit tightening.\n\n\u2022 Average credit card balances decreased due\nto credit tightening actions taken as a result\nof the pandemic combined with changes in\ncustomer behavior resulting in higher balance\npaydowns driven by government stimulus\npayments.\n\n\u2022 Average home equity loans decreased as\npaydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated\nvolume.\n\n\u2022 Average other consumer loans declined driven\nby lower originations due to the pandemic and\nthe effects of government stimulus and credit\ntightening.\n\n\u2022 Average education loans decreased driven by\na decline in the runoff portfolio of\ngovernment guaranteed education loans.\n\n\u2022 Average commercial loans increased primarily\ndue to PPP loans.\n\n\u2022 Average residential real estate loans\nincreased due to originations outpacing\npaydowns.\n\nOur national expansion strategy is designed to\ngrow customers with digitally-led banking and\na thin branch network in markets outside of\nour existing retail branch network. In 2018,\nwe began offering our digital high yield\nsavings deposit product and opened our first\nsolution center in Kansas City, Kansas.\nSolution centers are an emerging branch\noperating model with a distinctive layout,\nwhere routine transactions are supported\nthrough a combination of technology and\nskilled banker assistance to create\npersonalized experiences. The primary focus of\nthe solution center is to bring a community\nelement to our digital banking capabilities.\nThe solution center provides a collaborative\nenvironment that connects our customers with\nour digital solutions and services, beyond\ndeposits and withdrawals. In 2020, we expanded\ninto three new markets, Boston, Houston and\nNashville and opened seventeen new solution\ncenters. In the first six months of 2021 we\nopened eight new solution centers and expanded\ninto two new markets, Denver and Phoenix. In\ntotal, we have thirty open solution centers\nwithin the markets of Boston, Dallas/Fort\nWorth, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Nashville\nand Phoenix. We also offer digital unsecured\ninstallment and small business loans in the\nexpansion markets. As a result of the BBVA\nacquisition, as of June 2021 we have become a\ncoast-to-coast Retail Bank.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of our\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking and investment products. In\nApril 2021, we announced our Low Cash Mode SM\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae feature which will give all\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae customers the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent\nor address overdrafts, and controls to choose\nwhether to return certain debits rather than\nthe bank making the decision. Through the end\nof July we have successfully rolled out Low\nCash Mode SM to 3.7 million Virtual Wallet \u00ae\ncustomers, 2.5 million of which were rolled\nout through the end of June. Since April,\nwe've delivered over 10 million Low Cash Mode\nSM alerts.\n\nUpon conversion, BBVA customers will be\neligible for the full suite of PNC products\nand services, including Low Cash Mode SM . Our\nfull year 2021 revenue outlook includes the\nimpact of fee reductions on both PNC legacy\nand the conversion of BBVA customers.\n\nSee the Executive Summary section in this\nFinancial Review for additional information on\nour business outlook.\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result have closed 95 legacy PNC\nbranches in the first six months of 2021\nconsistent with our plan.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 80% of consumer customers used\nnon-teller channels for the majority of their\ntransactions in the first six months of 2021\ncompared with 72% in 2020, in part reflecting\nconsumer transaction behavior changes during\nthe pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile\nchannels increased to 66% of total deposit\ntransactions in the first six months of 2021\nfrom 61% in 2020, in part reflecting consumer\ntransaction behavior changes during the\npandemic.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 15\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

Results for the first six\nmonths of 2021 include the impact of BBVA's\nbusiness operations for the month of June\n2021. Corporate & Institutional Banking added\n$30.6 billion in loans and $32.8 billion in\ndeposits at June 30, 2021 attributable to the\nacquisition.\n\nNet interest income, including $99 million\nfrom BBVA, increased in the comparison\nprimarily due to wider interest rate spreads\non the value of loans and higher average\ndeposit balances, partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on the value of deposits\nand lower average loan balances.\n\nGrowth in noninterest income, including $35\nmillion from BBVA, in the comparison reflected\nbroad-based increases in treasury management\nproduct revenue, capital markets-related\nrevenue and revenue from commercial mortgage\nbanking activities.\n\nProvision recapture in the first six months of\n2021 was driven by improvements in credit\nquality and macroeconomic factors, coupled\nwith lower loans outstanding, partially offset\nby the initial provision for credit losses of\n$462 million related to the BBVA acquisition.\n\nNonperforming assets at June 30, 2021\nincreased over the comparative period of 2020\nprimarily due to $763 million of nonperforming\nassets from BBVA.\n\nNoninterest expense, including $55 million\nfrom BBVA, increased in the comparison largely\ndue to higher variable costs associated with\nincreased business activity.\n\nAverage loans decreased compared with the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 due to declines in\nCorporate Banking and Business Credit,\npartially offset by increases in Commercial\nBanking and Real Estate:\n\n\u2022 Corporate Banking provides lending,\nequipment finance, treasury management and\ncapital markets-related products and services\nto mid-sized and large corporations, and\ngovernment and not-for-profit entities.\nAverage loans for this business declined\nreflecting lower average utilization of loan\ncommitments, partially offset by new\nproduction and loans from BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by marketable collateral.\nAverage loans for this business declined\nprimarily driven by lower average utilization\nof loan commitments, partially offset by new\nproduction and loans from BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets-\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business increased primarily driven by\nPPP loan originations and loans from BBVA,\npartially offset by softer new production and\nlower average utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting loans from\nBBVA, mostly offset by lower commercial\nmortgage and multifamily agency warehouse\nlending.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased in the\ncomparison reflecting customers maintaining\nliquidity due to the economic impacts of the\npandemic. We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nin response to evolving market conditions,\nbank funding needs and client relationship\ndynamics.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking continues to\nexpand its Corporate Banking business, focused\non the middle market and larger sectors. We\nexecuted on our expansion plans into the\nSeattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in\n2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated our\nexpansion efforts across the Southwest,\nhowever this has not changed our strategy\nregarding our de novo expansion efforts. This\nfollows offices opened in Boston and Phoenix\nin 2019, Denver, Houston and Nashville in\n2018, and Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis\nin 2017. These locations complement Corporate\n& Institutional Banking national businesses\nwith a significant presence in these cities\nand build on past successes in the markets\nwhere PNC\u2019s retail banking presence was\nlimited, such as in the Southeast. Our full\nsuite of commercial products and services is\noffered in these locations.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 17\n                                              \n  P                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  roduct Revenue                              \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital\nmarkets-related products and services and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, for\ncustomers of all business segments. On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome, corporate service fees and other\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses. The Other\nInformation section in Table 12 includes the\nconsolidated revenue to PNC for these\nservices. A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nWithin Treasury Management, PNC Global\nTransfers (formerly BBVA Transfer Services,\nInc.) provides wholesale money transfer\nprocessing capabilities throughout Mexico,\nCentral America, South America and the\nCaribbean. Treasury management revenue is\nreported in noninterest income and net\ninterest income. Noninterest income includes\ntreasury management product revenue less\nearnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services. Net interest income\nprimarily includes revenue from all treasury\nmanagement customer deposit balances. Compared\nwith the first six months of 2020, treasury\nmanagement revenue increased due to higher\ndeposit balances and higher noninterest\nincome, including $25 million from BBVA,\npartially offset by narrower interest rate\nspreads on the value of deposits.\n\nCapital markets-related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The increase in capital\nmarkets-related revenue in the comparison was\nprimarily driven by higher merger and\nacquisition advisory fees, revenue from credit\nvaluations on customer-related derivatives\nactivities and equity capital market advisory\nfees. These increases were partially offset by\nlower customer-related derivative fees.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income) and revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nrelated hedges. Total revenue from commercial\nmortgage banking activities increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to higher commercial\nmortgage servicing income.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Asset Management Group                      \n                                              \nAsset Management Group is focused on being a\npremier bank-held individual and institutional\nasset manager in each of the markets it\nserves.

same period in 2020 driven\nby higher revenue, lower noninterest expense\nand lower provision for credit losses. Results\nfor the first six months of 2021 include the\nimpact of BBVA's business operations for the\nmonth of June 2021. Asset Management Group\nadded $3.7 billion in loans and $8.7 billion\nin deposits at June 30, 2021 attributable to\nthe acquisition.\n\nNet interest income, including $21 million\nfrom BBVA, increased due to growth in average\nloan and deposit balances, wider interest rate\nspreads on loans and purchase accounting\nimpacts. This was partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on deposits.\n\nThe increase in noninterest income, including\n$6 million from BBVA, was primarily\nattributable to increases in the average\nequity markets.\n\nNoninterest expense, including $10 million\nfrom BBVA, declined due to intangible asset\namortization run-off and lower costs\nassociated with decreased business travel.\n\nProvision for credit losses in the first six\nmonths of 2021 was driven by an initial\nprovision for credit losses of $45 million\nrelated to the acquisition of BBVA, partially\noffset by improvements in credit quality and\nmacroeconomic factors.\n\nDiscretionary client assets under management,\nincluding $4.6 billion from BBVA, increased in\ncomparison to the prior year primarily due to\nthe higher equity markets as of June 30, 2021.\n\nThe Asset Management Group strives to be the\nleading relationship-based provider of\ninvestment, planning, banking and fiduciary\nservices to wealthy individuals and\ninstitutions by proactively delivering value-\nadded ideas, solutions and exceptional\nservice.\n\nWith the inclusion of BBVA, Personal Wealth\nManagement has approximately 100 offices\noperating in eight out of the ten most\naffluent states in the U.S. with a majority\nco-located with retail banking branches. The\nbusiness provides customized investments,\nplanning, trust and estate administration and\nprivate banking solutions to affluent\nindividuals and ultra-affluent families.\n\nInstitutional Asset Management provides\noutsourced chief investment officer, custody,\nprivate real estate, cash and fixed income\nclient solutions, and retirement plan\nfiduciary investment services to institutional\nclients including corporations, healthcare\nsystems, insurance companies, unions,\nmunicipalities and non-profits.\n\nWe expect that the BBVA acquisition will\ncontinue to allow meaningful opportunities to\ngrow the Asset Management Group segment by\nentering into new markets for both the\nPersonal Wealth Management and Institutional\nAsset Management businesses.\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ISK                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  M                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ANAGEMENT                                   \n                                              \nThe Risk Management section included in Item 7\nof our 2020 Form 10-K describes our enterprise\nrisk management framework including risk\nculture, enterprise strategy, risk governance\nand oversight framework, risk identification,\nrisk assessment, risk controls and monitoring,\nand risk aggregation and reporting.\nAdditionally, our 2020 Form 10-K provides an\nanalysis of the firm's Capital Management and\nour key areas of risk, which include but are\nnot limited to Credit, Market, Liquidity and\nOperational (including Compliance and\nInformation Security).\n\nUpon closing of the acquisition of BBVA, the\nPNC Enterprise Risk Management Framework\napplies to the legal entities acquired from\nBBVA S.A., including BBVA USA. Prior to\nclosing, PNC\u2019s Independent Risk Management\ngroup evaluated and updated the frameworks,\npolicies and procedures of the acquired BBVA\nentities as necessary. The updates were made\nto align the acquired BBVA entities with PNC\u2019s\nrisk appetite and connected the elements of\ntheir respective risk governance and reporting\ninto PNC\u2019s existing enterprise risk framework.\nConnecting the existing BBVA risk governance\nand reporting framework into PNC\u2019s existing\nenterprise risk framework allows separate risk\nprofiles, governance, and reporting for PNC\nBank and the acquired BBVA entities, during\nthe period from acquisition through\nconversion, while also providing the ability\nto consolidate into one enterprise risk\nprofile that will be communicated through the\nestablished risk governance and reporting for\nPNC. Upon the merger of BBVA USA into PNC\nBank, anticipated for October 2021, the\nupdated BBVA risk governance and reporting\nframework will no longer be applicable as all\nentities will be under PNC's framework.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk Management                      \n                                              \nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with contractual terms.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business and results from extending\ncredit to customers, purchasing securities,\nand entering into financial derivative\ntransactions and certain guarantee contracts.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant\nrisks.

Balances at June 30, 2021\ninclude BBVA contributions of $2.3 billion and\n$0.1 billion, respectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance of this\nportfolio monthly similarly to residential\nreal estate loans. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit, brokered\nhome equity lines of credit) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold the lien.\nThis information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nNewly originated loans over the last twelve\nmonths had a weighted-average LTV on\noriginations of 65% and a weighted-average\nFICO score of 782.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse an industry-leading third-party service\nprovider to obtain updated loan information,\nincluding lien and collateral data that is\naggregated from public and private sources.\n\nThe following table presents our home equity\nloans by geography and lien type:\n\nTable 18: Home Equity Loans by Geography and\nby Lien Type\n                                              \n           Ju\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           30,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  G\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  5,\u2026     21  %    $  5,\u2026     23  %  \n  N\u2026       3,\u2026     13          3,\u2026     14     \n  J\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       2,\u2026     10          2,\u2026     11     \n  F\u2026       1,\u2026      7          1,\u2026      6     \n  M\u2026       1,\u2026      5          1,\u2026      6     \n  I\u2026       1,\u2026      5          1,\u2026      6     \n  M\u2026       1,\u2026      5          1,\u2026      6     \n  T\u2026       1,\u2026      4            7            \n  N\u2026       977      4          1,\u2026      4     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  K\u2026       836      3          922      4     \n  O\u2026       5,\u2026     23          4,\u2026     20     \n  T\u2026                                          \n  h\u2026    $  25\u2026    100  %    $  24\u2026    100  %  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  t\u2026                                          \n  1\u2026               60  %               63  %  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026               40                  37     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026              100  %              100  %  \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at June 30, 2021.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $16.2 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.4 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of June 30, 2021.\nComparable amounts as of December 31, 2020\nwere $12.7 billion and $1.5 billion,\nrespectively.

Comparable amounts at December 31, 2020\nwere 47% and 41%, respectively. TDRs generally\nremain in nonperforming status until a\nborrower has made at least six consecutive\nmonths of both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms or ultimate\nresolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus and loans to borrowers not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Loans that have\nbeen restructured for COVID-19 related\nhardships and meet certain criteria under the\nCARES Act are not identified as TDRs.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in\nApril 2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the June\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 delinquency\nstatus of loans modified due to COVID-19\nrelated hardships aligns with the rules set\nforth for banks to report delinquency status\nto the credit agencies. These rules require\nthat COVID-19 related loan modifications be\nreported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the contractual\nterms of the loan, even where borrowers may\nnot be making payments on their loans during\nthe modification period. Loan modifications\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate or the principal balance of a\nloan do not qualify for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act or the interagency guidance.

TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that have been\nrestructured but that meet certain criteria\nunder the CARES Act are not categorized as\nTDRs.

We continued to see a reduction in\nthe number of customers in active assistance\nfrom the peak in the summer of 2020, which led\nto additional declines in loans under\nmodification that present credit risk to PNC\nat June 30, 2021.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe impact of these modifications was\nconsidered within the quarterly reserve\ndetermination. See the Allowance for Credit\nLosses discussion within the Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments section of\nthis Financial Review for additional\ninformation. Refer to the Loan Delinquencies\ndiscussion in this Credit Risk Management\nsection for information on how these hardship\nrelated loan modifications are reported from a\ndelinquency perspective as of June 30, 2021.\n\nUnder the CARES Act, loan modifications\nmeeting certain criteria qualify the loan for\nrelief from TDR treatment. Loans that do not\nmeet the criteria for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act may also be evaluated under\ninteragency guidance. For additional\ninformation on this criteria, see the Loan\nModifications discussion in the Credit Risk\nManagement section within Item 7 of our 2020\nForm 10-K.\n\nConsumer Loan Modifications Under Hardship\nRelief Programs\n\nOur consumer loan modification programs are\nbeing granted in response to customer\nhardships that extended beyond the initial\nrelief period. These loan and line\nmodifications include all hardship related\nmodifications. See the Loan Modifications\ndiscussion within Credit Risk Management in\nItem 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K for additional\ndetails.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\nconsumer accounts in active assistance under\nhardship relief programs that were on our\nbalance sheet at June 30, 2021. Excluded from\nTable 24 are government insured or guaranteed\nloans totaling $371 million and $282 million\nin the Residential real estate and Education\nloans classes, respectively.

detail in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement section of our 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nOne of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR\nis calculated by dividing the amount of an\ninstitution\u2019s HQLA, as calculated in\naccordance with the LCR rules, by its\nestimated, weighted net cash outflows, with\nnet cash outflows determined by applying the\nassumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The\nresulting quotient is expressed as a\npercentage. Effective January 1, 2020, PNC and\nPNC Bank, as Category III institutions under\nthe Tailoring Rules, were subject to a reduced\nLCR requirement, with each company's net\noutflows reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the\namount of HQLA each institution must hold to\nmeet the LCR minimum requirement. The minimum\nLCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to\nmaintain continues to be 100%. PNC and PNC\nBank calculate the LCR daily, and as of June\n30, 2021, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the requirement of 100%.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 31\nAdditionally, the acquisition of BBVA moved\nBBVA USA from a Category IV bank to a Category\nIII bank. Due to certain transition provisions\nin the LCR rules, as a Category III bank, BBVA\nUSA will not be subject to the LCR on a\nstandalone basis as it is anticipated to be\nmerged into PNC Bank prior to the effective\ndate for LCR compliance in 2022.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation and Recent Regulatory Developments\nsection of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk\nFactors of our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits increased to\n$452.9 billion at June 30, 2021 from $365.3\nbillion at December 31, 2020, driven by growth\nin both interest-bearing and noninterest-\nbearing deposits primarily due to $82.2\nbillion from the BBVA acquisition. See the\nFunding Sources portion of the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview for additional information related to\nour deposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt June 30, 2021, our liquid assets consisted\nof cash and due from banks and short-term\ninvestments (federal funds sold, resale\nagreements, trading securities and interest-\nearning deposits with banks) totaling $83.8\nbillion and securities available for sale\ntotaling $125.1 billion. The level of liquid\nassets fluctuates over time based on many\nfactors, including market conditions, loan and\ndeposit growth and balance sheet management\nactivities. Our liquid assets included $24.0\nbillion of securities available for sale and\ntrading securities pledged as collateral to\nsecure public and trust deposits, repurchase\nagreements and for other purposes. In\naddition, $0.1 billion of securities held to\nmaturity were also pledged as collateral for\nthese purposes.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings).

The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nJune 30, 2021, our unused secured borrowing\ncapacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve\nBank totaled $96.4 billion, of which $17.3\nbillion is from the BBVA acquisition.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of June 30, 2021,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing senior\nunsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains adequate liquidity to\nfund discretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nOn April 23, 2021, the parent company issued\n$1.0 billion of senior fixed-to-floating rate\nnotes with a maturity date of April 23, 2032.\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears\nat a fixed rate of 2.307% per annum, on April\n23 and October 23 of each year, beginning on\nOctober 23, 2021. Beginning on April 23, 2031,\ninterest is payable quarterly in arrears at a\nfloating rate per annum equal to\n\nCompounded SOFR (determined with respect to\neach quarterly interest period using the SOFR\nIndex), plus 0.97926%, on July 23, 2031,\nOctober 23, 2031, January 23, 2032 and at the\nmaturity date.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $4.5 billion. During the\nsecond quarter of 2021, PNC used approximately\n$11.5 billion of parent company cash to\nacquire BBVA. Parent company liquidity is\nprimarily held in intercompany cash.\nInvestments with longer durations may also be\nacquired, and if so, the related maturities\nare aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as\nthe maturity of parent company debt\nobligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends it receives from\nPNC Bank and BBVA USA, which may be impacted\nby the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws and regulations,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a bank to pay dividends or\nmake other capital distributions or to extend\ncredit to the parent company or its non-bank\nsubsidiaries. The amount available for\ndividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent\ncompany without prior regulatory approval was\napproximately $3.0 billion at June 30, 2021.\nSee Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K for a further discussion of these\nlimitations. Due to the net earnings\nrestrictions on dividend distributions under\nAlabama law, BBVA USA was not permitted to pay\ndividends at June 30, 2021 without regulatory\napproval.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank or BBVA\nUSA, other sources of parent company liquidity\ninclude cash and investments, as well as\ndividends and loan repayments from other\nsubsidiaries and dividends or distributions\nfrom equity investments. We can also generate\nliquidity for the parent company and PNC\u2019s\nnon-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of\ndebt and equity securities, including certain\ncapital instruments, in public or private\nmarkets and commercial paper. The parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of June 30, 2021,\nthere were no commercial paper issuances\noutstanding.\n\nThe parent company has an effective shelf\nregistration statement pursuant of which we\ncan issue debt, equity and other capital\ninstruments. See Note 16 Subsequent Events for\ninformation on the August 2021 redemption of\n$500 million of senior notes by the parent\ncompany.\n\nParent company senior and subordinated debt\noutstanding totaled $11.3 billion and $10.6\nbillion at June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 33\n                                              \n  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     \n                                              \nWe have contractual obligations representing\nrequired future payments on borrowed funds,\ntime deposits, leases, pension and\npostretirement benefits and purchase\nobligations.

Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our risk management policies,\nwhich are approved by management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the second quarter of 2021 and\n2020 follow:\n                                              \n  Table 31: Interest Sensitivity Analysis     \n                                              \n                                              \n                   Second           Second    \n                   Quarter          Quarter   \n                   2021             2020      \n                   (a)                        \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       5.2  %           3.2  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis      13.1  %          11.2  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  Key                                         \n  Period\u2026                                     \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Rates                                       \n  One-mo\u2026    0.10  %          0.16  %         \n  LIBOR                                       \n  Three-\u2026    0.15  %          0.30  %         \n  LIBOR                                       \n  Three-\u2026    0.57  %          0.23  %         \n  swap                                        \n                                              \n(a) Results include BBVA USA.\n\nIn addition to measuring the effect on net\ninterest income assuming parallel changes in\ncurrent interest rates, we routinely simulate\nthe effects of a number of nonparallel\ninterest rate environments.

We believe\nthat we have the deposit funding base and\nbalance sheet flexibility to adjust, where\nappropriate and permissible, to changing\ninterest rates and market conditions.\n\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors in our\n2020 Form 10-K, the planned discontinuance of\nthe requirement that banks submit rates for\nthe calculation of LIBOR after 2023 presents\nrisks to the financial instruments originated,\nheld or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a\nreference rate. PNC holds instruments and\nservices its instruments and instruments owned\nby others that may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC, like other\nfinancial participants, to financial, legal,\noperational, and reputational risks.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, PNC has established a cross-\nfunctional governance structure to oversee the\noverall strategy for the transition from LIBOR\nand mitigate risks associated with the\ntransition. An initial LIBOR impact and risk\nassessment has been performed, which\nidentified the associated risks across\nproducts, systems, models, and processes. PNC\nalso established an enterprise-level program,\nwhich is actively monitoring PNC\u2019s overall\nfirm-wide exposure to LIBOR and using these\nresults to plan transitional strategies and\ntrack progress versus these goals. Program\nworkstreams were formed by Line of Business to\nensure accountability and alignment with the\nappropriate operational, technology, and\ncustomer-facing stakeholders, while\nestablishing a centralized Program Management\nOffice to ensure consistency in execution and\ncommunication. Project plans and established\nmilestones have been developed and have\ncontinued to evolve and be refined in line\nwith industry developments and internal\ndecisions and progress. PNC is also involved\nin industry discussions, preparing milestones\nfor readiness and assessing progress against\nthose milestones, along with developing and\ndelivering on internal and external LIBOR\ncessation communication plans.\n\nKey efforts in 2020 and the first six months\nof 2021 included:\n\n\u2022 Enhancing fallback language in new contracts\nand reviewing existing legal\ncontracts/agreements to assess fallback\nlanguage impacts,\n\n\u2022 Making preparations for internal operational\nreadiness,\n\n\u2022 Making necessary enhancements to PNC's\ninfrastructure, including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes,\n\n\u2022 Developing and delivering on internal and\nexternal LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n\n\u2022 Engaging with PNC clients, industry working\ngroups and regulators, and\n\n\u2022 Monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments.\n\nPNC also has been an active participant in\nefforts with the Federal Reserve and other\nregulatory agencies to explore the potential\nneed for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to\nSOFR for use in commercial loans. Those\nefforts led to the formation of the Credit\nSensitivity Group, which has held a series of\nworkshops to assess how a credit-sensitive\nrate or add-on to SOFR might be constructed\nand discuss associated implementation issues.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 37\nIn late 2020, PNC began offering conforming\nadjustable rate mortgages using SOFR instead\nof USD LIBOR in line with Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac requirements. In the second\nquarter of 2021, PNC began offering\nnonconforming adjustable rate mortgages using\nSOFR and private student loans using Prime.\nPlans are in place to begin offering\nalternative rates to our corporate and\ncommercial customers in the third quarter of\n2021. PNC has provided regular updates to\nFederal Reserve, OCC and Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation examination staff\nregarding its LIBOR cessation and transition\nplans.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities.

The decrease was primarily due to\nlower interest rate derivative client sales\nrevenues partially offset by changes in the\ncredit valuation for customer-related\nderivatives activities. For the quarterly\nperiod, customer related trading revenue was\n$68 million for the second quarter of 2021\ncompared to $114 million in 2020. The decrease\nwas primarily due to lower customer-related\ntrading revenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets. In\naddition to extending credit, taking deposits,\nunderwriting securities and trading financial\ninstruments, we make and manage direct\ninvestments in a variety of transactions,\nincluding management buyouts,\nrecapitalizations and growth financings in a\nvariety of industries. We also have\ninvestments in affiliated and non-affiliated\nfunds that make similar investments in private\nequity. The economic and/or book value of\nthese investments and other assets are\ndirectly affected by changes in market\nfactors.\n\nVarious PNC business units manage our equity\nand other investment activities.

These tax\ncredit investment balances included unfunded\ncommitments totaling $1.8 billion and $1.4\nbillion at June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. These unfunded commitments are included\nin Other liabilities on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n\nNote 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K has further information on Tax\nCredit Investments.\n\nPrivate Equity and Other\n\nThe largest component of our other equity\ninvestments is our private equity portfolio.\nThe private equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.7\nbillion and $1.5 billion at June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively. As of June\n30, 2021, $1.5 billion was invested directly\nin a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was\ninvested indirectly through various private\nequity funds. See the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of our 2020 Form\n10-K for discussion of the potential impacts\nof the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank\non our interests in and other relationships\nwith private funds covered by the Volcker\nRule.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the June 30, 2021 per\nshare closing price of $233.82 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.3 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was not\nsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2020 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements. The estimated\nvalue does not represent fair value of the\nVisa B common shares given the share\u2019s limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $42 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 and were not\nsignificant for the six months ended June 30,\n2020.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional and an underlying as\nspecified in the contract. Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in our Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note\n12 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ECENT                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGULATORY                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVELOPMENTS                                 \n                                              \nBBVA Acquisition\n\nOn June 1, 2021, and following regulatory\napproval from the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nPNC acquired BBVA, a BHC registered under the\nBHC Act and a financial holding company under\nthe GLB Act, and its U.S. state member bank\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA, headquartered in\nBirmingham, Alabama. The regulatory approval\nprocess also included approvals from the\nbanking departments of the states of Alabama\nand Texas. BBVA USA is primarily regulated by\nthe Federal Reserve and the Alabama State\nBanking Department. BBVA USA, like PNC Bank,\nis also subject to regulation by the FDIC,\nwhich insures certain deposits of BBVA USA,\nand the CFPB, among other regulatory agencies.\n\nPNC also acquired certain nonbanking\nsubsidiaries of BBVA that are subject to\nregulation by various federal and state\nbodies, including state regulators of money\ntransfer and insurance entities. This includes\nBBVA Transfer Holdings, Inc. (now known as PNC\nPayment Holdings, Inc.), a company engaged in\nmoney transfer services and related\nactivities, including money transmission and\nforeign exchange services, through its two\nsubsidiaries, BBVA Transfer Services, Inc.\n(now known as PNC Global Transfers, Inc.) and\nBBVA Foreign Exchange, Inc. (now known as PNC\nGlobal Transfers FX, Inc.). PNC also acquired\nBBVA USA\u2019s subsidiaries, including BBVA Wealth\nSolutions, Inc. (now known as PNC Managed\nAccount Solutions, Inc.), an SEC-registered\ninvestment adviser, and BBVA Insurance Agency,\nInc. (now known as PNC Insurance Agency,\nInc.), a state-regulated insurance agency. PNC\nalso expects its broker-dealer subsidiary PNC\nInvestments to assume responsibility for\napproximately 100,000 retail brokerage\naccounts of the U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary\nof BBVA S.A., BBVA Securities, Inc.\n\nShortly after the acquisition, PNC merged BBVA\ninto PNC, and PNC contributed all of the\nshares of BBVA USA to PNC Bancorp, Inc, a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of PNC. As a result,\nBBVA USA is now a subsidiary of PNC Bancorp,\nInc. and an affiliate of PNC Bank. PNC expects\nto merge BBVA USA into PNC Bank in October\n2021. In addition, PNC Payment Holdings, Inc.,\nand its two subsidiaries are now nonbank\nsubsidiaries of PNC and affiliates of PNC Bank\nand BBVA USA.\n\nCapital, Capital Planning and Liquidity\n\nBBVA USA has been incorporated into PNC\u2019s\nconsolidated capital and liquidity metrics and\nreporting, capital planning, stress testing,\nand other regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, as a result of the acquisition\nof BBVA USA by PNC, a Category III banking\norganization under the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nEnhanced Prudential Standards, BBVA USA is now\na Category III bank. Subject to certain\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 39\ntransition provisions and any relief granted\nby the Federal Reserve, we expect BBVA USA to\nbe merged with PNC Bank prior to the LCR or\nNSFR becoming effective for BBVA USA.\n\nIn June 2021, the Federal Reserve announced\nthe results of its supervisory stress tests\nfor 2021. See the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection in this Item 2 for a discussion of\nPNC\u2019s results and capital actions. PNC\nremained well above its risk-based minimum\ncapital requirements in the supervisory stress\ntests, and as a result, will no longer be\nsubject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s temporary\nrestrictions on BHC dividends and share\nrepurchases that it put in place last year as\na result of ongoing uncertainty from COVID-19.\n\nOther Developments\n\nIn June 2021, the FDIC released a statement\noutlining its modified approach to\nimplementing its rule requiring insured\ndepository institutions like PNC Bank and BBVA\nUSA to submit resolution plans. These\nresolution plans must describe, among other\nthings, how the banks could be resolved in an\norderly and timely manner in the event of\nreceivership, and the failure to submit a\ncredible plan\n\ncould result in regulatory actions or\nrestrictions. The modified approach extends\nthe frequency of insured depository\ninstitution resolution plans to a three-year\ncycle, streamlines the content requirements,\nand places greater emphasis on continued\nengagement with firms. PNC Bank and BBVA USA\nexpect to receive additional information from\nthe FDIC detailing certain plan contents and\nthe due date for their next filings. PNC does\nnot expect BBVA USA to have to file a\nresolution plan before BBVA USA is merged into\n\nPNC Bank.\n\nOn July 31, 2021, the federal foreclosure\nmoratorium imposed by various federal agencies\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic expired.\nHowever, on July 30, 2021, the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency and the Federal Housing\nAdministration extended their eviction\nmoratoria through September 30, 2021. On\nAugust 3, 2021, the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention issued a revised\neviction moratorium applying to U.S. counties\nexperiencing substantial and high levels of\ncommunity transmission of COVID-19 through\nOctober 3, 2021. Around the same time, the\nCFPB finalized a set of Regulation X changes\nto provide foreclosure protections to\nborrowers as the emergency federal foreclosure\nprotections expire. The CFPB\u2019s final rule\ngenerally bars mortgage servicers like PNC\nBank and BBVA USA from filing new foreclosure\nfilings until December 31, 2021, unless\ncertain procedural safeguards are met or an\nexception applies; permits mortgage servicers\nto offer streamlined loan modification options\nto borrowers with COVID-19-related hardships\nbased on the evaluation of an incomplete\napplication; and makes temporary changes to\ncertain required servicer communications that\nborrowers receive regarding their options. The\nfinal rule is effective August 31, 2021.\n\nIn July 2021, the OCC announced it plans to\nrescind its June 2020 rule that significantly\naltered the regulations implementing the CRA\nfor national banks like PNC Bank. The OCC also\ndoes not plan to finalize its December 4, 2020\nproposed rule regarding performance metrics\nunder the June 2020 rule.\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form\n10-K describes the most significant accounting\npolicies that we use to prepare our\nconsolidated financial statements. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and fair value measurements\nare described in Critical Accounting Estimates\nand Judgments in Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.\nFor additional information on fair value\nmeasurements of assets and liabilities assumed\nin the BBVA acquisition, see Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Report. The following details\nthe critical estimates and judgments around\nthe ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases (including residual\nvalues), other financial assets and unfunded\nlending related commitments, for the remaining\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected\nprepayments. Our determination of the ACL is\nbased on historical loss experience, current\nborrower characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We use methods sensitive to\nchanges in economic conditions, to interpret\nthese factors to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate ACL on an\nongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to\nreflect in the ACL our best estimate of\namounts that we do not expect to collect\nbecause of, among other things, idiosyncratic\nrisk factors, changes in economic conditions\nthat may not be reflected in forecasted\nresults, or other potential methodology\nlimitations. The ACL estimates are therefore\nsusceptible to various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, the following major factors:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions and borrower\nquality: Our forecast of expected losses\ndepends on economic conditions and\n\nportfolio quality as of the estimation date.\nAs current economic conditions evolve,\nforecasted losses could be materially\n\naffected.\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Change to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios' weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe s cenarios used for the period ended June\n30, 2021 were designed to reflect an improved\nnear-term economic outlook in comparison to\nthe scenarios used for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020. This improvement was driven\nlargely by improvements in both the outlook\nfor consumer spending and the labor market due\nto the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act\nof 2021 and continued vaccine distribution. We\nused a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with the most significant drivers\nbeing Real GDP and unemployment rate measures.\nUsing the weighted-average of our four\neconomic forecast scenarios, we estimated\nthat:\n\n\u2022 Real GDP grows 6.1% in 2021, ending the year\n3.6% above pre-recession levels. Annual growth\ncontinues but slows to 2.9% and 2.2% in 2022\nand 2023, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Unemployment rates reflect continued\nrecovery in the labor market in 2021, with the\nunemployment rate falling to 5.6% by the end\nof the year. Employment gains were estimated\nto continue through the forecast period with\nthe unemployment rate reaching 4.7% and 4.1%\nby the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\nOne of the scenarios included in our weighted-\naverage is our baseline prediction of the most\nlikely economic outcome. This scenario\nincludes estimated Real GDP ending 2021 4.2%\nabove its pre-recession peak levels, with\nannual growth slowing to 2.9% and 2.0% in 2022\nand 2023, respectively, with unemployment\nrates expected to reach 5.0% by the end of\n2021, 4.2% by the end of 2022 and 3.8% by the\nend of 2023. See our Business Outlook and the\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation in this Financial Review for\nadditional discussion on our baseline\nprediction of the most likely economic\noutcome.\n\nThe economy has seen significant recovery from\nthe onset of the pandemic. National\nmacroeconomic indicators, forecasts and\nperformance expectations have all improved,\nhelping to lower overall loss expectations.\nThese improvements have been reflected in the\nreserve releases through the first half of\n2021. However, for certain portions of our\ncommercial and consumer portfolios\nconsiderable uncertainty remains regarding\nlifetime losses. For commercial borrowers,\nthere are still lingering concerns around\nindustries that have been affected by COVID-19\nrelated restrictions and emerging secular\nchanges. For these industries, where\nunrestricted commerce has recently returned,\nthe recovery will lag the broader economy.\nWhere restrictions persist and/or secular\nchanges have emerged, the impact and eventual\nlevel of recovery are less certain. For\nconsumer borrowers, payment behavior once the\ngovernment stimulus wanes is still difficult\nto predict. As such, for both our commercial\nand consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified\nand performed significant analysis around\nthese segments to ensure our reserves are\nadequate in the current economic environment.\nWe believe the economic scenarios have\neffectively provided sufficient variation to\ncapture probable recovery paths. Additionally,\nthrough in depth and granular analysis of\nCOVID-19 related impacts, we have adequately\naddressed reserve requirements for specific\npopulations most affected in the current\nenvironment. Through this approach we believe\nthe reserve levels sufficiently reflect the\nexpectation for life of loan losses of the\ncurrent portfolio.\n\nTo provide additional context regarding the\nsensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic\nforecast of expected economic outcomes, we\nconsidered what the ACL for the legacy PNC\nportfolio would be when applying a 100%\nprobability weighting to the most severely\nadverse of the four scenarios used in PNC's\nCECL framework. This severely adverse scenario\nestimated Real GDP growing 1.6% and ending\n2021 down 0.8% compared to pre-recession peak\nlevels, with year over year growth continuing\nthrough 2023, with the\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 41\nunemployment rate increasing to end 2021 at\n9.0% with the labor market showing improvement\nagain beginning in 2022. Excluding\nconsideration of qualitative adjustments, this\nsensitivity analysis would result in a\nhypothetical increase in our ACL of $2.2\nbillion at June 30, 2021. This scenario was\nnot our expectation at June 30, 2021 and does\nnot reflect our current expectation, nor does\nit capture all the potential unknown variables\nthat could arise, but it provides an\napproximation of a possible outcome under\nhypothetical severe conditions. The CECL\nmethodology inherently requires a high degree\nof judgment, and as a result, it is possible\nthat we may, at another point in time, reach\ndifferent conclusions regarding our credit\nloss estimates.\n\nSee the following for additional details on\nthe components of our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance For Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Financial\nReview, and\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Report.\n\nO FF -B ALANCE S HEET A RRANGEMENTS A ND V\nARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nWe engage in a variety of activities that\ninvolve entities that are not consolidated or\notherwise reflected in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that are generally referred to\nas off-balance sheet arrangements.

We will\ncontinue to evaluate the effectiveness of\ninternal controls over financial reporting as\nwe complete the integration of BBVA, including\nBBVA USA, with that of PNC and PNC Bank and\nwill make changes to our internal control\nframework, as necessary. The acquisition of\nBBVA contributed $95.7 of assets, or 17% of\nour total assets, at June 30, 2021 and $306\nmillion of revenue, or 7% of our total\nrevenue, for the three months ended June 30,\n2021 and 3% of our total revenue for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021.\n\n42 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time.

As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies\nof the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n\n\u2013 The length and extent of the economic\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n\u2013 The impact of the results of the recent U.S.\nelections on the regulatory landscape, capital\nmarkets, and the response to and management of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including the\neffectiveness of already-enacted fiscal\nstimulus from the federal government, a\npotential infrastructure bill and changes in\ntax laws, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour view that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2013 With passage of the American Rescue Plan Act\nof 2021 and continued vaccine distribution,\neconomic growth has picked up in 2021 and will\nremain very strong through the rest of this\nyear and into 2022. Real GDP returned to its\npre-pandemic level in the second quarter of\n2021. Employment in June 2021 was still down\nby 6.8 million from before the pandemic; PNC\nexpects employment to return to its pre-\npandemic level in the spring of 2022.\n\n\u2013 Compared to the spring of 2020 (when prices\nwere falling), inflation has accelerated in\nmid-2021 due to strong demand in specific\nsegments and supply chain disruptions.\nInflation will slow in the second half of\n2021.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25 %\nuntil mid-2023.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding a stress capital buffer established\nby the Federal Reserve Board in connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries.

As a result, the anticipated\nbenefits, including estimated cost savings, of\nthe transaction may be significantly more\ndifficult or take longer to achieve than\nexpected or may not be achieved in their\nentirety as a result of unexpected factors or\nevents, including those that are outside of\nour control.\n\n\u2013 The integration of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with that of PNC\nand PNC Bank may be more difficult to achieve\nthan anticipated or have unanticipated adverse\nresults relating to BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, or our existing\nbusinesses. Our ability to integrate BBVA,\nincluding its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA\nUSA, successfully may be adversely affected by\nthe fact that this transaction results in us\nentering several geographic markets where we\ndid not previously have any meaningful\npresence.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the BBVA transaction, we grow\nour business in part through acquisitions and\nnew strategic initiatives. Risks and\nuncertainties include those presented by the\nnature of the business acquired and strategic\ninitiative, including in some cases those\nassociated with our entry into new businesses\nor new geographic or other markets and risks\nresulting from our inexperience in those new\nareas, as well as risks and uncertainties\nrelated to the acquisition transactions\nthemselves, regulatory issues, and the\nintegration of the acquired businesses into\nPNC after closing.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures, security\nbreaches, cyberattacks or international\nhostilities through impacts on the economy and\nfinancial markets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2020 Form 10-K\nand first quarter 2021 Form 10-Q and elsewhere\nin this Report, including in the Risk Factors\nand Risk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

Our results for\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2021\nreflect BBVA's business operations for the\nmonth of June 2021 and our balance sheet at\nJune 30, 2021 includes BBVA's balances. See\nNote 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity\nfor additional information on this\nacquisition.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to\npresent fairly our results for the interim\nperiods. The results of operations for interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the full year\nor any other interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2020 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2020 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements. There have been no significant\nchanges to our accounting policies as\ndisclosed in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements, including for the\nBBVA acquisition. Actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates and the differences may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022                            \n                 Simplifies                   \n                 the                          \n                 accounting                   \n                 for income                   \n                 taxes by                     \n                 eliminating                  \n                 certain                      \n                 exceptions                   \n                 in ASC                       \n                 740,Income                   \n                 Taxes,                       \n                 relating to                  \n                 the                          \n                 approach                     \n                 for                          \n                 intraperiod                  \n                 tax                          \n                 allocation,    \u2022 Adopted     \n                 the            January 1,    \n                 recognition    2021.         \n                 of deferred    \u2022  The        \n                 tax            adoption of   \n                 liabilities    this          \n                 for outside    standard did  \n                 basis          not impact    \n                 differences    our           \n                 and the        consolidated  \n                 methodology    results of    \n                 for            operations    \n                 calculating    or our        \n                 income         consolidated  \n                 taxes in an    financial     \n  Income Tax     interim        position.     \n  Simplifica\u2026    period.

PNC did not acquire the\nfollowing entities as part of the acquisition:\nBBVA Securities, Inc., Propel Venture Partners\nFund I, L.P. and BBVA Processing Services,\nInc. This transaction has been accounted for\nas a business combination. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA were recorded\nat fair value as of the acquisition date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA are subject\nto adjustment for up to one year after the\nclosing date of the acquisition as additional\ninformation becomes available. Valuations\nsubject to adjustment include, but are not\nlimited to, loans, certain deposits, certain\nother assets, customer relationships and the\ncore deposit intangibles.\n\nPNC incurred $ 111million and $ 117million in\ncosts for the three and six months ended June\n30, 2021, in connection with the transaction.\nThese expenses are primarily comprised of\nlegal, advisory and technology related costs.\nCumulative nonrecurring merger and integration\ncosts through June 30, 2021 were $ 124million.\n\nThe following table includes the preliminary\nfair value of the identifiable tangible and\nintangible assets and liabilities from BBVA:\n\nTable 35: Acquisition Consideration\n                                              \n                                June 1, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In millions                     Fair Value  \n  Fair value of                               \n  acquisition                $        11,480  \n  consideration                               \n  Assets                                      \n  Cash and due from banks    $           969  \n  Interest-earning                    13,313  \n  deposits with banks                         \n  Loans held for sale                    446  \n  Investment securities\u00a0\u2013             18,358  \n  available for sale                          \n  Net loans                           61,370  \n  Equity investments                     723  \n  Mortgage servicing                      35  \n  rights                                      \n  Core deposit                                \n  intangibles and other                  399  \n  intangible                                  \n  assets                                      \n  Other                                3,531  \n  Total assets               $        99,144  \n  Liabilities                                 \n  Deposits                   $        85,562  \n  Borrowed funds                       2,449  \n  Accrued expenses and                 1,271  \n  other liabilities                           \n  Total liabilities          $        89,282  \n  Noncontrolling                          22  \n  interests                                   \n  Less: Net assets           $         9,840  \n  Goodwill                   $         1,640  \n                                              \nPreliminary goodwill of $ 1.6billion recorded\nin connection with the transaction resulted\nfrom the reputation, operating model and\nexpertise of BBVA.

The prices are adjusted as\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain loans that are priced based on the\npricing of similar loans.\n\nPersonal installment loans are pooled based on\ndelinquency status, and fair value of\nindividual loans is calculated based on traded\nconsumer unsecured loans, dealer research and\nloan level performance characteristics.\n\nAvailable For Sale Securities\n\nAll investment securities from the BBVA\nacquisition were classified within the\navailable for sale portfolio at acquisition.\nFair value estimates for available for sale\nsecurities were determined by third-party\npricing vendors. The third-party vendors use a\nvariety of methods when pricing securities\nthat incorporate relevant market data to\narrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the\nmarketplace would pay for a security under\ncurrent market conditions. These methods\ninclude the use of quoted prices for the\nidentical or a similar security, an\nalternative market-based approach or an income\napproach, such as a discounted cash flow\npricing model.\n\nLoans\n\nFair value for loans is based on a discounted\ncash flow methodology that considered credit\nloss and prepayment expectations, market\ninterest rates and other market factors, such\nas liquidity, from the perspective of a market\nparticipant. Loan cash flows were generated on\nan individual loan basis. The PD, LGD,\nexposure at default and prepayment assumptions\nare the key factors driving credit losses\nwhich are embedded into the estimated cash\nflows.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 53\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments primarily include LIHTC\ninvestments and preservation fund investments.\nThe fair value of the LIHTC investments was\nestimated based on LIHTC pricing observed for\nrecent transactions in markets where the\nproperties underlying the LIHTC investments\nfrom the BBVA acquisition are located. The\nfair value of the preservation investments was\nestimated based on appraisals and valuations\nof the properties in the investment portfolio\nusing income and market projections.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe fair value of mortgage servicing rights\nfrom the BBVA acquisition is estimated by\nusing a discounted cash flow valuation model\nwhich calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows,\ntaking into consideration actual and expected\nmortgage loan prepayment rates, discount\nrates, servicing costs and other factors which\nare determined based on current market\nconditions.\n\nCore Deposit Intangible\n\nThis intangible asset represents the value of\ncertain client deposit relationships. The fair\nvalue was estimated utilizing the cost method.\nAppropriate consideration was given to deposit\ncosts including servicing costs, client\nretention and alternative funding source costs\nat the time of acquisition. The discount rate\nused was derived taking into account the\nestimated cost of equity, risk-free return\nrate and risk premium for the market and\nspecific risk related to the asset\u2019s cash\nflows. The core deposit intangible is being\namortized over 10years using an accelerated\ndepreciation methodology.\n\nDeposits\n\nThe fair values for time deposits were\nestimated by discounting contractual cash\nflows using current market rates for\ninstruments with similar maturities. For\ndeposits with no defined maturity, carrying\nvalues approximate fair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nThe fair values of long-term debt instruments\nwere estimated based on quoted market prices.\nThe following table presents financial results\nof BBVA included in the Consolidated Statement\nof Income from the date of acquisition through\nJune 30, 2021.\nTable 38: BBVA Financial Results\n                                              \n                             One month ended  \n  In millions                  June 30, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net interest         $                 236  \n  income                                      \n  Noninterest          $                  80  \n  income                                      \n  Net income           $                 153  \n                                              \nThe following table presents unaudited pro\nforma results as if the acquisition of BBVA by\nPNC had occurred on January 1, 2020 and\nincludes the impact of amortizing and\naccreting certain estimated purchase\naccounting adjustments such as intangible\nassets as well as fair value adjustments to\nloans, deposits and long-term debt.\nAcquisition costs of $ 117million that have\nbeen incurred since January 1, 2021 are\nincluded in the pro forma results.

PNC initially measures the\namortized cost of a PCD loan by adding the\nacquisition date estimate of expected credit\nlosses to the loan's purchase price. The\ninitial ACL for PCD loans of $ 1.2billion was\nestablished through an adjustment to the BBVA\nloan balance and related purchase accounting\nmark. Non-PCD loans and PCD loans had a fair\nvalue of $ 52.1billion and $ 9.3billion at the\nacquisition date and unpaid principal balance\nof $ 52.0billion and $ 10.3billion,\nrespectively. In accordance with U.S. GAAP,\nthere was no carryover of the ACL that had\nbeen previously recorded by BBVA. Subsequent\nto acquisition, PNC recorded an ACL on non-PCD\nloans of $ 1.0billion through an increase to\nthe provision for credit losses.\nTable 40: PCD Loan Activity\n                                         \n                           June 1, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In millions                            \n  Principal Balance     $        10,253  \n  ACL at acquisition             -1,161  \n  Non-credit premium                224  \n  Purchase price        $         9,316  \n                                         \nSale of Equity Investment in BlackRock, Inc.\n\nIn May 2020, PNC completed the sale of its\n31.6million shares of BlackRock, Inc. common\nand preferred stock through a registered\nsecondary offering at a price of $ 420per\nshare. In addition, BlackRock repurchased\n2.65million shares from PNC at a price of $\n414.96per share. The total proceeds from the\nsale were $ 14.2billion in cash, net of $\n0.2billion in expenses, and resulted in a gain\non sale of $ 4.3billion. Additionally, PNC\ncontributed 500,000BlackRock shares to the PNC\nFoundation.\n\nFollowing the sale and donation, PNC has\ndivested its entire investment in BlackRock\nand only holds shares of

December 31, 2020, respectively. These\namounts are included in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 105million and $ 79million for\nsecurities available for sale at June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(c) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. 84% and 85% of our securities\nheld to maturity were rated AAA/AA at June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Shareholders\u2019 equity as\nAOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at both June 30, 2021\nand June 30, 2020 included $ 0.3billion of net\nunsettled purchases which represent non-cash\ninvesting activity, and accordingly, are not\nreflected on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date based\non estimation of expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. As of June 30, 2021, the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 108million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The provision for credit\nlosses on investment securities was zeroand $\n26million for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2021. See Note 1 Accounting Policies\nincluded in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the methodologies used to\ndetermine the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nTable 44 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020. These securities are\nsegregated between investments that had been\nin a continuous unrealized loss position for\nless than twelve months and twelve months or\nmore, based on the point in time that the fair\nvalue declined below the amortized cost basis.\nAll securities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of June\n30, 2021, we concluded that we do not intend\nto sell and believe we will not be required to\nsell these securities prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis.\n\n56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nTable 44: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nInformation relating to gross realized\nsecurities gains and losses from the sales of\nsecurities is set forth in the following\ntable:\nTable 45: Gains (Losses) on Sales of\nSecurities Available for Sale\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           G\u2026         G\u2026         \u2026     T\u2026  \n  \u2026           G\u2026         L\u2026         \u2026     E\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  2\u2026      $  -\u2026      $  35     $   7  \n  \u2026    $  2\u2026      $  -2      $  2\u2026     $  47  \n                                              \n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 57\nThe following table presents, by remaining\ncontractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair\nvalue and weighted-average yield of debt\nsecurities at June 30, 2021:\nTable 46: Contractual Maturity of Debt\nSecurities\n                                              \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                  %      \u2026    \n                                              \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                  %      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Weighted-average yields are based on\namortized cost with effective yields weighted\nfor the contractual maturity of each security.\nAt June 30, 2021, there were no securities of\na single issuer, other than FNMA and FHLMC,\nthat exceeded 10% of total shareholders\u2019\nequity.

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 48 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nJune 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Pursuant\nto the interagency guidance issued in April\n2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the\ndelinquency status of loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships aligns with the\nrules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the contractual\nterms of the loan, even where borrowers may\nnot be making payments on their loans during\nthe modification period. Loan modifications\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate or the principal balance of a\nloan do not qualify for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act or the interagency guidance.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 59\nTable 48: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) (b)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table represent loans held for\ninvestment and do not include any associated\nvaluation allowance.\n(b) The accrued interest associated with our\nloan portfolio totaled $ 0.8billion and $\n0.7billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively.

This increase was primarily\nattributable to the addition of reserves\nrelated to the BBVA acquisition, partially\noffset by portfolio changes and an improved\neconomic outlook. The following summarizes the\nchanges in these factors that influenced the\ncurrent ACL:\n\n\u2022 We acquired BBVA on June 1, 2021. The\ninitial provision for credit losses related to\nthis acquisition along with the impact of fair\nvalue purchase accounting was incorporated\ninto reserves in the current period.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio changes that drove reserve\ndeclines at June 30, 2021 reflected\nimprovements in credit quality along with\ndecreases in loan balances across our legacy\nportfolio due to lower utilization of loan\ncommitments by commercial customers and\npaydowns in the consumer portfolio.\n\n\u2022 The economic scenarios used for the period\nended June 30, 2021 were designed to reflect\nan improved near-term economic outlook in\ncomparison to the scenarios used for the\nperiod ended December 31, 2020. This\nimprovement was driven largely by improvements\nin both the outlook for consumer spending and\nthe labor market due to the passage of the\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and continued\nvaccine distribution.\n\n68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nN OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nAs more fully described in Note 5 Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities and Variable Interest\nEntities in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we\nhave transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement.

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 59\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is not significant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE. In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 59.

See Note 2 Acquisition and\nDivestiture Activities for additional\ninformation.\n\nWe review goodwill in each of our reporting\nunits for impairment at least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events\noccur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date. Based\non the results of our analysis, there were\nnoimpairment charges related to goodwill in\nthe first six months of 2021 or in 2020.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nWe recognize the right to service mortgage\nloans for others as an intangible asset when\nthe servicing income we receive is more than\nour projected servicing costs. MSRs are\npurchased or originated when loans are sold\nwith servicing retained. MSRs totaled $\n1.8billion and $ 1.2billion at June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively, and\nconsisted of loan servicing contracts for\ncommercial and residential mortgages measured\nat fair value.\n\nMSRs are subject to declines in value from\nactual or expected prepayment of the\nunderlying loans and defaults, as well as\nmarket driven changes in interest rates. We\nmanage this risk by economically hedging the\nfair value of MSRs with securities and\nderivative instruments which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 6 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs. See Note 15 Fair Value\nand Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of our 2020 Form\n10-K for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement and our accounting of MSRs.\nChanges in the commercial and residential MSRs\nfollow:\nTable 61: Mortgage Servicing Rights\n                                              \n         \u2026                   R\u2026               \n         \u2026  \u2026        \u2026       M\u2026  \u2026         \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  6\u2026     $  9\u2026     \n                                              \n                             35               \n         \u2026        \u2026          37        22     \n         \u2026        \u2026          3\u2026        61     \n                                              \n         \u2026        \u2026          -\u2026        -\u2026     \n         \u2026        \u2026          1\u2026        -\u2026     \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  1\u2026     $  5\u2026     \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  1\u2026     $  1\u2026     \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  1\u2026     $  92     \n                                              \n(a) Represents decrease in MSR value due to\npassage of time, including the impact from\nboth regularly scheduled loan principal\npayments and loans that were paid down or paid\noff during the period.\n(b) Represents MSR value changes resulting\nprimarily from market-driven changes in\ninterest rates.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 71\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nThe fair value of commercial and residential\nMSRs and significant inputs to the valuation\nmodels as of June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020 are shown in Tables 62 and 63.

These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 62 and 63. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions.\n\nTable 62: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow June 30, 2021, we\nexpect to reclassify net derivative gains of $\n330million pretax, or $ 254million after-tax,\nfrom AOCI to interest income for these cash\nflow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations, and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to June 30, 2021. As\nof June 30, 2021, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail regarding

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting, counterparty credit risk and\ncontingent features, see Note 16 Financial\nDerivatives in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of our\n2020 Form 10-K.\n\nTable 82 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nas of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The\ntable includes cash collateral held or pledged\nunder legally enforceable master netting\nagreements. The table also includes the fair\nvalue of any securities collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Cash and securities\ncollateral amounts are included in the table\nonly to the extent of the related net\nderivative fair values.\n\nTable 82 includes OTC derivatives and OTC\nderivatives cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. OTC derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties that\nare not settled through an organized exchange\nor directly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house who then becomes our\ncounterparty.

Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our\n2020 Form 10-K and in Note 13 Legal\nProceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our first\nquarter 2021 Form 10-Q (such prior disclosure\nreferred to as \u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For\nDisclosed Matters where we are able to\nestimate such possible losses or ranges of\npossible losses, as of June 30, 2021, we\nestimate that it is reasonably possible that\nwe could incur losses in excess of related\naccrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate\namount less than $ 100million. The estimates\nincluded in this amount are based on our\nanalysis of currently available information\nand are subject to significant judgment and a\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties. As\nnew information is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item\n8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we are unable, at\nthis time, to estimate the losses that are\nreasonably possible to be incurred or ranges\nof such losses with respect to some of the\nmatters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated\namount provided above does not include an\nestimate for every Disclosed Matter.\nTherefore, as the estimated aggregate amount\ndisclosed above does not include all of the\nDisclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above\ndoes not represent our maximum reasonably\npossible loss exposure for all of the\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn June 2021, in United Services Automobile\nAssociation v.

Average\nbalances of securities are based on amortized\nhistorical cost (excluding adjustments to fair\nvalue, which are included in other assets).\nAverage balances for certain loans and\nborrowed funds accounted for at fair value are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes\nin fair value recorded in Noninterest income.\n\n(b) Loan fees for the three months ended June\n30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 were $42 million\nand $35 million, respectively.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of\n\ncommon stock repurchases depending on a number\nof factors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative\n\nuses of capital, the potential impact on our\ncredit ratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy\n\nand capital planning processes undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR\nprocess. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a\ntemporary suspension of our common stock\nrepurchase program in conjunction with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s effort to support the U.S.\neconomy during the pandemic. We continued the\nsuspension through the second quarter of 2021,\nwith the exception of employee benefit-related\npurchases in the third quarter of 2020,\nconsistent with extension of the Federal\nReserves's special capital distribution\nrestrictions. During the second quarter of\n2021, PNC announced the reinstatement of share\nrepurchase programs with repurchases of up to\n$2.9 billion for the four-quarter period\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                      10-Q 103\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 6.
