The past year has    \nbeen one of growth and progress for PNC.      \nFollowing the successful acquisition and      \nconversion of BBVA USA in 2021, PNC began 2022\nwith BBVA USA fully integrated, allowing the  \ncompany to leverage its capabilities and      \ndelivery model in new and expanding markets. I\nwould be remiss if I did not acknowledge and  \nthank PNC\u2019s 61,000-plusemployees for their    \nincredible efforts and dedication throughout  \nthe year, which made this all possible. The   \nboard views PNC\u2019s success in 2022 as a        \nreflection of the power of the national Main  \nStreet bank model, and of the company\u2019s       \nunwavering commitment to doing the right thing\nfor all stakeholders. That formula has helped \ndifferentiate PNC in the marketplace, deepen  \nrelationships with clients, attract top       \ntalent, and deliver solid financial returns   \nfor you, our shareholders. Chaired by Bill    \nDemchak, the board works diligently to oversee\nthe development and execution of the company\u2019s\nstrategy, and to ensure management decisions  \nalign to that strategy. We do that through    \nregular engagement with company leadership and\nparticipation on board committees focused on  \nAudit, Nominating and Governance, Human       \nResources, Risk, Technology, and Equity &     \nInclusion; and on a subcommittee focused on   \nCompliance. As you will read throughout this  \nproxy statement, the board and company        \nmanagement are firmly committed to sound      \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG)    \npractices that help us compete effectively and\ngenerate long-term value for all our          \nconstituents. To that end, each board         \ncommittee maintains specific oversight        \nresponsibility for the company\u2019s ESG efforts  \npertinent to that committee\u2019s area of focus.  \nThe board believes it is most effective when  \nit represents diverse perspectives. Our       \nindependent directors come from a wide range  \nof backgrounds, and each director brings      \nunique ideas and experiences that are highly  \nvaluable to the board and its ability to      \nprovide strategic guidance and oversight. Of  \nthe 12 independent directors nominated for    \nelection this year, half are women or people  \nof color. In May 2022, we were pleased to     \nwelcome Renu Khator, Ph.D., chancellor of the \nUniversity of Houston System and president of \nthe University of Houston, to our board as the\nnewest independent director. Renu brings a    \nwealth of expertise in leadership, economic   \ndevelopment, and community engagement. We are \ngrateful for her insight. The board extends   \nits gratitude to Michael Ward, whose dedicated\nservice as a director comes to a close upon   \nhis retirement this year. Mike was truly an   \nasset to the board and he will be missed. As a\nboard, we are encouraged by PNC\u2019s progress in \n2022. We believe the company\u2019s strong         \nfoundation and strategic direction position it\nfor continued success in 2023 and beyond.     \nThank you once again for your support.        \n                              \n  March\u00a015, 2023  Sincerely,  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                              \nAndrew Feldstein Presiding Director           \n                                              \nPARTICIPATE IN THE FUTURE OF PNC \u2014 PLEASE CAST\nYOUR VOTE Your vote is important to us, and we\nwant your shares to be represented at the     \nannual meeting.

Our Bylaws         \ncontemplate a range in the size of the Board  \nfrom five to 25 directors. For the annual     \nmeeting, the Board fixed the number of        \ndirectors to be elected at 13.                \n                                              \nOn May 10, 2022, the Board appointed Renu     \nKhator to serve as a director. Dr. Khator was \ninitially identified as a director candidate  \nby a search firm retained by the Nominating   \nand Governance Committee. Dr. Khator was      \nreviewed by the search firm for inclusion in  \nthe pool of potential director candidates, and\nappointed to the Board following the          \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation and nomination.        \n                                              \nEach of the 13 nominees currently serves on   \nthe Board, and consents to being named in this\nproxy statement and to serve if elected. The  \nBoard has no reason to believe that any       \nnominee will be unavailable or unable to serve\nas a director. Each director elected at the   \nannual meeting will serve for one year, until \nthe next annual meeting of our shareholders   \nand the election and qualification of his or  \nher successor, or until his or her earlier    \nresignation or removal from the Board. We do  \nnot stagger our elections; the entire Board   \nwill be considered for election at the annual \nmeeting.                                      \n                                              \nThe following graphic highlights the skills,  \nexperience and demographics of the Board as   \ncomprised of the 13 director nominees.        \n                                              \nWe recognize the value of a Board that is     \ndiverse in perspective and experience.

As part of its continuing efforts  \nto provide for director succession and strong \nBoard composition in light of the anticipated \nretirement of Mr. Ward, on May 10, 2022 the   \nBoard appointed Renu Khator to serve as a     \ndirector upon the recommendation of the       \nNominating and Governance Committee. Ms.      \nKhator is included as a nominee for election  \nto the Board at the annual meeting.

Any  \nchanges recommended by the Committee are      \nreviewed and approved by the Board. Our Board \nleadership structure Based on an assessment of\nits current needs and composition, as well as \nthe skills and qualifications of the          \ndirectors, the Board believes that the        \nappropriate Board leadership structure should \ninclude the following attributes:             \n                                              \n  \u2022    A substantial majority (at least two   \n       thirds) of independent directors       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    A Presiding Director who serves as     \n       the lead independent director          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Regular executive sessions of all      \n  \u2022    independent directors without          \n       management present                     \n                                              \nThe current leadership structure of the Board \nincludes all three attributes. The Board      \nrecognizes that one of its key                \nresponsibilities is to periodically evaluate  \nthe optimal leadership structure to ensure    \nrobust independent oversight of management and\nan engaged and effective board with           \ncomplementary qualities, perspectives and     \nexperiences. The Board believes the Board     \nleadership structure should be flexible enough\nto accommodate different circumstances. As    \nsuch, the Board periodically reviews its      \nleadership structure and may choose a         \ndifferent leadership structure if             \ncircumstances should arise that lead the Board\nto believe that a different Board leadership  \nstructure would promote the long-term         \ninterests of our shareholders. Our governing  \ndocuments permit the roles of Chair and CEO to\nbe filled by the same or different            \nindividuals, and the Board has not adopted a  \npolicy with respect to the separation of the  \nChair and CEO positions. To ensure robust     \nindependent leadership on the Board, our      \ncorporate governance guidelines provide that  \nthe Board shall appoint a Presiding Director, \nwho shall also serve as the chair of the      \nNominating and Governance Committee. The Board\nconsiders its leadership structure each year  \nand discusses whether to separate the Chair   \nand CEO positions as necessary or appropriate,\nin its judgment, including but not limited to \nwhen selecting a new CEO. In making this      \ndecision, the Board considers a range of      \nfactors, including: the people currently in   \nthe roles of CEO, Chair and Presiding Director\nand their record of leadership and performance\nin their roles; the current composition of the\nBoard; PNC\u2019s operating and financial          \nperformance; any recent or anticipated changes\nin the CEO role; the effectiveness of the     \nprocesses and structures for Board interaction\nwith and oversight of management; and the     \nimportance of maintaining a single voice in   \nleadership communications and Board oversight,\nboth internally and with shareholders and     \nother stakeholders. The Board believes the    \ninterests of our shareholders are best served \nat this time through the current combined     \nChair and CEO leadership structure, supported \nby a Presiding Director who has oversight     \nresponsibilities. This structure provides the \nappropriate balance between a Chair and CEO   \nwith responsibilities for day-to-             \ndaymanagement, Board leadership and setting   \nlong-term strategy, and an empowered          \nindependent Presiding Director with well-     \ndefined responsibilities, including           \nfacilitating, among other things, the Board\u2019s \nindependent oversight of management, CEO      \nreview, promoting communication between senior\nmanagement and the Board about issues such as \nmanagement development and succession         \nplanning, executive compensation and company  \nperformance, and engaging and communicating   \nwith shareholders and other stakeholders as   \nappropriate. William S. Demchak, our current  \nCEO, also serves as Chair of the Board. Andrew\nT. Feldstein, the chair of the Nominating and \nGovernance Committee, currently serves as     \nPresiding Director. We describe the           \nresponsibilities of the Presiding Director in \nmore detail below. Mr. Feldstein also serves  \nas a member of the Risk Committee, where he   \nleverages his expertise in identifying,       \nassessing and managing credit, market and     \nother risks to assist the Committee in        \nperforming its risk oversight function.       \nSubstantial majority of independent           \ndirectors.We have long maintained a Board with\na substantial majority of directors who are   \nnot PNC employees and who otherwise qualify as\nindependent under the rules of the New York   \nStock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). The NYSE requires\nat least a majority of our directors be       \nindependent from management. Mr. Demchak is   \nthe only director who is not independent under\nthe NYSE\u2019s \u201cbright-line\u201d tests for            \nindependence because he is our CEO. The Board \nhas affirmed the independence of each of the  \nother 12 nominees for director.

In between meetings, each   \ndirector is encouraged to raise any topics or \nissues with the Presiding Director that the   \ndirector believes should be discussed in      \nexecutive session. As chair of the Nominating \nand Governance Committee, the Presiding       \nDirector leads the Board and committee annual \nself-evaluation process and the evaluation of \nthe independence of directors. These          \nresponsibilities include identifying and      \nevaluating individuals qualified to become    \ndirectors, consistent with Board-approved     \ncriteria, and recommending to the Board such  \nchanges in the Board\u2019s composition, design and\nstructure as the Committee may deem           \nappropriate. The Nominating and Governance    \nCommittee also reviews, and the Presiding     \nDirector as chair of the Committee reports to \nthe Board on, significant developments in     \ncorporate governance. Regular executive       \nsessions of independent directors.Our         \nindependent directors have met and will       \ncontinue to meet in regularly scheduled       \nexecutive sessions without management present.\nThe NYSE requires our independent directors to\nmeet in executive session at least once a     \nyear. Under the Board\u2019s own policy, our       \nindependent directors meet in executive       \nsession at least quarterly. The Presiding     \nDirector leads these executive sessions.      \nBoard\u2019s role in risk oversight The Risk       \nCommittee of the Board (together with the     \nCompliance Subcommittee of the Risk Committee)\noversees and approves the enterprise-wide risk\ngovernance framework (the \u201cERM Framework\u201d) and\noversees the processes established to         \nidentify, assess, monitor and report the      \ncompany\u2019s risks. Management-level risk        \ncommittees are in place to help ensure the    \nrisk expectations defined by our ERM Framework\nare followed and that business decisions are  \nmade and executed consistent with the Board\u2019s \ndesired risk profile. The Enterprise Risk     \nManagement Committee, chaired by the Chief    \nRisk Officer, is responsible for oversight of \nrisk management through, among other          \nactivities, the review of the Enterprise Risk \nProfile and the discussion of key risk trends \nand issues. At PNC, we manage the company for \nthe long term and our ERM Framework and risk  \nappetite consider the longer-term strategic   \nrisks that face the company. However, a       \nsignificant focus is applied to those risks,  \nsuch as credit, operational, liquidity and    \ninformation security risks, that may have a   \nmaterial impact in the short or medium term.  \nIndependent risk reporting and escalation     \npractices provide the Risk Committee (and the \nCompliance Subcommittee) the opportunity to   \nunderstand significant risks the organization \nfaces, understand how those risks affect our  \nrisk profile and risk appetite, and provide   \nfeedback on management\u2019s plans to manage in   \nthe company alignment with PNC\u2019s risk         \nappetite. Additionally, this transparency     \nsupports decision making by the Risk          \nCommittee. The Chief Risk Officer and PNC\u2019s   \nChief Compliance Officer, who reports to the  \nChief Risk Officer, provide regular reports to\nthe Risk Committee (or the Compliance         \nSubcommittee, as applicable) regarding the    \ncompany\u2019s risk profile, significant existing, \nnew or emerging risks, and significant        \ninitiatives to identify, manage and control   \nsuch risks. PNC\u2019s ability to report on        \nsignificant new, emerging or existing risks   \nthrough the risk reporting framework and      \ncommittee governance structure allows the Risk\nCommittee to engage in an active dialogue with\nexecutive leadership on those risks, provide  \nperspective on the effect of the risk to the  \ncompany\u2019s risk profile and provide feedback on\nmanagement\u2019s plans to manage the company in   \nalignment with PNC\u2019s risk appetite. PNC\u2019s     \ndisclosure controls and procedures outline the\nresponsibilities of the Chief Risk Officer,   \nthe Independent Risk Management organization  \nand other units within PNC with respect to    \nfinancial disclosures. These responsibilities \ndirectly align with the ERM Framework and the \nERM Framework policy, which is overseen and   \napproved by the Risk Committee.               \n                                              \n  20    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE PNC\u2019s governance         \nstructure, risk reporting framework, and      \ncommunication and escalation practices allow  \nfor Independent Risk Management to escalate   \nsignificant new, emerging and existing risks  \nthat, if left unmitigated, could push PNC     \noutside of our risk appetite or disrupt our   \nability to achieve our business objectives.   \nIndependent Risk Management regularly engages \nexternal parties, both formally and           \ninformally, to help ensure future threats and \ntrends are identified and considered in our   \nongoing risk identification, assessment,      \nmonitoring and reporting frameworks.          \nEngagements with external parties include     \nmemberships in industry trade groups,         \nconsultations with industry experts and formal\nengagements with independent consultants. As  \nnew or emerging risks are identified, PNC     \nevaluates the comprehensiveness of our        \nexisting ERM Framework to identify assess,    \nmonitor and control those risks.

The Audit Committee must  \napprove any waivers of or exceptions to code  \nprovisions granted to our directors or        \nexecutive officers. We will post on our       \nwebsite any future amendments to, or waivers  \nfrom, a provision of the Code of Business     \nConduct and Ethics that applies to any of our \ndirectors or executive officers (including our\nChair and CEO, CFO and Controller). PNC has   \nalso adopted, and the Audit Committee has     \napproved, Ethics Guidelines for Directors to  \nsupplement the Code of Business Conduct and   \nEthics. Orientation and education All of our  \nnew directors undergo a director orientation  \nprogram. In addition to written materials     \nprovided to new directors, personalized       \norientation sessions are held with each new   \ndirector. These personalized orientation      \nsessions generally include meetings with      \nsenior management to familiarize new directors\nwith our strategic plans, significant         \nfinancial, accounting and risk management     \nissues, capital markets activities, compliance\nprograms, the Code of Business Conduct and    \nEthics and related policies, our principal    \nofficers, and our internal and independent    \nauditors, as well as specified matters related\nto the Board committees or subcommittees to   \nwhich the new director has been appointed. We \nalso provide a continuing education program   \nfor our directors that considers their        \nknowledge and experience and our risk profile,\nand includes training on complex products and \nservices, our lines of business, significant  \nrisks to the company, applicable laws,        \nregulations and supervisory requirements, and \nother relevant topics identified by the Board \nand management. The continuing education      \nprogram is provided through a combination of  \npersonalized sessions and coordination of     \nattendance by directors at outside seminars,  \nincluding those offered by regulators,        \nrelevant to the duties of a director. Certain \ntraining sessions may be held in connection   \nwith, or as part of, a meeting of the Board or\na Board committee. Board committees The Board \ncurrently has five standing committees. The   \nfour primary committees\u2014Audit, Nominating and \nGovernance, Human Resources, and Risk\u2014meet on \na regular basis. The Executive Committee,     \nwhich is composed of our CEO and the chairs of\nthe four primary committees, meets as needed. \nThe Executive Committee may act on behalf of  \nthe Board and would report to the full Board  \nfollowing any action taken. Our Presiding     \nDirector chairs the Executive Committee, which\ndid not meet in 2022. Our Bylaws authorize the\nBoard to establish other committees. In June  \n2020, the Board formed a Special Committee on \nEquity & Inclusion to assist with its         \noversight of PNC\u2019s equity and inclusion       \nefforts, internally and externally, including \noversight of the implementation of PNC\u2019s      \npublicly-announced financial commitment to    \nhelp end systemic racism and support the      \neconomic empowerment of Black Americans and   \nlow-and moderate-income communities. The      \nSpecial Committee has met regularly since its \ninception. In April 2022, following an        \nassessment of its committee structure, the    \nBoard determined it was appropriate for the   \nTechnology Subcommittee to become a direct    \ncommittee of the Board rather than a          \nsubcommittee of the Risk Committee. Now named \nthe Technology Committee, the Committee has   \nresponsibility for assisting the Board with   \nits oversight of technology strategy and      \nsignificant technology initiatives and        \nprograms, including those that can position   \nthe use of technology to drive strategic      \nadvantages, and fulfilling the oversight      \nresponsibilities for technology risk,         \ninformation management and security risks     \n(including cybersecurity and cyber fraud and  \nphysical security risks) and the adequacy of  \nPNC\u2019s business recovery, continuity and       \ncontingency plans and test results. Our Bylaws\nalso provide that the Board may authorize the \nestablishment of subcommittees. The Board has \nformed a Compliance Subcommittee of the Risk  \nCommittee to facilitate Board-level oversight \nof compliance risk, significant compliance-   \nrelated initiatives and programs, and the     \nmaintenance of a strong compliance risk       \nmanagement culture. Each committee operates   \nunder a written charter approved by the Board,\nand the Compliance Subcommittee operates under\na written charter approved by the Risk        \nCommittee. Each committee and subcommittee    \nannually reviews and reassesses its charter.  \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee       \nassesses the Executive Committee charter. Each\ncommittee and subcommittee, other than the    \nExecutive Committee, performs an annual self- \nevaluation to determine whether it is         \nfunctioning effectively and fulfilling its    \ncharter duties.

At each      \nquarterly meeting of the full Board, the      \nchair of the Audit Committee presents a       \nreport of the items discussed and actions     \napproved at previous meetings of the          \nCommittee. The Audit Committee\u2019s              \nresponsibility is one of oversight.           \nManagement is responsible for preparing our   \nconsolidated financial statements, for        \nmaintaining internal controls and for our     \ncompliance with laws and regulations, and the \nindependent auditors are responsible for      \nauditing our consolidated financial           \nstatements. The Committee is responsible for  \nholding management accountable for            \nestablishing and maintaining an adequate and  \neffective internal control system and         \nprocesses. The Committee typically approves   \nthe internal and external audit plans, and    \nreviews and discusses audit reports and       \nresults with representatives of our internal  \naudit function and our independent auditors.  \nThe Committee also receives periodic reports  \non our compliance with applicable disclosure- \nrelated ESG laws and regulations, and         \ndiscusses with management applicable internal \nand disclosure controls                       \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             23  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE related to our key ESG   \ndisclosures. In addition, the Committee       \nreceives, reviews and discusses with          \nmanagement at least annually a report on PNC\u2019s\npolitical activity, including its major       \nlobbying priorities, participation in national\ntrade associations and contributions to       \npolitically involved organizations, and the   \noversight and governance of PNC\u2019s political   \nactivities. The Audit Committee has the       \nauthority to retain independent legal,        \naccounting, economic or other advisors. The   \nCommittee is directly responsible for the     \nselection, appointment, compensation and      \noversight of our independent auditors         \n(including the resolution of any disagreements\nthat may arise between management and the     \nindependent auditors regarding financial      \nreporting) for the purpose of preparing or    \nissuing an audit report or related work. The  \nindependent auditors report directly to the   \nCommittee. We describe the role of the        \nCommittee as it relates to the independent    \nauditors, including consideration of the      \nrotation of the independent audit firm, in    \nmore detail on page 96. With respect to work  \nperformed by the independent auditors, the    \nAudit Committee must approve all audit        \nengagement fees and terms, as well as all     \npermitted non-auditengagements. The Committee \n(or its delegate) pre-approvesall audit       \nservices, audit-related services and permitted\nnon-auditservices to be performed by the      \nindependent auditors. The Committee also      \nconsiders whether the provision of any audit  \nservices, audit-related services or permitted \nnon-auditservices will impair the auditors\u2019   \nindependence. We describe the Committee\u2019s     \nprocedures for the pre-approvalof audit       \nservices, audit-related services and permitted\nnon-auditservices on page 97. The Audit       \nCommittee receives periodic reports on        \nfinance, reserve adequacy, ethics, and        \ninternal and external audit. The Audit        \nCommittee also appoints our General Auditor,  \nwho leads our internal audit function and is  \nfunctionally accountable to the Committee. The\nCommittee holds regular executive sessions    \nwith management, the General Auditor, the     \nChief Ethics Officer and the independent      \nauditors. The Committee reviews the           \nperformance and approves the compensation of  \nthe General Auditor, and annually reviews the \nsuccession plans for the General Auditor and  \nthe General Auditor\u2019s direct reports with the \nCEO and the Board. Under our corporate        \ngovernance guidelines, Audit Committee members\nmay serve on the audit committees of no more  \nthan three public companies at the same time, \nincluding PNC.

The Board most      \nrecently approved the charter of the          \nNominating and Governance Committee on        \nNovember 10, 2022, and it is available on our \nwebsite at www.pnc.com/corporategovernance.   \nAt each quarterly meeting of the full Board,  \nthe chair of the Nominating and Governance    \nCommittee presents a report of the items      \ndiscussed and actions approved at previous    \nmeetings of the Committee. The primary        \npurpose of the Nominating and Governance      \nCommittee is to assist the Board in promoting \nthe best interests of PNC and its             \nshareholders through the implementation of    \nsound corporate governance principles and     \npractices. The Committee also assists the     \nBoard by identifying individuals qualified to \nbecome Board members. The Committee           \nrecommends to the Board the director nominees \nfor each annual meeting of shareholders, and  \nmay also recommend the appointment of         \nqualified individuals as directors between    \nannual meetings. The Committee also oversees  \nour engagement with shareholders regarding    \nESG matters. In addition to conducting its    \nannual committee self-evaluation, the         \nNominating and Governance Committee oversees  \nthe annual evaluation of the performance of   \nthe Board and other Board committees and      \nreports to the Board on the evaluation        \nresults as necessary or appropriate. The      \nCommittee also annually reviews and           \nrecommends any changes to the Executive       \nCommittee charter. How we evaluate directors  \nand director candidates. At least annually,   \nthe Nominating and Governance Committee       \nassesses the skills, qualifications and       \nexperience of our directors and recommends a  \nslate of director nominees to the Board. In   \nevaluating existing directors and new         \ndirector candidates, the Committee assesses   \nthe needs of the Board and the qualifications \nof the individual. From time to time, the     \nCommittee also considers whether to change    \nthe composition of the Board. See the         \ndiscussion on pages 9 to 17 for additional    \ninformation regarding each of our current     \ndirector nominees. The Board and its          \ncommittees must satisfy SEC, NYSE and banking \nregulatory standards. At least a majority of  \nour directors must be independent under NYSE  \nstandards. Our corporate governance           \nguidelines impose a more rigorous standard    \nand require that a substantial majority (at   \nleast two thirds) of our directors be         \nindependent. We require a sufficient number   \nof independent directors to satisfy the       \nmembership needs of Board committees that     \nalso require independence. The Nominating and \nGovernance Committee expects directors to     \ngain a sound understanding of our strategic   \nvision, our mix of businesses and our         \napproach to regulatory relations and risk     \nmanagement. The Board must possess a mix of   \nqualities and skills adequate to address the  \nvarious risks facing PNC.

When evaluating each director, as    \nwell as new director candidates for           \nnomination, the Committee considers the       \nfollowing criteria set forth in our corporate \ngovernance guidelines:                        \n                                              \n       A sustained record of high             \n       achievement in financial services,     \n  \u2022    business, industry, government,        \n       academia, the professions, or civic,   \n       charitable or non-profit               \n       organizations                          \n                                              \n                                          \n  \u2022    Manifest competence and integrity  \n                                          \n                                              \n       A strong commitment to the ethical     \n       and diligent pursuit of our            \n  \u2022    stakeholders\u2019 best interests,          \n       including our customers, communities,  \n       employees and shareholders             \n                                              \n                                              \n       The strength of character necessary    \n       to challenge management\u2019s              \n       recommendations and actions when       \n  \u2022    appropriate and to confirm the         \n       adequacy and completeness of           \n       management\u2019s responses to such         \n       challenges to his or her satisfaction  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The Board\u2019s strong desire to continue  \n  \u2022    adding diversity in terms of race,     \n       gender, professional background, life  \n       experience and social identity         \n                                              \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             25  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE Personal qualities that  \nwill help to sustain an atmosphere of mutual  \nrespect and collegiality among the members of \nthe Board The Nominating and Governance       \nCommittee also considers the current needs of \nthe Board and its committees, meeting         \nattendance and participation, and the value of\na director\u2019s contribution to the effectiveness\nof the Board and its committees. Although the \nBoard has not adopted a formal policy on      \ndiversity, the Board recognizes the value of a\ndiverse Board. Therefore, the Nominating and  \nGovernance Committee considers the diversity  \nof directors in the context of the Board\u2019s    \noverall needs, including the diversity of     \nperspective, experience, knowledge, education,\nage and skills of each director. The Committee\nevaluates diversity in a broad sense,         \nrecognizing the benefits of demographic and   \ncognitive diversity, and the breadth of       \ndiverse backgrounds, skills and experiences   \nthe directors bring to the Board. How we      \nidentify new directors. The Nominating and    \nGovernance Committee utilizes as a discussion \ntool a matrix of certain skills and           \nexperiences the Committee believes would be   \nbeneficial to have represented on the Board   \nand its committees. The Committee considers   \nPNC\u2019s strategy and industry trends in         \ndeveloping a view of those skills and         \ncharacteristics that would benefit the Board. \nThe Committee is also focused on what skills  \nare required or beneficial for those serving  \nin key Board positions, such as committee     \nchairs, and considers succession planning for \nthose positions. The Committee leverages the  \nmatrix and considers the Board-approved       \nevaluation criteria and various regulatory    \nrequirements described above when identifying \npotential director candidates, which it does  \nin a number of ways. The Committee            \nperiodically retains a search firm to identify\ncandidates. The Committee may consider        \nrecommendations made by our current or former \ndirectors or members of executive management. \nThe Committee may also identify potential     \ndirectors through contacts in the business,   \ncivic, academic, legal and non-               \nprofitcommunities. In addition, the Nominating\nand Governance Committee will consider        \ndirector candidates recommended by our        \nshareholders for nomination at the next year\u2019s\nannual meeting of shareholders. For the       \nCommittee to consider a director candidate    \nrecommended by a shareholder, the shareholder \nmust submit the recommendation in writing to  \nthe Corporate Secretary at our principal      \nexecutive offices. The submission must include\nthe information described under \u201cDirector     \nNomination Process\u201d in Section 3 of our       \ncorporate governance guidelines, which can be \nfound in the \u201cGovernance Documents\u201d section of\nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. To be        \nconsidered for the 2024 annual meeting of     \nshareholders, the submission must be received \nby November 16, 2023. The Nominating and      \nGovernance Committee will evaluate director   \ncandidates recommended by a shareholder in the\nsame manner as candidates identified by the   \nCommittee or recommended by others. The       \nCommittee will not consider any candidate with\nan obvious impediment to serving as one of our\ndirectors. The Nominating and Governance      \nCommittee will meet to review and discuss     \nrelevant available information regarding a    \ndirector candidate, considering the Board-    \napproved evaluation criteria, the candidate\u2019s \ncontribution to the diversity of the Board and\nPNC\u2019s evolving strategic needs. If the        \nCommittee decides not to recommend a candidate\nfor nomination or appointment, or for         \nadditional evaluation, no further action is   \ntaken, and in the case of a shareholder-      \nrecommended candidate, the Corporate Secretary\nwill communicate the decision to the          \nshareholder. If the Nominating and Governance \nCommittee decides to recommend a director     \ncandidate to the Board as a nominee for       \nelection at an annual meeting of shareholders \nor for appointment by the Board, the Chair of \nthe Committee will report that decision to the\nfull Board. Following a discussion regarding  \nthe recommendation, the full Board will vote  \non whether to nominate the candidate for      \nelection or appoint the candidate to the      \nBoard, as applicable. Invitations to join the \nBoard are extended by the Chair of the Board  \nand the Presiding Director, jointly acting on \nbehalf of the Board. Shareholders who wish to \nnominate a director candidate directly at an  \nannual meeting of shareholders or nominate and\ninclude a director candidate in our annual    \nmeeting proxy materials must do so in         \naccordance with the procedures contained in   \nour Bylaws as well as the additional          \nrequirements of SEC Rule 14a-19, as           \napplicable, as described in Shareholder       \nProposals for the 2024 Annual Meetingon page  \n105 under the headings Advance notice         \nproceduresand Proxy access                    \nprocedures,respectively.                      \n                                              \n  26    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE                          \n                                              \nHuman Resources Committee                     \n                                              \n              Chair              Other        \n                                 members:     \n  Debra A.

The        \nCommittee\u2019s membership is intended to satisfy \nthe independence standards established by     \napplicable federal income tax and securities  \nlaws, as well as NYSE standards. As Mr. Ward  \nhas reached the Board-established mandatory   \nretirement age, he will not stand for re-     \nelectionto the Board at the annual meeting,   \nand following the annual meeting will no      \nlonger be a member of the Committee. When the \nBoard meets on April 26, 2023 to organize its \ncommittees, only independent directors will   \nbe appointed to the Committee, including to   \nthe position of chair of the Committee. The   \nBoard most recently approved the charter of   \nthe Human Resources Committee on November 10, \n2022, and it is available on our website at   \nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. The Human    \nResources Committee\u2019s principal purpose is to \ndischarge the Board\u2019s responsibilities        \nrelating to the compensation of our executive \nmanagement and other specified                \nresponsibilities related to human resources   \nmatters affecting PNC. The Committee may also \noversee and approve, or recommend for         \napproval, employee benefit, bonus, incentive  \ncompensation, severance, equity-based or      \nother compensation or incentive plans or      \narrangements. The Human Resources Committee   \nhas the authority to retain independent       \nlegal, compensation, accounting or other      \nadvisors. The charter provides the Committee  \nwith the sole authority to retain and         \nterminate an independent compensation         \nconsultant acting on the Committee\u2019s behalf,  \nand to approve the consultant\u2019s fees and      \nother retention terms. The Committee retained \nan independent compensation consultant in     \n2022 and prior years. See Role of             \ncompensation consultantsbelow. The Human      \nResources Committee reviews with management   \nthe Compensation Discussion and               \nAnalysissection of the proxy statement, which \nbegins on page 44. The required report of the \nCommittee is included under Compensation      \nCommittee Reporton page 68. The Committee     \nalso evaluates the relationship between risk  \nmanagement and our incentive compensation     \nprograms and plans. See Compensation and      \nRiskbeginning on page 69. The Human Resources \nCommittee has responsibility for overseeing   \nour programs, policies and practices related  \nto talent and human capital strategy,         \nincluding those related to our commitment to  \ndiversity, equity and inclusion (to the       \nextent not within the purview of the Special  \nCommittee on Equity & Inclusion), the         \nrecruitment, development and retention of     \ntalent, employee engagement, health, safety   \nand well-being, and corporate culture. The    \nCommittee is responsible for the review and   \napproval of a talent management program that  \nprovides for development, recruitment and     \nsuccession planning for the CEO\u2019s direct      \nreports and their direct reports. The         \nCommittee is also responsible for overseeing  \nand annually evaluating the succession plans  \nfor the CEO, the CEO\u2019s direct reports and     \nthose individuals\u2019 direct reports (except for \nthe review and evaluation of the succession   \nplans for the General Auditor and Chief Risk  \nOfficer, which are performed by the Audit     \nCommittee and the Risk Committee,             \nrespectively). The executive management       \nsuccession plan, including for the CEO, is    \nalso reviewed with the full Board from time   \nto time. The Committee reviews a detailed     \nsuccession planning report at least annually. \nThe materials in the report typically include \na discussion of the individual performance of \neach executive officer, as well as succession \nplans and development initiatives for other   \nemerging talent. These materials provide      \nnecessary background and context to the       \nCommittee and help the Committee members to   \nbecome familiar with each employee\u2019s          \nposition, duties, responsibilities and        \nperformance. How we make decisions. The Human \nResources Committee meets at least four times \na year. Before each meeting, the chair of the \nCommittee reviews the agenda, materials and   \nissues with members of management and the     \nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation          \nconsultant, as appropriate. The Committee may \ninvite legal counsel or other external        \nconsultants to advise the Committee during    \nmeetings and preparatory sessions. The Human  \nResources Committee regularly meets in        \nexecutive sessions without management         \npresent. At each quarterly meeting of the     \nfull Board, the chair of the Committee        \npresents a report of the items discussed and  \nactions approved at previous meetings of the  \nCommittee.                                    \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             27  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE                          \n                                              \nThe Human Resources Committee has adopted     \nguidelines for information that will be       \npresented to the Committee. The guidelines    \ncontemplate, among other things, that any     \nmaterial change to a compensation program,    \nplan or arrangement will be considered over   \nthe course of at least two separate meetings  \nof the Committee, with any vote occurring no  \nearlier than the second meeting. The Human    \nResources Committee reviews all of the        \nelements of our compensation programs         \nperiodically and adjusts those programs as    \nappropriate. Each year, the Committee makes   \ndecisions regarding the amount of annual      \ncompensation and equity-based or other        \nlonger-term compensation for our executive    \nofficers and other designated senior          \nemployees. For the most part, these decisions \nare made in the first quarter of each year,   \nfollowing an evaluation of the prior year\u2019s   \nperformance. Delegations of authority .The    \nHuman Resources Committee has delegated       \nauthority to management to make certain       \ndecisions or take certain actions with        \nrespect to compensation or benefit plans or   \narrangements, other than those that are       \nsolely or predominantly for the benefit of    \nexecutive officers. For employee benefit,     \nbonus, incentive compensation, severance,     \nequity-based and other compensation or        \nincentive plans and arrangements, the         \nCommittee has delegated to the Chief Human    \nResources Officer (or her designee) the       \nability to adopt a new plan or arrangement or \namend an existing one if:                     \n                                              \n       the adoption or amendment is not       \n       expected to result in a significant    \n       increase in incremental expense to     \n       PNC (defined as an incremental annual  \n  \u2022    expense that exceeds $50\u00a0million for   \n       that plan category), the plan is       \n       broadly available to employees of PNC  \n       and the new plan or amendment would    \n       not confer a disproportionate benefit  \n       upon executives; or                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       the new plan or amendment is of a      \n       technical or administrative nature,    \n       is required by a change in applicable  \n  \u2022    law, is not otherwise material or,     \n       with respect to employee benefit       \n       plans, will not result in a            \n       significant impact on PNC\u2019s overall    \n       employee benefits program.             \n                                              \nThis delegation also includes the authority   \nto take certain actions to implement,         \nadminister, interpret or construe, or make    \neligibility determinations under, the plans   \nand arrangements, including the ability to    \nappoint a plan manager, administrator or      \ncommittee and to adopt policies and           \nprocedures with respect to the plan, except   \nwith respect to plans that are overseen by    \nPNC\u2019s administrative committee under its      \ncharter. For grants of equity or equity-based \nawards, the Human Resources Committee has     \ndelegated to the CEO and the Chief Human      \nResources Officer (or the designee of either) \nthe responsibility to make decisions with     \nrespect to equity grants for individuals who  \nare not designated by the Committee as        \nexecutives, including the determination of    \nparticipants and grant sizes, allocation of   \nthe pool from which a grant would be made,    \nestablishment and documentation of the terms  \nand conditions of such grants, approval of    \namendments to outstanding grants (subject to  \nany limitations set forth in the applicable   \nplan or the Committee\u2019s delegation of         \nauthority) and exercise of any discretionary  \nauthority provided to PNC or the Committee    \npursuant to the terms of the outstanding      \ngrants and the applicable plan. The Audit     \nCommittee and the Risk Committee (or in the   \ncase of equity-based grants, a qualified      \nsubcommittee of the Risk Committee) have the  \nauthority to award compensation under         \napplicable plans to our General Auditor and   \nour Chief Risk Officer, respectively.         \nManagement\u2019s role in compensation decisions.  \nOur executive officers, including the CEO and \nthe Chief Human Resources Officer, often      \nreview compensation information with the      \nHuman Resources Committee during Committee    \nmeetings and may present management\u2019s views   \nor recommendations. The Committee evaluates   \nthese recommendations, generally in           \nconsultation with an independent compensation \nconsultant retained by the Committee who      \nattends each meeting. The chair of the Human  \nResources Committee typically meets with      \nmanagement and an independent compensation    \nconsultant before each meeting of the         \nCommittee to discuss agenda topics, areas of  \nfocus or outstanding issues. The chair of the \nCommittee schedules other meetings with the   \nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation          \nconsultant without management present as      \nneeded. Occasionally, management will         \nschedule meetings with the chair of the       \nCommittee or other Committee members to       \ndiscuss substantive issues. For more          \ncomplicated issues, these one-on-onemeetings  \nprovide a dedicated forum for Committee       \nmembers to ask questions outside of the       \nmeeting environment. During Human Resources   \nCommittee meetings, the CEO often reviews     \ncorporate and individual performance as part  \nof the compensation discussions, and other    \nmembers of executive management may be        \ninvited to speak to the Committee about       \nspecific elements of performance or risk      \nmanagement. Our Chief Risk Officer regularly  \npresents to the Committee regarding risk      \nmanagement, including its impact on the       \nCommittee\u2019s discussions and decisions         \nregarding executive compensation. The         \nCommittee reviews compensation decisions for  \nthe Chief Human Resources Officer and the CEO \nin executive session, without either officer  \npresent for the discussion of their           \ncompensation. Any decisions on CEO            \ncompensation are also discussed with the full \nBoard in executive session.                   \n                                              \n  28    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE                          \n                                              \nRole of compensation consultants. The Human   \nResources Committee has the sole authority to \nretain and terminate any compensation         \nconsultant directly assisting it. The         \nCommittee also has the sole authority to      \napprove fees and other engagement terms. The  \nCommittee receives comparative compensation   \ndata from management, from proxy statements   \nand other public disclosures, and through     \nsurveys and reports prepared by compensation  \nconsultants. The Human Resources Committee    \nretained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC  \n(\u201cMeridian\u201d) as its independent compensation  \nconsultant for 2022. In this capacity,        \nMeridian reported directly to the Committee.  \nIn 2022, one or more representatives of       \nMeridian attended all meetings of the         \nCommittee, and met regularly with the         \nCommittee without members of management       \npresent. Meridian also reviewed meeting       \nagendas and materials prepared by management. \nMeridian and members of management assisted   \nthe Human Resources Committee in its review   \nof proposed compensation packages for our     \nexecutive officers. For the 2022 performance  \nyear, Meridian prepared discussion materials  \nfor the compensation of the CEO, which were   \nreviewed by the Committee in executive        \nsession. Meridian also prepared other         \nbenchmarking reviews and pay for performance  \nanalyses for the Committee. PNC paid no fees  \nto Meridian in 2022 other than fees paid in   \nconnection with work performed by Meridian    \nfor the Committee. The Human Resources        \nCommittee evaluated whether the work of       \nMeridian raised any conflicts of interest.    \nThe Committee considered various factors,     \nincluding the six factors mandated by SEC     \nrules, and determined that no conflict of     \ninterest was raised by the work performed by  \nMeridian for the Committee. Management        \nretains other compensation consultants for    \nits own use. In 2022, management retained     \nMcLagan to provide certain market data in the \nfinancial services industry.

Compensation committee interlocks  \nand insider participation. During 2022, the   \nmembers of the Human Resources Committee      \nincluded Charles E. Bunch, Debra A. Cafaro,   \nAndrew T. Feldstein, Richard J. Harshman,     \nRobert A. Niblock, Michael J. Ward and Toni   \nTownes-Whitley. None of these directors were  \nofficers or employees of PNC during 2022, nor \nare they former officers of PNC or any of our \nsubsidiaries. During 2022, no executive       \nofficer of PNC served on the board of         \ndirectors or compensation committee (or other \nboard committee performing equivalent         \nfunctions) of an entity that had an executive \nofficer who served on the Board or the Human  \nResources Committee. Certain members of the   \nHuman Resources Committee, their immediate    \nfamily members or entities with which they    \nare affiliated were our customers or had      \ntransactions with us (or our subsidiaries)    \nduring 2022. Transactions that involved loans \nor commitments by subsidiary banks were made  \nin the ordinary course of business on         \nsubstantially the same terms, including       \ninterest rates and collateral, as those       \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \ntransactions with other persons and did not   \ninvolve more than the normal risk of          \ncollectability or present other unfavorable   \nfeatures, and otherwise complied with         \nregulatory restrictions applicable to such    \ntransactions.

The Board most      \nrecently approved the charter of the Risk     \nCommittee on November 10, 2022, and it is     \navailable on our website at                   \nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. The Risk     \nCommittee\u2019s purpose is to require and oversee \nthe establishment and implementation of our   \nenterprise-wide risk governance framework,    \nincluding related policies, procedures,       \nactivities and processes to identify, assess, \nmonitor and manage material risks at PNC      \n(except for accounting and financial          \nreporting risk exposures and related          \nreputational risks, which are the             \nresponsibility of the Audit Committee). The   \nRisk Committee serves as the primary point of \ncontact between the Board and the management- \nlevel committees dealing with risk            \nmanagement. The Committee receives regular    \nreports on enterprise risk management and     \ncapital and liquidity management, as well as  \ncredit, market, operational, line of          \nbusiness, model, environmental and social     \n(including climate-related), and reputational \nrisks. At each quarterly meeting of the full  \nBoard, the chair of the Risk Committee        \npresents a report of the items discussed and  \nactions approved at previous meetings of the  \nCommittee. The Risk Committee also appoints   \nour Chief Risk Officer, who leads our risk    \nmanagement function. The Committee reviews    \nthe performance and approves the compensation \nof the Chief Risk Officer, except with        \nrespect to his equity-based grants, which are \napproved by a qualified subcommittee of the   \nRisk Committee. The Committee reviews the     \nsuccession plans for the Chief Risk Officer   \nand the Chief Risk Officer\u2019s direct reports   \nwith the CEO annually and with the Board from \ntime to time. The Risk Committee, along with  \nthe Human Resources Committee, reviews the    \nrisk components of our incentive compensation \nplans. For a discussion of the relationship   \nbetween compensation and risk, see            \nCompensation and Riskbeginning on page 69.    \nCompliance Subcommittee. The Risk Committee   \nmay form subcommittees as appropriate from    \ntime to time.

These relationships      \ninclude transactions we considered in         \ndetermining the independence of our directors.\nIn this section, we describe the NYSE         \nindependence standards for directors and our  \nBoard-adopted independence guidelines.        \nDirector independence The Board must          \naffirmatively determine that a director has no\n\u201cmaterial relationship\u201d with PNC for the      \ndirector to qualify as independent under NYSE \nrules. A material relationship between a      \ndirector and PNC can exist as a result of a   \nrelationship between PNC and an organization  \naffiliated with the director. Material        \nrelationships may include commercial,         \nindustrial, banking, consulting, legal,       \naccounting, charitable and family             \nrelationships. The ownership of a significant \namount of PNC stock, by itself, will not      \nprevent a finding of independence under NYSE  \nrules. NYSE rules describe specific           \nrelationships that will always impair         \nindependence. The absence of one of the       \nenumerated relationships under this \u201cbright-  \nline\u201d test does not mean that a director is   \ndeemed independent. The Board must consider   \nall relevant facts and circumstances in       \ndetermining whether a material relationship   \nexists.

Our Board guidelines on      \nindependence.To help assess director          \nindependence, the Board adopted guidelines    \nthat describe four categories of relationships\nthat will not be deemed to be material. If a  \nrelationship involving a director meets the   \ncriteria outlined in the guidelines, the Board\nmay affirm the director\u2019s independence without\nfurther analysis of that relationship,        \nprovided that the director otherwise meets the\nrelevant independence tests. These guidelines \nare included in our corporate governance      \nguidelines, which can be found in the         \n\u201cGovernance Documents\u201d section of our website \nat www.pnc.com/corporategovernance.

In applying these\nguidelines, an \u201cimmediate family member\u201d      \nincludes a person\u2019s spouse, parents, children,\nsiblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law,sons-   \nand daughters-in-law,brothers- and sisters-in-\nlaw,and anyone (other than domestic employees)\nwho shares such person\u2019s home.

The Board\u2019s independence         \ndeterminations. At a meeting held on February \n16, 2023, the Board made an independence      \ndetermination for each of our directors,      \nincluding our director nominees. In making    \nthese determinations, the Board relied on the \nevaluation and recommendations made by the    \nNominating and Governance Committee. The Board\nconsidered relevant facts and circumstances,  \nincluding an evaluation of the relationships  \ndescribed in this proxy statement. In some    \ncases, the relationships the Board evaluated  \nincluded relationships a director has as a    \npartner, member, shareholder, officer or      \nemployee of an organization that has a        \nrelationship with PNC. The relationships      \nevaluated may have also included relationships\nwhere an immediate family member of a director\nis a partner, member, shareholder or officer  \nof an organization that has a relationship    \nwith PNC. The Board based its independence    \ndecisions on information known as of February \n16, 2023. Each director has been asked to     \nprovide updates regarding any changes in      \ncircumstances that could impact the director\u2019s\nstatus as an independent director. The        \nNominating and Governance Committee and the   \nBoard will consider information received      \nthroughout the year that may impact director  \nindependence. Non-independentdirectors. The   \nBoard determined that Mr. Demchak is a non-   \nindependentdirector under the NYSE\u2019s bright-  \nline independence tests because he is an      \nexecutive officer of PNC. Independent         \ndirectors. Based on its evaluation of the     \nfacts and circumstances of relevant           \nrelationships, the Board affirmatively        \ndetermined that each director and director    \nnominee other than Mr. Demchak qualifies as   \nindependent under NYSE rules.                 \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             37  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nDIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER RELATIONSHIPS  \nTransactions with directors Customer          \nrelationships.We provide financial services to\nmost of our directors, some of their immediate\nfamily members and certain of their respective\naffiliated entities.

We also prohibit directors and      \nemployees from transacting business on behalf \nof PNC with respect to their own accounts,    \nextended family member accounts or accounts   \nfor anyone whose close relationship may       \nreasonably be viewed as creating a conflict of\ninterest. Our phrase \u201cextended family member\u201d \nis similar to the SEC\u2019s definition of         \n\u201cimmediate family member\u201d in Item 404(a) of   \nRegulation S-K.We have established procedures \nin certain of our businesses to permit        \nemployees to transact business with family    \nmembers, subject to appropriate oversight and \ncompliance with applicable laws and           \nregulations, including Regulation O. Employing\nrelatives. We employ relatives of certain     \nexecutive officers and directors, in some     \ncases under circumstances that constitute     \nrelated person transactions. For additional   \ninformation, see Director and Executive       \nOfficer Relationships\u2014 Family relationshipson \npage 40. We track the employment and          \ncompensation of relatives of our executive    \nofficers and directors, and we have policies  \nthat restrict special treatment in the hiring \nor compensation of a relative of an executive \nofficer or director. Our employment of a      \ndirector\u2019s relative is also a factor in the   \ndetermination of the director\u2019s independence  \nunder NYSE rules and our own adopted          \nguidelines regarding director independence.   \nSee Director and Executive Officer            \nRelationships\u2014Director independencebeginning  \non page 36. Waivers. Employees may generally  \nrequest waivers or exceptions from certain    \nprovisions of the Code of Business Conduct and\nEthics from our Corporate Ethics Office. In   \nthe case of directors and executive officers, \nany proposed waiver or exception must be      \napproved by both our Corporate Ethics Office  \nand the appropriate Board committee. In 2022, \nno directors or executive officers requested a\nwaiver of any of the provisions described     \nabove. Ethics Guidelines for Directors. The   \nAudit Committee has adopted Ethics Guidelines \nfor Directors that contain comprehensive      \nguidance regarding the various PNC policies   \ngoverning the conduct of our directors. The   \nguidelines are designed to supplement and     \nassist directors in understanding relevant    \npolicies, including our Code of Business      \nConduct and Ethics described above, our       \nRegulation O policies and procedures and our  \nRelated Person Transactions Policy, each      \ndescribed in more detail below, our Director  \nPre-Clearanceof Securities Policy and our     \nAnti-Corruption Policy. The Ethics Guidelines \nfor Directors were most recently approved on  \nAugust 10, 2022. Regulation O policies and    \nprocedures We maintain additional policies and\nprocedures to help ensure our compliance with \nRegulation O, which imposes various conditions\non a bank\u2019s extension of credit to directors  \nand executive officers and their related      \ninterests. Any extensions of credit we make   \nmust comply with our Regulation O policies and\nprocedures. Our Regulation O policies and     \nprocedures require:                           \n                                              \n       Extensions of credit to covered        \n       individuals or entities be made on     \n       substantially the same terms           \n       (including interest rates and          \n       collateral) as those prevailing at     \n  \u2022    the time for comparable transactions   \n       with those who\u00a0are not covered. For    \n       credit extensions under a benefit or   \n       compensatory program widely available  \n       to all employees, we may not give      \n       preference to any covered individual;  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The covered extension of credit be     \n       made following credit underwriting     \n       procedures no less stringent than      \n       those prevailing at the time for       \n  \u2022    comparable transactions with           \n       non-covered individuals or entities.   \n       The extension of credit may not        \n       involve more than the normal risk of   \n       repayment or present other             \n       unfavorable features; and              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The amount of covered extensions of    \n       credit do not exceed individual and    \n  \u2022    aggregate lending limits, depending    \n       on the identity of the borrower and    \n       the nature of the loan.                \n                                              \nOur subsidiary bank, PNC Bank, National       \nAssociation, has a Regulation O Credit Officer\nwho reviews extensions of credit to Regulation\nO insiders to determine our compliance with   \nthese policies. If an extension of credit     \nwould result in an aggregate extension of     \ncredit of more than $500,000, or an extension \nof credit is proposed in connection with an   \ninsider whose aggregate extensions of credit  \nalready exceed $500,000, the bank\u2019s Board of  \nDirectors must approve it in                  \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             39  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nDIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER RELATIONSHIPS  \nadvance. In addition, a director can only meet\nour guidelines for independence with respect  \nto extensions of credit if the credit complied\nwith Regulation O at the time PNC extended it.\nThe bank\u2019s Board of Directors receives a      \nreport of all extensions of credit made to    \ndirectors and executive officers and their    \nrelated interests under Regulation O. All     \nloans to our directors and executive officers \nand their related interests outstanding during\n2022 complied with Regulation O. Family       \nrelationships No family relationships exist   \namong any of our directors or executive       \nofficers. There are family relationships      \nbetween certain of our directors and executive\nofficers and some of the approximately 61,000 \nPNC employees. These employees, including     \nthose discussed below, participate in         \ncompensation and incentive plans or           \narrangements on the same basis as other       \nsimilarly situated employees. A brother-in-   \nlawof Gregory Jordan, one of our executive    \nofficers, is employed by PNC and had been for \nmany years before Mr. Jordan joined PNC in    \n2013. He does not share a household with Mr.  \nJordan, is not an executive officer of PNC and\ndoes not report directly to an executive      \nofficer of PNC. His compensation paid in 2022 \nexceeded the $120,000 related person          \ntransaction threshold and as a result was     \nreviewed by the Audit Committee. Two sons of  \nMichael Hannon, one of our executive officers,\nare employed by PNC. They do not share a      \nhousehold with Mr. Hannon, are not executive  \nofficers of PNC and do not report directly to \nan executive officer of PNC. The compensation \npaid to each in 2022 exceeded the $120,000    \nrelated person transaction threshold and as a \nresult was reviewed by the Audit Committee.   \nIndemnification and advancement of costs We   \nindemnify directors, executive officers and in\nsome cases employees and agents against       \ncertain liabilities. The covered person may   \nhave incurred a liability as a result of      \nservice on our behalf or at our request. We   \nmay also advance the costs of certain claims  \nor proceedings on behalf of a covered person. \nIf we advance costs, the covered person agrees\nto repay us if it is determined that the      \nperson was not entitled to indemnification.   \nThe insurance policies we maintain for our    \ndirectors and executive officers also provide \ncoverage against certain liabilities. The     \nindemnification provisions, the advancement of\ncosts and our insurance coverage may provide  \nbenefits to our directors and executive       \nofficers. During 2022, we did not advance     \nlegal costs to any director or executive      \nofficer.                                      \n                                              \n  40    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nRELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS Related person    \ntransactions policy A related person          \ntransaction is generally any transaction in   \nwhich PNC or its subsidiaries is or will be a \nparticipant, the amount involved exceeds      \n$120,000 and a director (or nominee),         \nexecutive officer, family member or any       \nbeneficial owner of more than 5% of our common\nstock has or will have a direct or indirect   \nmaterial interest. Our policy for the review  \nand approval of related person transactions   \nwas most recently approved on August 10, 2022.\nThis policy provides guidance on the framework\nfor reviewing potential related person        \ntransactions and approving or ratifying       \nrelated person transactions, and establishes  \nour Presiding Director as the individual who  \ndecides how transactions should be evaluated. \nIn general, a potential related person        \ntransaction that involves a director would be \nreviewed by the Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee, as the transaction could also      \nimpact independence. A transaction that       \ninvolves an executive officer or beneficial   \nowner of more than 5% of our common stock     \nwould generally be reviewed by the Audit      \nCommittee. The full Board receives reports on \napproved, disapproved and ratified            \ntransactions. Under the policy, a related     \nperson transaction may be permitted only if   \nthe appropriate Board committee approves the  \ntransaction as not inconsistent with the      \ninterests of PNC and its shareholders and the \ntransaction is on terms comparable to those   \nthat could be obtained in arm\u2019s length        \ndealings with an unrelated third party.       \nCertain related person transactions Based on  \ninformation contained in a Schedule 13G filed \nwith the SEC, BlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d),  \nthrough certain of its subsidiaries, indicated\nthat it beneficially owned more than 5% of our\noutstanding shares of common stock as of      \nDecember 31, 2022 (see Security Ownership of  \nManagement and Certain Beneficial             \nOwners\u2014Security ownership of certain          \nbeneficial ownerson page 95). BlackRock is the\nbeneficial owner of our common stock as a     \nresult of being a parent company or control   \nperson of the subsidiaries disclosed in its   \nSchedule 13G, each of which holds less than 5%\nof our outstanding shares of common stock.    \nDuring 2022, we paid BlackRock approximately  \n$8.3 million for use of BlackRock\u2019s enterprise\ninvestment system and related services, which \ninclude risk analytics, portfolio management, \ncompliance and operational processing. We also\npaid BlackRock approximately $2.9 million for \nsecurities trading related services and       \napproximately $0.1 million for investment     \nadvisory and administration services provided \nto certain of our subsidiaries and separate   \naccounts assets for a fee based on assets     \nunder management. These transactions were     \nentered into on an arm\u2019s length basis and     \ncontain customary terms and conditions. During\n2022, we received approximately $6.2 million  \nin fees from BlackRock for distribution and   \nshareholder servicing activities. These       \ntransactions were entered into on an arm\u2019s    \nlength basis and contain customary terms and  \nconditions. We may in the ordinary course of  \nbusiness engage in transactions with BlackRock\nmutual funds, including using the BlackRock   \nfunds as treasury management vehicles for our \ncorporate clients, selling BlackRock          \ninvestment products to our customers or       \nplacing our customer funds in BlackRock mutual\nfunds, using BlackRock funds as an investment \nvehicle for the PNC 401(k) accounts, providing\ncommercial loan servicing to BlackRock funds  \nor providing shareholder services to our      \nclients who are shareholders of BlackRock     \nmutual funds. We may also make loans to       \nBlackRock or the BlackRock funds. These loans \nare made in the ordinary course of business on\nsubstantially the same terms, including       \ninterest rates and collateral, as those       \nprevailing at the time for comparable loans   \nwith persons not related to PNC, and do not   \ninvolve more than the normal risk of          \ncollectability. Based on information contained\nin a Schedule 13G filing with the SEC, The    \nVanguard Group (\u201cVanguard\u201d) indicated it      \nbeneficially owned more than 5% of our        \noutstanding shares of common stock as of      \nDecember 31, 2022 (see Security Ownership of  \nManagement and Certain Beneficial             \nOwners\u2014Security ownership of certain          \nbeneficial ownerson page 95). In the ordinary \ncourse of business during 2022, our Corporate \n& Institutional Banking business engaged in   \ntreasury management transactions and banking  \ntransactions with Vanguard. These transactions\nwere entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis and\ncontained customary terms and conditions. PNC \nalso participates in two syndicated credit    \nfacilities to Vanguard and Vanguard-managed   \nfunds. These credit transactions were on      \nsubstantially the same terms, including       \ninterest rates and collateral, as those       \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \nfacilities with persons not related to PNC,   \nand did not involve more than the normal risk \nof collectibility. In addition, our Asset     \nManagement Group and PNC Investments each     \ninclude Vanguard funds in their respective    \ninvestment platforms.                         \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             41  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION The Nominating and      \nGovernance Committee of the Board reviews all \nelements of non-employeedirector compensation,\nwhich are described below, and makes an annual\ncompensation recommendation to the Board. Mr. \nDemchak receives no additional compensation   \nfor serving as a PNC director. In addition to \nannual compensation, the Committee may approve\nspecial compensation to a director for        \nextraordinary service. The primary objectives \nof the Committee\u2019s annual review are to       \nconfirm continued alignment with business and \nshareholder interests, evaluate our director  \ncompensation program relative to our peers,   \nand identify and respond to continued changes \nin director compensation in light of the      \ncompetitive environment. The Committee        \nconducted its annual compensation review for  \n2022 on April 27, 2022. The following table   \ndescribes the components of non-              \nemployeedirector compensation in 2022:        \n                                              \n  Annual Retainer                             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Each director                   $   95,000  \n  Additional retainer for         $   45,000  \n  Presiding Director                          \n  Additional retainer for                     \n  Chairs of Audit, Human                      \n  Resources, Nominating and       $   25,000  \n  Governance, Risk,                           \n  Technology and Equity &                     \n  Inclusion Committees                        \n  Additional retainer for                     \n  Chair of Compliance             $   25,000  \n  Subcommittee                                \n  Meeting Fees (Committee and                 \n  Subcommittee Meetings                       \n  Only)                                       \n  First six meetings              $    1,500  \n  Each additional meeting         $    2,000  \n  Equity-Based Grants                         \n  Value of 880 deferred stock                 \n  units awarded as of             $  149,978  \n  April 27, 2022                              \n                                              \nDeferred compensation plans.Our non-          \nmanagementdirectors may choose to defer the   \ncompensation they receive for meeting fees and\nretainers under our Directors Deferred        \nCompensation Plan. Under this plan, the       \ndirectors may elect to defer compensation into\nan account that tracks the price of PNC common\nstock or an interest rate defined in the plan.\nThe accounts that track the price of PNC      \ncommon stock are credited with a number of    \nunits (including fractional shares) that could\nhave been purchased with the equivalent of PNC\ncommon stock cash dividends. We do not pay    \nabove-market or preferential earnings on any  \ndirector compensation that is deferred. The   \ndirectors may choose the payout date and      \nwhether the payout, which is made in cash,    \nwill be in a lump sum or up to 10 annual      \ninstallment payments. Under the Outside       \nDirectors Deferred Stock Unit Program, a      \nsubprogram of the 2016 Incentive Award Plan,  \neach non-employeedirector is eligible to      \nreceive an annual grant of deferred stock     \nunits that vest immediately upon grant and are\npaid out in shares of PNC common stock at     \nretirement. The deferred stock units accrue   \ndividends with reinvestment equal to the      \nnumber of units that could have been purchased\nwith the equivalent of PNC common stock cash  \ndividends (rounded down to the nearest whole  \nshare). Other director benefits.We generally  \nlimit the benefits we provide to our          \ndirectors, but we regularly provide the       \nfollowing:                                    \n                                              \n       Charitable matching gifts. We will     \n       match a non-employee director\u2019s        \n  \u2022    personal gifts to qualifying           \n       charities up to a limit of $5,000 per  \n       year.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Insurance policies. We pay for         \n       various insurance policies that        \n  \u2022    protect directors and their families   \n       from personal loss connected with      \n       Board service.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Expenses related to Board service. We  \n       pay for expenses connected with our    \n  \u2022    directors\u2019 Board service, including    \n       travel on corporate, private or        \n       commercial aircraft, lodging, meals    \n       and incidentals.                       \n                                              \nWe may also provide other incidental benefits \nto our directors from time to time, including \ntickets to cultural, social, sporting or other\nevents and small gifts for holidays, birthdays\nor special occasions. In limited              \ncircumstances, we may also provide travel for \ndirectors on corporate aircraft for personal  \npurposes, such as when a family emergency     \narises or a seat is available on a previously \nscheduled flight. We determine the value of   \nthese benefits based on the incremental cost  \nto PNC and we include the amount in the \u201cAll  \nOther Compensation\u201d column of the Director    \ncompensation in 2022 table below. Director    \nstock ownership requirement.The Board has     \nadopted a common stock purchase guideline for \nour non-managementdirectors. Under this       \nguideline, each director must own shares of   \nPNC common stock (including phantom stock     \nunits) with a value of at least five times the\nvalue of his or her annual base retainer.     \nUntil a director meets this ownership level,  \nhe or she must purchase or acquire common     \nstock or stock units that equal at least 25%  \nof the annual retainer for that year.

Capitalizing on       \nopportunities across our coast-to-            \ncoastfranchise, we grew loans and generated   \nrecord revenue during a rapidly rising        \ninterest rate environment. At the same time,  \nwe controlled expenses and delivered          \nsubstantial positive operating leverage       \n(growing revenue faster than expenses). Our   \ncredit quality metrics remained strong, and   \nour solid capital position allowed us to      \nreturn $6 billion of capital to shareholders  \nthroughout the year.

Our compensation      \nprogram This section discusses how we view    \nexecutive compensation and why we make the    \ndecisions that we do. The Human Resources     \nCommittee of the Board (referred to in this   \nCD&A as the \u201cCommittee\u201d) uses the following   \nprinciples to help guide its executive        \ncompensation decisions: Compensation          \nprinciples                                    \n                                              \n                        Provide appropriate   \n  Pay for               compensation for      \n  performance           demonstrated          \n                        performance across    \n                        the enterprise        \n                        Align executive       \n                        compensation with     \n  Create value          long-term             \n                        shareholder value     \n                        creation              \n                        Provide competitive   \n                        compensation          \n                        opportunities to      \n  Manage talent         attract, retain and   \n                        motivate              \n                        high-quality          \n                        executives            \n                        Encourage focus on    \n  Discourage            the long-term         \n  excessive             success of PNC and    \n  risk-taking           discourage excessive  \n                        risk-taking           \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the successful    \napplication of these principles requires a    \nthoughtful program design, which includes a   \nbalanced evaluation of performance. The       \nCommittee believes that discretion,           \nflexibility and judgment are critical to its  \nability to award incentive compensation that  \nreflects near-term performance results and    \nprogress toward longer-term strategic         \npriorities that allow PNC to create value for \nour shareholders. See Evaluating performanceon\npage 49 for more information on how the       \nCommittee evaluates performance. Key program  \nfeatures The Committee reviews and approves   \nthe compensation to be paid to our NEOs. We   \nseek clarity and transparency in our          \ncompensation structure, using features that we\nbelieve will help to create a balanced        \nprogram. While we consider the expectations of\nvarious stakeholders, we want our compensation\nprogram to achieve multiple objectives,       \nconsistent with our compensation principles.  \nThe Committee also regularly reviews the      \noperation of our compensation program to help \nensure that our objectives continue to be met.\nTaken as a whole, our executive compensation  \nprogram includes several complementary        \nfeatures:                                     \n                                              \n  We provide incentives for performance over  \n  different time horizons (short- and         \n  long-term).                                 \n  We embed performance goals into a           \n  significant                                 \n  portion of our long-term incentives and     \n  include a                                   \n  risk-based performance review that could    \n  reduce or                                   \n  eliminate the awards.                       \n  We reward achievement against both          \n  quantitative                                \n  and qualitative goals, while allowing for   \n  discretion.                                 \n  We connect pay to company performance,      \n  relative to                                 \n  both our internal objectives and controls   \n  and the                                     \n  performance of a carefully selected peer    \n  group.                                      \n  We consider market data and trends when     \n  making pay                                  \n  decisions.                                  \n  We place a substantial majority of          \n  compensation at                             \n  risk.                                       \n  We pay some incentive compensation in cash  \n  today,                                      \n  while deferring most of our incentives for  \n  several                                     \n  years through potential equity-based        \n  payouts.                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  46    THE PNC

                           \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \nRegulatory expectations As a large diversified\nfinancial services company, we must comply    \nwith various regulatory requirements. The     \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the\n\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) regulates PNC as a bank    \nholding company and has provided guidance and \nset expectations with respect to our          \ncompensation program. The Office of the       \nComptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d)       \nregulates our primary banking subsidiary, and \nalso sets expectations for our compensation   \nprogram. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and     \nother financial industry regulatory entities, \nincluding the SEC, may provide guidance       \nperiodically on compensation matters. Total   \ncompensation targets Each NEO has a total     \ncompensation target for the year that consists\nof a base salary and an incentive compensation\ntarget (composed of annual cash and long-term \nequity-based awards). We generally set these  \ntargets in the first quarter of the year or   \nwhen an executive joins PNC or assumes new    \nresponsibilities. Total compensation targets  \ninclude the following components: When        \nconstructing an appropriate total compensation\ntarget for an NEO, the Committee uses a       \nframework that is consistent with our         \ncompensation principles:                      \n                                              \n  We set targets using several factors,       \n  including                                   \n  market data. The Committee reviews          \n  available                                   \n  market data but does not use a formula to   \n  set an                                      \n  executive\u2019s target compensation. The        \n  Committee                                   \n  evaluates many factors, including the       \n  appropriateness of the job match and        \n  market data,                                \n  the responsibilities of the position and    \n  the                                         \n  executive\u2019s demonstrated performance,       \n  skills and                                  \n  experience.                                 \n  At least 50% of compensation is             \n  equity-based and                            \n  not payable for several years. The          \n  Committee                                   \n  believes that a significant portion of      \n  compensation should be at risk, tied to     \n  PNC stock                                   \n  performance and not payable, if at all,     \n  for                                         \n  several years. Accordingly, at the          \n  beginning of                                \n  the performance year, the Committee         \n  establishes a                               \n  specific minimum percentage of each         \n  executive\u2019s                                 \n  total compensation that will be delivered   \n  through                                     \n  long-term equity-based awards. For 2022,    \n  the                                         \n  Committee designated that all current NEOs  \n  would                                       \n  receive at least 50% of their total         \n  compensation                                \n  through long-term equity-based awards. The  \n  specific mix of cash and equity for each    \n  NEO is                                      \n  discussed in more detail on page 56.        \n  We split the equity-based incentive         \n  between two                                 \n  forms of awards. Each NEO who receives a    \n  long-term                                   \n  equity-based incentive award generally      \n  receives                                    \n  the award in two primary forms, a           \n  Performance                                 \n  Share Unit (\u201cPSU\u201d) representing 60% of the  \n  value                                       \n  of the long-term award, and a Restricted    \n  Share                                       \n  Unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) representing 40% of the        \n  value.                                      \n  Payouts under these awards are deferred     \n  over                                        \n  multiple years. For information on the      \n  terms of                                    \n  these awards, see pages 49 to 52.           \n                                              \n                                              \n  48    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \nEvaluating performance The Committee believes \nthe total compensation targets collectively   \nprovide an appropriate balance between fixed  \nand variable amounts, measuring short-term and\nlong-term performance, immediate and deferred \npayouts, and cash and equity-based awards. For\ninformation on how the Committee\u2019s incentive  \ncompensation decisions compared to the targets\nfor the 2022 performance year, see page 56.   \nThe Committee believes that an effective      \nexecutive compensation program requires a     \ncomprehensive evaluation of performance across\nmultiple categories. This evaluation generally\nincludes a review of financial performance,   \nhow we executed against our strategic         \nobjectives and how we manage risk, customer   \nexperience and leadership. The Committee has  \nnot adopted a formula-driven compensation     \nprogram, believing that formulas may reward   \nshort-term results or behaviors that do not   \nserve the long-term interests of our          \nshareholders. Metrics that rely solely on     \nformulas may also be inappropriately skewed by\nresults outside of management\u2019s control.      \nFinally, formulas may undervalue important    \nstrategic objectives that do not translate to \neasily or immediately quantifiable metrics. As\na result, the Committee evaluates a variety of\nquantitative and qualitative metrics to attain\na comprehensive understanding of PNC\u2019s overall\nperformance. To the extent possible, the      \nperformance metrics reviewed by the Committee \nalign the objectives of our management,       \nshareholders and federal banking regulators.  \nIn some cases, these stakeholders have        \ndifferent objectives that cannot be easily    \nreconciled \u2014 for example, shareholders seeking\nhigher returns may be willing to tolerate more\nrisk than a federal banking regulator would   \naccept. That is another reason we rely on     \nmultiple metrics, representing performance    \nagainst a range of goals, and include the     \nability to make significant adjustments for   \nrisk management performance. The CEO reviews  \nPNC\u2019s quarterly and annual performance with   \nthe Committee. During these quarterly reviews,\nthe Committee receives a report on the        \nfollowing metrics, with comparisons to the    \nprior year\u2019s results, the current year\u2019s      \nbudget or peer performance results, as        \nappropriate:                                  \n                                              \n  Category of                  Metrics        \n  Metric                       Evaluated      \n  Financial                                   \n  Performance                                 \n  (measured                                   \n  against                      Net interest   \n  prior year,                  income         \n  current year                                \n  budget and                                  \n  peer                                        \n  group)                                      \n                Noninterest                   \n                income*                       \n                EPS growth*                   \n                Return on                     \n                assets*                       \n                Return on                     \n                equity*                       \n                Risk-adjusted                 \n                efficiency                    \n                ratio                         \n  Capital,                                    \n  Risk and                                    \n  Expense                                     \n  Management                                  \n  (measured                    Tangible book  \n  against                      value          \n  prior year                                  \n  and to the                                  \n  extent                                      \n  available,                                  \n  peer group)                                 \n                CET1 ratio                    \n                Loans to                      \n                deposits                      \n                ratio                         \n                Net                           \n                charge-offs                   \n                to average                    \n                loans                         \n                Allowance for                 \n                loan and                      \n                leases losses                 \n                to total                      \n                loans                         \n                Noninterest                   \n                expense                       \n  Business                                    \n  Growth                                      \n  (measured                                   \n  against                                     \n  prior                                       \n  year,                        Average loan   \n  current year                 balances       \n  budget and                                  \n  to the                                      \n  extent                                      \n  available,                                  \n  peer group)                                 \n                Allowance for                 \n                loan and                      \n                lease losses                  \n                Average                       \n                interest-bea\u2026                 \n                deposits                      \n                Average                       \n                noninterest-\u2026                 \n                deposits                      \n                Assets under                  \n                administrati\u2026                 \n                Mortgage                      \n                origination                   \n                value                         \n  Total                                       \n  Shareholder                                 \n  Return                                      \n  (\u201cTSR\u201d)                                     \n  (measured                    One-year       \n  against peer                 Three-year     \n  group and                                   \n  the S&P                                     \n  banking                                     \n  index)                                      \n                Five-year                     \n                                              \n                  \n  *  As adjusted  \n                  \nWe also adjust some of these metrics for      \ncertain events as described in more detail    \nbeginning on page 53. In addition to these    \nmetrics, the Committee measures our progress  \nagainst strategic objectives and assesses our \nrisk management performance. The Committee    \nalso reviews detailed breakdowns of diversity \nrepresentations and talent trends throughout  \neach level of our workforce. In determining   \nthe amount of incentive awards against the    \nincentive compensation targets, the Committee \nmay consider these performance metrics without\nassigning a specific weight or formula to any \non metric. Incentive compensation program The \nincentive compensation target includes two    \ncomponents: an annual incentive award payable \nin cash and a long-term incentive award that  \nis equity-based and granted in two different  \nforms (PSUs and RSUs). After the performance  \nyear ends, the Committee evaluates PNC\u2019s      \naggregate performance for the year, as well as\nthe individual performance of each NEO, and   \ndetermines an incentive compensation amount to\nbe awarded to each executive, expressed as a  \npercentage of the incentive compensation      \ntarget set at the beginning of the performance\nyear.                                         \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             49  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Once the \nCommittee determines the final incentive      \ncompensation amount, it is divided between the\nannual cash incentive and the long-term       \nequity-based incentive. The long-term         \nincentive award makes up at least 50% of the  \nvalue of the total compensation awarded to the\nNEO. Ms. Larrimer retired in 2022 and did not \nreceive a long-term incentive award for the   \n2022 performance year. Although not a part of \nour annual incentive compensation program, as \npreviously disclosed, the Committee also      \ngranted Leadership Continuity Awards in the   \nform of performance-based restricted share    \nunits (\u201cPRSUs\u201d) to three NEOs (Mr. Reilly, Mr.\nLyons and Mr. Parsley) during the second      \nquarter of 2022. The Committee did not grant a\nLeadership Continuity Award to Mr. Demchak,   \nour CEO, or to Ms. Larrimer or Mr. Jordan. The\nLeadership Continuity Awards are described on \npage 60. The Committee\u2019s evaluation of 2022   \nperformance and the related compensation      \ndecisions made by the Committee for each NEO  \nare described on pages 53 to 62. Long-term    \nincentive award (equity-based).The long-term  \nincentive is equity-based and granted through \ntwo separate awards \u2014 PSUs and RSUs. The      \nCommittee made these grants to NEOs in the    \nfirst quarter of 2023 (for 2022 performance)  \nand in the first quarter of 2022 (for 2021    \nperformance). Ms. Larrimer retired in 2022 and\ndid not receive a long-term incentive award   \nfor the 2022 performance year. These awards,  \nand all other equity-based awards, are made   \nunder PNC\u2019s shareholder-approved 2016         \nIncentive Award Plan.

The payout is based on how  \nPNC performs against two corporate performance\nmetrics over a three-year performance period. \nPerformance against these two metrics         \ngenerates a percentage (the corporate         \nperformance factor). The award may be         \ndecreased if PNC fails to satisfy a risk      \nperformance metric or based on a discretionary\nrisk performance review conducted by the      \nCommittee. After applying any risk-related    \nperformance adjustment (and if PNC satisfies  \nthe risk performance metric), the resulting   \npercentage is applied to the number of target \nPSUs to determine the final number of units   \navailable for settlement. The PSUs have a     \nmaximum payout opportunity of 150% of target. \nPayout of any award under the PSUs also       \nrequires the satisfaction of service          \nrequirements and other award conditions. The  \nCommittee may also increase or decrease the   \nsize of the final payout to maintain the      \nintended economics of the award if            \ncircumstances change. These circumstances     \ninclude external events affecting PNC or      \nmembers of its peer group or its financial    \nstatements that are outside of PNC\u2019s control  \nand not reasonably anticipated. The two       \ncorporate performance metrics include an      \nabsolute metric (an internal PNC measurement  \nagainst a target) and a relative metric (PNC  \nperformance against our peer group). The      \nabsolute metric is PNC\u2019s three-year average   \nreturn on equity (\u201cROE\u201d), as adjusted,        \ncompared to three-year ROE performance targets\nestablished in advance by the Committee. The  \nrelative metric is PNC\u2019s three-year average   \nEPS growth, as adjusted, compared to the      \nthree-year average EPS growth of our peer     \ngroup. The ROE metric, as adjusted, will be   \ncalculated annually for each year of the      \nperformance period. At the end of the three-  \nyear performance period, average ROE for the  \nperformance period will be determined as the  \naverage of PNC\u2019s annual ROE for each year. In \nestablishing the ROE performance targets, the \nCommittee considers multiple factors,         \nincluding our historical performance, budget  \nand future growth expectations, peer group    \nresults, cost of capital and analyst          \nexpectations. The EPS growth metric, as       \nadjusted, will be calculated for each year of \nthe performance period. At the end of the     \nthree-year performance period, the annual EPS \ngrowth percentages will be averaged. PNC\u2019s    \nthree-year average EPS growth will be compared\nto the three-year average of each member of   \nour peer group to determine our percentile    \nrank.                                         \n                                              \n  50    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Once     \nPNC\u2019s percentile rank relating to average EPS \ngrowth, as adjusted, and PNC\u2019s average ROE, as\nadjusted, are determined for purposes of the  \ngrants, the corporate performance factor,     \nranging from 0\u2013150%, will be calculated using \nthe grid below and applying bilinear          \ninterpolation. The chart below shows the      \ncorporate performance metrics for the 2023 PSU\ngrants (the corporate performance metrics for \nthe 2022 grants were disclosed in last year\u2019s \nproxy statement). For the 2023 PSU grants, the\nCommittee maintained the three-year average   \nROE performance range of 8%-13%, but increased\neach of the levels within that range by 75    \nbasis points from last year. The Committee    \napproved this grid based on the overall       \neconomic environment and PNC\u2019s risk appetite, \nas well as an analysis of PNC\u2019s cost of       \ncapital and a multi-year pro forma analysis of\nROE.                                          \n                                              \n      20\u2026                 Th\u2026                 \n      PSU                 av\u2026                 \n      Aw\u2026                 EPS                 \n      (2\u2026                 gr\u2026                 \n      Pe\u2026                 as                  \n      Pe\u2026                 ad\u2026                 \n                          (r\u2026                 \n      PNC                 PNC                 \n      pe\u2026       PNC       pe\u2026                 \n      ra\u2026       pe\u2026       ra\u2026                 \n      (2\u2026       ra\u2026       (7\u2026                 \n      pe\u2026       (5\u2026       pe\u2026                 \n      or        pe\u2026       or                  \n      be\u2026                 ab\u2026                 \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026       13\u2026       10\u2026       12\u2026       15\u2026  \n  as                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n      12\u2026       87\u2026       11\u2026       13\u2026       \n      11\u2026       75\u2026       10\u2026       12\u2026       \n      10\u2026       62\u2026       87\u2026       10\u2026       \n      8.\u2026       50\u2026       75\u2026       87\u2026       \n      Be\u2026       0.\u2026       25\u2026       50\u2026       \n                                              \nWhen calculating our adjusted average ROE and \nEPS growth for this award, consistent with our\nprior awards, we will reverse the after-      \ntaximpact of our provision for credit losses \u2014\nthat is, we will add back the provision amount\nto our reported net income. We will then      \nsubtract total net charge-offs from the net   \nincome amount and adjust net income for the   \nchange in taxes. Net charge-offs represent the\namount of a loan (or portion of a loan) that  \nwe remove from our balance sheet because we   \ndeem it to be uncollectible, less any         \nrecoveries. We expect this adjusted ROE and   \nEPS growth to present a more accurate         \nmeasurement of how efficiently we create      \nprofit, as it replaces our estimated credit   \nlosses (provision) with the actual losses we  \nincur (net charge-offs). Adjustments will also\nbe made on an after-taxbasis for the impact to\nPNC and the companies in our peer group, as   \nappropriate, of items resulting from changes  \nin federal tax law, discontinued operations   \n(as such term is used under GAAP), and any    \nacquisition costs and merger integration      \ncosts. RSUs.With respect to 2022 performance, \nin early 2023 the Committee also granted to   \ncertain of our senior executives, including   \nall NEOs (except for Ms. Larrimer), RSUs that \nrepresent an opportunity to receive shares of \nPNC common stock. The RSUs vest pro rata over \nthree years, with each of the three annual    \ninstallments (tranches) vesting on the        \nanniversary of the grant date (or if later,   \nthe date the Committee determines that all    \nrisk conditions have been satisfied). Vesting \nalso requires the satisfaction of service     \nrequirements and other award conditions.      \nAdditional provisions for PSUs and RSUs.The   \nprovisions described in this section apply to \nboth of our long-term incentive awards \u2014 the  \nPSUs and the RSUs. Risk-based performance     \nreviews.All long-term incentive awards are    \nsubject to risk-based performance reviews. The\nprimary risk-based metric measured as part of \nthis review is the Basel III common equity    \nTier 1 capital ratio (the \u201cCET1 Ratio\u201d). PNC  \nmust maintain a minimum capital ratio of 4.5%,\nplus an additional capital stress buffer. At  \nthe end of the performance year, the minimum  \nrequired CET1 Ratio was 7.4%. For PSUs, for   \neach year during the three-year performance   \nperiod that PNC fails to meet the CET1 Ratio, \none-thirdof the target number of PSUs granted \nwill be eligible for forfeiture. After the    \nthree-year performance period ends, the       \nCommittee will conduct a final performance    \nreview and may reduce the number of target    \nshares available for payout if PNC did not    \nmeet the CET1 Ratio for one or more years     \nduring the performance period. For RSUs, each \nRSU tranche is subject to the same risk-      \nrelated performance metric that will be       \napplied to the PSUs, with all or a portion of \nthat tranche being eligible for forfeiture.   \nAfter the year ends, the Committee will       \nconduct a risk-based performance review and   \nmay decrease the number of shares available   \nfor payout under the applicable RSU tranche if\nPNC did not meet the CET1 Ratio as of the end \nof the most recent year before the vesting    \ndate of that tranche. In addition, and        \nindependent from the evaluation of the CET1   \nRatio, the Committee may conduct another risk \nperformance review for the PSUs and the RSUs. \nThis discretionary review would generally     \noccur in connection with a risk-related action\nof potentially material consequence to PNC. If\nthe Committee exercises its discretion to     \nconduct a risk performance review, the        \nCommittee will review and determine if a      \nreduction to the corporate performance factor \nfor risk performance is appropriate for the   \nPSUs or if a reduction for risk performance is\nappropriate for the applicable RSU tranche.   \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             51  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \nDividends.Both the PSUs and the RSUs will     \naccrue cash dividend equivalents during their \nrespective performance periods. For the PSUs, \nthe accrued dividend equivalents will be      \nadjusted by the same percentage as the target \nPSUs at the time of payout and will then be   \npaid out in cash. For the RSUs, the accrued   \ndividend equivalents with respect to a tranche\nwill pay out in cash at the same time, and    \nwill be adjusted by the same payout           \npercentage, as the RSUs to which they relate. \nOther compensation and benefits In addition to\nthe components included in the total          \ncompensation target outlined above, our       \nexecutive compensation program also includes  \nlimited perquisites (to increase efficiency   \nand focus on our business), change in control \narrangements (for continuity of management in \nconnection with a potential change in control)\nand health and retirement plans (to promote   \nhealth and wellness and post-retirement       \nfinancial security).

When establishing the  \ntotal compensation targets for 2022, the      \nCommittee reviewed available market data with \nMeridian, its independent compensation        \nconsultant, and members of management.        \nFollowing consultation with Meridian and      \nmembers of management, the Committee increased\n2022 total compensation targets for the       \nfollowing NEOs: Mr. Demchak (from $14,200,000 \nto $17,000,000); Mr. Reilly (from $4,800,000  \nto $5,500,000); Mr. Lyons (from $8,000,000 to \n$9,000,000); and Mr. Parsley (from $8,000,000 \nto $8,500,000). The Committee increased the   \ntotal compensation targets for these NEOs     \nbased on their performance and demonstrated   \nability to execute against our strategic      \nobjectives, the desire for executive          \nleadership stability and retention in a       \ndynamic market for external talent, and market\ndata for similarly situated positions. 2022   \nperformance At meetings held during the first \nquarter of 2023, the Committee reviewed PNC\u2019s \n2022 performance with the CEO, the Chief Risk \nOfficer and other members of management. In   \nevaluating performance and determining        \nincentive compensation awards for our NEOs,   \nthe Committee may consider several metrics,   \nwithout assigning a particular weight to any  \none metric. To evaluate our 2022 performance, \nthe Committee reviewed our performance against\nthe range of metrics described on page 49,    \nincluding the selected performance metrics    \nidentified in the table below. As noted above,\nthe Committee reviews our results on the six  \nfinancial performance metrics in the table    \nbelow relative to both budget and the prior   \nyear\u2019s results, along with other key metrics  \nthat are generally evaluated relative to the  \nprior year\u2019s results.                         \n                                              \n                           20\u2026        2\u2026      \n  F\u2026    2\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026    re\u2026        r\u2026      \n  p\u2026    r\u2026    bu\u2026    r\u2026    vs.        v\u2026      \n  m\u2026                       20\u2026        2\u2026      \n                           bu\u2026        r\u2026      \n  N\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    $\u2026    $1\u2026    $\u2026    +5\u2026        +\u2026      \n  (\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    $\u2026    $8\u2026    $\u2026    -6\u2026        -\u2026      \n  (\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026    $\u2026    $1\u2026    $\u2026    +2\u2026        +\u2026      \n  E\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026    1\u2026    9.\u2026    9\u2026    +3\u2026        +\u2026      \n         %      %     %                       \n  R\u2026    1\u2026    0.\u2026    1\u2026    +2\u2026        +\u2026      \n         %      %     %                       \n  R\u2026    6\u2026    64\u2026    6\u2026                       \n  e\u2026     %      %     %    -0\u2026  -2    +\u2026  -2  \n  r\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026                                          \n  k\u2026    2\u2026           2\u2026                       \n  p\u2026    r\u2026           r\u2026                       \n  m\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026    $\u2026           $\u2026                       \n  (\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  b\u2026                                          \n  v\u2026    $\u2026           $\u2026                       \n  p\u2026                                          \n  s\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026                                          \n  t\u2026    (\u2026           3\u2026                       \n  s\u2026                  %                       \n  r\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026    9\u2026           1\u2026                       \n  R\u2026     %            %                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     These metrics, as adjusted, are          \n     non-GAAP financial measure.

Against the 2022      \nbudget, PNC exceeded expectations for net     \ninterest income, adjusted EPS, adjusted ROA   \nand adjusted ROE, and was close to            \nexpectations on risk-adjusted efficiency      \nratio. PNC underperformed slightly against    \nbudget for adjusted noninterest income,       \nreflecting reduced activity in market-        \nsensitive businesses. Compared to last year\u2019s \nresults, PNC increased net interest income,   \nadjusted EPS, adjusted ROA and adjusted ROE,  \nwhile improving its risk-adjusted efficiency  \nratio and underperforming against adjusted    \nnoninterest income. The Committee discussed   \nthe change in tangible book value from the    \nprior year, and concluded that the reduction  \ndid not reflect underlying business           \nperformance but was due to the accounting     \ntreatment of securities held by PNC during a  \nrapidly rising interest rate environment. As a\nresult, the Committee believed that the change\nin tangible book value should not materially  \naffect its evaluation of 2022 performance or  \nrelated incentive compensation decisions. The \nCommittee also considered PNC\u2019s consistent    \nability to deliver strong long-term value to  \nshareholders, with three-yearand five-        \nyeartotal shareholder returns ranking 4th in  \nour peer group and a one-yearTSR above the    \nmedian. The Committee noted that despite being\nabove the peer median, one-yearTSR was        \nnegative for 2022. The Committee compared     \nother key financial metrics to our peers,     \nnoting that PNC was 3rd in the peer group for \nadjusted EPS growth, 5th for adjusted         \nnoninterest income, 6th for net interest      \nincome, and below the peer group median for   \nadjusted ROA, adjusted ROE and risk-adjusted  \nefficiency ratio.                             \n                                              \n  54    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS In       \naddition to a review of key financial metrics,\nthe Committee also reviewed PNC\u2019s performance \nagainst the three Board-reviewed strategic    \npriorities listed below.

The CEO   \ndiscussed the individual performance of the   \nother NEOs with the Committee and, where      \nappropriate, discussed the performance of the \nlines of business or functions managed by the \nNEOs. The Committee approved compensation for \neach NEO based on an evaluation of corporate, \nbusiness and individual performance. The      \nCommittee discussed compensation              \nrecommendations for the CEO with Meridian, the\nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation          \nconsultant for 2022, our Chief Human Resources\nOfficer, and our Head of Executive            \nCompensation. Other than the secretary for the\nmeeting, no other members of management were  \npresent. Following this discussion, the       \nCommittee approved the compensation for our   \nCEO in an executive session. The Committee    \nalso reviewed the CEO compensation decisions  \nin an executive session of the independent    \nmembers of the Board, with no members of      \nmanagement present. In that executive session,\nthe Committee allowed time for the independent\ndirectors to provide comments or questions    \nabout the CEO\u2019s performance or compensation.  \n2022 compensation decisions Based on a        \ncomprehensive evaluation of PNC\u2019s 2022        \nperformance, as described above, the Committee\ndetermined that it was appropriate to award   \nincentive compensation that was at, or close  \nto, the target amount for each NEO. Ms.       \nLarrimer received an annual cash incentive    \namount at target, but in light of her         \nretirement in 2022, she did not receive a     \nlong-term equity-based incentive award. The   \nCommittee focused on PNC\u2019s record revenue,    \nincreased loans, strong EPS growth, successful\nexpansion in new markets and management\u2019s     \ncontinued successful achievement against      \nstrategic objectives. The Committee also      \nconsidered long-term shareholder value        \ncreation, noting that three-yearand five-     \nyeartotal shareholder returns ranked 4th in   \nour peer group and that one-year TSR, although\nnegative, outperformed our peer group. While  \nthe Committee believed that our financial     \nmetrics were strong when compared to 2021     \nresults and our 2022 budget, and that PNC     \ngenerally performed well against its peers,   \nthe Committee believed that it was appropriate\nto award incentive compensation at            \napproximately the target amount. The total    \ncompensation awarded to our CEO was down 15%  \nfrom the compensation he received last year,  \nand each of our other NEOs (except for Ms.    \nLarrimer, who retired in 2022) received total \ncompensation that represented a decline of    \napproximately 15% to 19%. As CEO,             \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             55  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Mr.      \nDemchak received 75% of his total annual      \ncompensation for 2022 in the form of long-term\nequity-based incentive awards, with each of   \nthe other NEOs, other than Ms. Larrimer,      \nreceiving between 50-60%of total annual       \ncompensation for 2022 in the form of long-term\nequity-based incentive awards. For Mr. Reilly,\nMr. Lyons and Mr. Parsley, the percentage of  \nlong-term equity-based incentive awards would \nincrease if the Leadership Continuity Awards  \ngranted in June 2022 were included. For each  \nof our NEOs, the table below compares the     \nincentive compensation target to the actual   \nincentive compensation awarded for the 2022   \nperformance year. Under SEC regulations, the  \nincentive compensation awarded for 2022       \nperformance differs from what we disclose in  \nthe Summary compensation table on page 71. The\nSEC requires us to include incentive awards   \nfrom two different performance years: the     \nannual cash incentive award based on 2022     \nperformance (and paid in 2023) and the long-  \nterm equity-based incentive award based on    \n2021 performance (and awarded in 2022). The   \nlong-term equity-based incentive award based  \non 2022 performance (and awarded in 2023) will\nbe included in next year\u2019s Summary            \ncompensation table. For Mr. Reilly, Mr. Lyons \nand Mr. Parsley, this year\u2019s Summary          \ncompensation table also includes, for 2022,   \nthe grant date fair value of the Leadership   \nContinuity Award granted to each of those NEOs\nand described in more detail on page 71. We   \nexclude the grant date fair value of these    \nLeadership Continuity Awards from the table   \nbelow. We believe the table below, when read  \nin conjunction with the Summary compensation  \ntable on page 71, more clearly shows the      \nactual compensation decisions made by the     \nCommittee for the 2022 performance year.      \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Because Ms. Larrimer retired in 2022,    \n  *  she did not receive a long-term          \n     equity-based incentive award.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Under SEC regulations, the incentive   \n       compensation amounts disclosed in the  \n       Summary compensation table on page 71  \n       include the annual cash incentive      \n       award paid in 2023 for 2022            \n       performance (the \u201cNon-Equity           \n       Incentive Plan Compensation\u201d column)   \n       and the long-term equity-based         \n       incentive award granted in 2022 for    \n       2021 performance (the \u201cStock Awards\u201d   \n       column).

The Committee did not grant a         \nLeadership Continuity Award to Mr. Demchak,   \nour CEO, or to Ms. Larrimer or Mr. Jordan. The\nLeadership Continuity Awards were designed to \naddress the following specific objectives:    \n                                              \n  Ensuring leadership continuity to support   \n  Mr.                                         \n  Demchak as he continues to execute PNC\u2019s    \n  strategic                                   \n  priorities over the next several years.     \n  Retaining senior leadership in a highly     \n  competitive environment.                    \n  Strengthening the alignment between         \n  executive                                   \n  compensation and long-term shareholder      \n  value                                       \n  creation.                                   \n                                              \nTo help achieve these objectives, the         \nLeadership Continuity Awards will not pay out \nfor five years and any payouts will be tied to\nhow well PNC performs against its peer group. \nThe performance period for the awards will run\nfor five years (from June 2022 to June 2027)  \nand the awards will pay out based on how PNC\u2019s\nTSR compares to the peer group described on   \npage 63:                                      \n                                              \n  Percentile\u00a0                                 \n  Performance\u00a0of\u00a0         Payout\u00a0Opportunity  \n  Relative\u00a0TSR                                \n  \u2264 25th percentile       75%                 \n  50th percentile         100%                \n  \u2265 75th percentile       125%                \n                                              \nBased on PNC\u2019s relative TSR, the maximum      \npayout percentage may not exceed 125% of the  \ntarget award, as described in the chart above.\nWe will use interpolation for payout purposes \nif relative TSR performance falls in between  \nthe percentiles listed above. If PNC\u2019s        \nabsolute TSR is negative at the end of the    \nperformance period, the maximum payout        \npercentage may not exceed 100%. The awards are\nalso subject to the same risk performance     \nmetrics and review of risk-related performance\nas described above for the 2022 PSUs. At its  \ndiscretion, the Committee may reduce the      \noverall payout percentage of the Leadership   \nContinuity Award, including reducing the      \npayout percentage to zero, based on the       \nexecutive\u2019s individual performance. The       \nCommittee does not have discretion to increase\nthe payout percentage. The Committee          \ndetermined the number of Leadership Continuity\nAwards granted to the three NEOs by dividing  \nthe dollar value of the applicable award by   \nthe closing price of a share of our common    \nstock on the grant date ($155.53 per share).  \nThe Committee determined that it would be     \nappropriate for each target grant amount to   \napproximate one year of total compensation for\nthe NEO, with the target value for each award \nbetween 1.0x and 1.2x of the NEO\u2019s 2022 total \ncompensation target. The dollar value of the  \ntarget award grant and number of awards (at   \ntarget) for each NEO was:                     \n                                              \n                 Dollar\u00a0           Number\u00a0of  \n                 Value\u00a0of\u00a0        Leadership  \n                 Grant            Continuity  \n                 (At Target)      Awards (At  \n                                     Target)  \n  Michael P.     $10.8\u00a0               69,440  \n  Lyons          million                      \n  E William      $10.2\u00a0                       \n  Parsley,       million              65,583  \n  III                                         \n  Robert Q.      $5.5\u00a0                35,363  \n  Reilly         million                      \n                                              \nAny amounts earned under the Leadership       \nContinuity Award will be settled in shares of \nour common stock, along with any dividend     \nequivalent rights that have accrued during the\nperformance period (payable in cash).

The RSUs vest in annual installments    \nover three years. At a meeting held on January\n30, 2023, the Committee determined that the   \nrisk-based performance criteria had been      \nsatisfied for the 2022 tranche of each of the \noutstanding RSU grants awarded to the NEOs in \n2020, 2021 and 2022, and those tranches vested\n100%. PSUs. The PSUs vest based on performance\nover a three-year period. At a meeting held on\nFebruary 16, 2023, the Committee determined   \nthat the PSU grants awarded to each NEO in    \n2020 had vested and that the risk performance \ncriteria had been satisfied. The Committee    \napproved a payout of 111.91% for the 2020     \naward. Under the terms of the award, the      \nCommittee reviews PNC\u2019s ROE and EPS growth for\neach year of the three-year performance       \nperiod. We adjust these two metrics, as       \nappropriate, for certain items, including     \ndiscontinued operations (under GAAP),         \nacquisition costs and merger integration      \ncosts, the net impact to PNC of significant   \ngains or losses related to BlackRock          \ntransactions, and changes in U.S. federal tax \nlaw. Once the performance period ends, we take\nthe average of each metric over the three-year\nperiod to determine an overall corporate      \nperformance factor. We compare our average    \nannual ROE to previously disclosed performance\ntargets and compare our average year-over-year\nEPS growth to our peer group, consistent with \nthe grid below:                               \n                                              \n           20\u2026            Th\u2026                 \n           PSU            av\u2026                 \n           Aw\u2026            EPS                 \n           (2\u2026            gr\u2026                 \n           Pe\u2026            as                  \n           Pe\u2026            ad\u2026                 \n                          (r\u2026                 \n                PNC                 PNC       \n                pe\u2026       PNC       pe\u2026       \n                ra\u2026       pe\u2026       ra\u2026       \n                (2\u2026       ra\u2026       (7\u2026       \n                pe\u2026       (5\u2026       pe\u2026       \n                or        pe\u2026       or        \n                be\u2026                 ab\u2026       \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026       13\u2026       10\u2026       12\u2026       15\u2026  \n  as                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n      12\u2026       87\u2026       11\u2026       13\u2026       \n      11\u2026       75\u2026       10\u2026       12\u2026       \n      10\u2026       62\u2026       87\u2026       10\u2026       \n      8.\u2026       50\u2026       75\u2026       87\u2026       \n      Be\u2026       0.\u2026       25\u2026       50\u2026       \n                                              \nThe Committee may also consider other unusual \nor nonrecurring adjustments in determining the\ncorporate performance factor and final payout \npercentage. In addition, the Committee may    \nreduce or increase the payout under the award \nto maintain the intended economics of the     \naward in light of changed circumstances \u2014     \nmeaning external events affecting PNC, its    \nfinancial statements or members of its peer   \ngroup that are substantially outside of PNC\u2019s \ncontrol and could not reasonably be planned   \nfor as of the grant date. When considering the\npayout for the 2020 PSU awards, the Committee \nnoted PNC\u2019s strong performance and            \nmanagement\u2019s success in creating long-term    \nshareholder value over the three-year PSU     \nperformance period. The Committee highlighted \nPNC\u2019s outstanding total shareholder returns,  \nwhich ranked 4th in our peer group for both   \nthe three-year and five-year periods. The     \nCommittee took into consideration how two     \nsignificant accomplishments during the        \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             61  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \nperformance period \u2014 the sale of PNC\u2019s equity \ninvestment in BlackRock in 2020 followed by   \nthe acquisition of BBVA USA in 2021 and the   \nrelated successful expansion into new markets \nthroughout 2022 \u2014 greatly contributed to PNC\u2019s\nexcellent performance and shareholder value   \ncreation. The strategic sale of PNC\u2019s 22.4%   \nequity investment in BlackRock in May 2020    \nresulted in sizable net proceeds to PNC of    \n$14.2 billion and an after-taxgain of $4.3    \nbillion. The acquisition of BBVA USA, which we\nannounced in November 2020 and closed in 2021,\nsuccessfully redeployed the excess BlackRock  \ncapital. From a strategic and operational     \nperspective, the Committee recognized that    \nselling our outstanding equity investment in  \nBlackRock and then closing and converting an  \ninstitution the size of BBVA USA in 11 months \n\u2014 while continuing to navigate a global       \npandemic and retaining key executive talent \u2014 \nrepresented a remarkable accomplishment. The  \nCommittee also discussed how the financial    \naccounting treatment of these transactions    \nboth positively and negatively affected       \naverage ROE and average EPS growth, the two   \nPSU performance metrics. The BlackRock sale   \ngenerated a significant amount of surplus     \ncapital that could not be immediately         \nredeployed, and also eliminated any recurring \nincome we would otherwise have received from  \nour equity investment. In addition, the PSU   \nagreement required us to adjust the metrics   \nfor discontinued operations (under GAAP),     \nwhich eliminated the $4.3 billion gain on sale\nof the BlackRock equity. As a result, the sale\nof our BlackRock investment significantly     \nreduced both of our PSU performance metrics in\n2020 and 2021. In light of this, the Committee\nfurther evaluated the two performance metrics.\nThe Committee adjusted average ROE and average\nEPS growth over the performance period to     \nremove the financial accounting impact of the \nBlackRock transaction. These adjustments      \neliminated the net book value of the BlackRock\nequity investment, which removed the excess,  \nundeployed capital, but also eliminated the   \nlarge gain on the sale of the equity and the  \nincome derived from BlackRock during the      \nperformance period. These adjustments resulted\nin a payout percentage of 128.88%. Without    \nthese adjustments, the formulaic payout       \npercentage for the PSUs was 94.94%. The       \nCommittee considered PNC\u2019s overall performance\nover the three-year period, the benefits of   \ndivesting our passive BlackRock investment and\nstrategically and quickly redeploying the     \ncapital by acquiring BBVA USA and expanding   \ninto new markets, successfully creating a     \ncoast-to-coastfranchise. In evaluating the    \noverall accounting impact of the BlackRock    \ntransaction, the Committee considered the     \ncompeting financial effects of excess capital \nthat could not be immediately redeployed, a   \nsignificant gain on the sale of equity, and   \nthe loss of a recurring income stream. The    \nCommittee concluded that the long-term        \nstrategic benefits from the BlackRock equity  \nsale and successful and rapid acquisition and \nconversion of BBVA USA outweighed any         \ntemporary (and expected) accounting impact on \nROE and EPS growth. In the Committee\u2019s view,  \nthe payout percentage should be above target  \nto reward management for achieving three-year \nand five-year total shareholder returns that  \nranked 4th in our peer group, and executing on\nstrategic plans to realize PNC\u2019s longer-term  \nobjectives, while also building up temporary  \ncapital during an uncertain economic          \nenvironment. The Committee believed that      \nlooking at the two performance metrics on both\na formulaic and fully adjusted basis provided \nhelpful context and boundaries for the payout \ndecision. Based on this analysis, the         \nCommittee reduced the fully adjusted payout   \npercentage for the 2020 PSU award to 111.91%, \nwhich averaged the unadjusted and fully       \nadjusted payout percentages, recognizing only \na portion of the fully adjusted results. The  \nCommittee believed that this payout           \nappropriately valued PNC\u2019s three-year         \nperformance during a complex and unprecedented\nperiod of time, and rewarded management for   \nthe successful execution of strategic         \nobjectives, and significant growth in new     \nmarkets from 2020 through 2022. Compensation  \npolicies and practices The Committee adopts   \npolicies and procedures to assist in the      \nfulfillment of its duties, and we describe    \nsome of the significant policies and          \nprocedures in this section. In addition to    \nformal policies and procedures, the Committee \nhas several practices that it follows in the  \nfulfillment of its duties and                 \nresponsibilities. Some of those practices are \ndescribed below. Compensation and risk The    \nCommittee evaluates the risks inherent in the \nincentive compensation program. For a detailed\ndiscussion of how the Committee evaluates     \nrisk, see Compensation and Riskbeginning on   \npage 69. Independent compensation consultant  \nThe Committee retains Meridian Compensation   \nPartners, LLC as its independent compensation \nconsultant.

We use this group to help measure       \nrelative performance and to determine payouts \nunder our long-term incentive awards. We also \nuse this group for general compensation       \ncomparisons. In approving a peer group, the   \nCommittee analyzes several factors, including \nthe mix and complexity of businesses, the     \nmarkets being served, market capitalization,  \nasset size and changes resulting from mergers \nor shifts in strategic direction. We also look\nat the companies with whom we generally       \ncompete for talent. Each year, the Committee  \nreviews the composition of the peer group with\nmanagement and its independent compensation   \nconsultant. For 2022, the Committee believed  \nthat the existing peer group generally        \nprovided a balanced mix of institutions       \nconsidering our size, mix and scope of        \nbusinesses, products and services, and sources\nof executive talent.

Each executive officer must meet      \nadditional ownership requirements, even after \nmeeting the original ownership target. The    \nownership requirements increase the number of \nPNC shares that an individual must own over   \ntime with an ongoing retention requirement.   \nThis retention requirement provides that as   \nnew equity awards vest, designated executives \nmust retain a percentage of the stock, which  \nthey must generally hold until they retire or \nleave PNC. This ownership policy reflects     \ncompensation awards over an executive\u2019s career\nand ties an executive\u2019s personal wealth       \nclosely to the long-term performance of PNC   \nand the interests of our shareholders. Equity \ninterests that count toward satisfaction of   \nthe ownership guidelines include shares owned \noutright by the officer, or his or her spouse \nand dependent children, restricted shares     \n(subject to time-vesting requirements),       \ncertain equity awards and shares or stock     \nunits held in a benefit plan.

The Committee retains    \ndiscretion, to the extent legally permissible,\nto determine that it would not be in PNC\u2019s    \nbest interests to seek to enforce the         \nclawback. For purposes of the negative        \nadjustment resulting from risk-related        \nactions, the Committee may reduce or cancel   \nunvested long-term incentive compensation     \ngranted to an employee who takes action (or   \nfails to take action) that results in, or is  \nreasonably expected to result in, a material  \nadverse impact to PNC or a business unit, such\nas:                                           \n                                              \n  \u2022    Not following applicable risk          \n       management policies or procedures;     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disregarding the significant risks     \n  \u2022    associated with a course of action     \n       for which the employee is              \n       responsible;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Violating (or permitting or enabling   \n  \u2022    PNC to violate) statutory or           \n       regulatory requirements; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Not escalating risk concerns to        \n  \u2022    appropriate individuals, committees    \n       or other governing bodies.             \n                                              \nThis applies to individual employees who took \nrisk-related actions (or failed to act) and   \ntheir supervisors. The types of adverse       \nimpacts could include matters such as impacts \nto the financial performance, capital or      \nliquidity positions, reputation or business   \nprospects of PNC or a business segment or     \ncorporate function within PNC. The negative   \nadjustment resulting from risk-related actions\nallows PNC to recoup unvested equity awards   \nfrom recipients whose inappropriate risk-     \ntaking activities have resulted in, or are    \nexpected to result in, a material adverse     \nimpact to PNC in the future. By doing so, we  \ncan further balance the risks in our incentive\narrangements by accounting for both forward-  \nand backward-looking risk adjustments. The    \npolicy provides that if PNC applies the policy\nto recoup or clawback incentive compensation  \nor negatively adjust incentive compensation as\na result of risk-related actions and the      \nunderlying factual circumstances are otherwise\npublicly reported by PNC in a filing with the \nSEC or in disclosure that would otherwise meet\nthe requirements for public disclosure by PNC \nunder the SEC\u2019s Regulation FD, or are         \ndisclosed by a third party in a publicly      \navailable court or administrative filing, then\nPNC will disclose in the proxy statement for  \nits annual shareholder meeting, a current     \nreport on Form 8-Kor other public filing made \nby it with the SEC or a posting in a clearly  \nidentifiable location in the Investor         \nRelations section of its corporate website:   \n                                              \n       a general description of the           \n       circumstances giving rise to the       \n       incentive compensation recovery or     \n  \u2022    adjustment, including items such as    \n       the number of employees, seniority of  \n       employees and line of business         \n       impacted; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    the aggregate amount of incentive      \n       compensation recovered or adjusted.    \n                                              \n                                              \n  64    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PNC may  \nlimit such disclosure if it would be likely to\nresult in, or exacerbate, any existing or     \nthreatened employee, shareholder or other     \nlitigation, arbitration or proceeding against \nPNC. Approval of severance agreements We have \na Board-approved policy regarding shareholder \napproval of future severance arrangements.    \nUnder this policy, PNC will not enter into an \narrangement with an executive officer that    \nprovides for additional severance benefits in \nan amount exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the \nexecutive officer\u2019s annual base salary and    \ntarget bonus for the year of termination,     \nunless the future severance arrangement is    \napproved by the affirmative vote of a majority\nof votes cast by shareholders on the matter.  \nThe Board retains the right to amend,         \nterminate or waive the policy and will        \npromptly disclose any such change. We have    \nmade this policy available in the Governance  \nDocuments section of                          \nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. None of our  \nchange of control agreements contain any      \nexcise tax \u201cgross-up\u201dprovisions. For a more   \ndetailed discussion on change of control      \nagreements, see Change in Control and         \nTermination of Employment\u2014Change of control   \nagreementson page 83. Limiting perquisites The\nCommittee believes in limiting the number and \nvalue of perquisites provided to our          \nexecutives. We consider a benefit to be a     \nperquisite or personal benefit unless its     \npurpose is clearly and exclusively business-  \nrelated. We determine the value of perquisites\nbased on their incremental cost to us. The    \nprincipal perquisites we may provide to our   \nexecutive officers include financial          \nconsulting and tax preparation services and   \nlimited personal use of corporate aircraft.   \nThe perquisites we provide to our executive   \nofficers under the program do not include any \ntax \u201cgross ups.\u201d Some of our executive        \nofficers participate in benefit programs or   \nreceive perquisites that we no longer offer to\ncurrent executives, including two NEOs who    \nremain eligible to receive executive          \nphysicals. In 2022, Mr. Demchak also received \na one-timereimbursement for expenses          \nassociated with regulatory fees and related   \nlegal and accounting expenses in connection   \nwith required filings under the Hart-Scott-   \nRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. We \ninclude the amount of this reimbursement in   \nthe \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column of the    \nSummary compensation table on page 71. Certain\nexecutives, including all currently employed  \nNEOs (other than our CEO), receive a $10,000  \nallowance for personal aircraft usage. As the \nCommittee has previously recommended that our \nCEO take all flights (personal or business) on\nthe corporate aircraft, the Committee has     \napproved an allowance not to exceed $100,000  \nfor personal flights taken on the corporate   \naircraft by our CEO. The cost of any personal \nflights taken on the corporate aircraft that  \nexceed the applicable allowance are reimbursed\nby the executive pursuant to the terms of a   \ntime sharing agreement between the executive  \nand PNC. Due to certain operational           \nrestrictions and administrative efficiencies, \nwe operate our corporate aircraft under       \nFederal Aviation Administration rules and     \nregulations that limit our ability to accept  \nreimbursement for personal aircraft usage     \nunless an individual has a time sharing       \nagreement. The time sharing agreement provides\na mechanism to obtain reimbursement from the  \nexecutive. The costs paid by an executive     \nunder the terms of the agreement include      \nincremental costs, as well as a federal excise\ntax and other fees.

Guidelines on  \nthe use of discretion The Committee has       \nadopted guidelines on using discretion in     \nincentive compensation plans. Under these     \nguidelines, the use of discretion will be     \nexercised, when permitted under a plan, so    \nthat incentive compensation awards are        \nreasonably aligned with risk-adjusted         \nperformance. Certain plans have discretionary \nand formulaic components, while other plans   \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             65  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS are fully\ndiscretionary. For plans with both            \ndiscretionary and formulaic components, the   \nguidance provides, among other things, that a \ndiscretionary increase in otherwise           \nformulaically-determined incentive            \ncompensation should be based on behaviors,    \nactions or results that are deemed to be      \nextraordinary, exceed expectations or provide \nsignificant direct or indirect benefits to PNC\nor our businesses. At the same time, a        \ndiscretionary reduction in compensation should\nbe based on behaviors, actions or results that\nfail to meet expectations or negatively impact\nour performance, reputation or work           \nenvironment. The guidelines specifically      \naddress the need to evaluate both risk-taking \nbehaviors during the performance year, as well\nas the outcome of prior risk-taking behaviors,\nwhen making discretionary incentive           \ncompensation decisions. In addition, managers \nare generally required to document how        \ndiscretion was applied considering risk-taking\nbehaviors and outcomes in employees\u2019          \nperformance evaluations or incentive          \ncompensation recommendations, particularly for\nour most senior executives. Restrictions on   \ntrading, hedging and pledging Our Code of     \nBusiness Conduct and Ethics and related       \npolicies, which apply to our employees and    \ndirectors, include anti-hedging provisions    \nthat prohibit all employees and directors from\nday trading or short selling PNC securities   \nand from engaging in transactions in any      \nderivative of PNC securities (other than      \nsecurities issued under a PNC compensation    \nplan), including buying and writing options.  \nWe prohibit certain employees, including all  \nexecutive officers, and our directors from    \npurchasing or selling our securities beginning\nthe 16 thday of the last month of each        \ncalendar quarter until the second business day\nafter we release our earnings for that        \nquarter. We may also impose additional trading\nrestrictions on certain employees, including  \nour executive officers, and our directors due \nto the availability of material non-          \npublicinformation regarding PNC or our        \nsecurities. In addition, we require certain   \nemployees, including all executive officers,  \nto pre-clearpersonal investments (other than  \nin specified types of securities) made by them\nor any of their immediate family members.     \nAdditionally, we do not allow directors,      \nexecutive officers and certain other senior   \nemployees to pledge PNC securities. These     \nrestrictions also generally apply to immediate\nfamily members of the covered employees and   \ndirectors. Consideration of tax deductibility \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code   \ndoes not generally allow a company to deduct  \ncompensation over $1 million paid to certain  \nexecutive officers. Although the Committee    \nconsiders the deductibility of expenses when  \nit makes compensation decisions, the Committee\nbelieves in maintaining the flexibility and   \ncompetitive effectiveness of the executive    \ncompensation program. The Committee retains   \nthe discretion to establish the compensation  \npaid to the NEOs as the Committee determines  \nto be in the best interests of PNC and its    \nshareholders, and without regard to any       \nlimitation provided in Section 162(m). Tax    \ndeductibility, while an important             \nconsideration, is analyzed as one component of\nthe overall program.                          \n                                              \n  66    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Glossary \nof performance metrics This glossary describes\nsome of the performance metrics that the      \nCommittee may use to evaluate performance and \nmake compensation decisions.                  \n                                              \n                         Bank regulators      \n                         have established     \n                         risk-based and       \n                         leverage capital     \n                         ratios to evaluate   \n                         our capital          \n                         adequacy and         \n                         financial strength.  \n                         The regulatory       \n                         capital rules        \n                         establish certain    \n                         minimum              \n                         requirements for     \n                         these ratios, as     \n                         well as a capital    \n                         conservation buffer  \n                         requirement, in      \n                         order to avoid       \n                         limitations on       \n                         capital              \n                         distributions and    \n                         certain              \n                         discretionary        \n                         incentive            \n                         compensation         \n                         payments.

We also discuss \nthe risk reviews presented to the Human       \nResources Committee and the methodology we use\nto assess the potential risks in our incentive\ncompensation plans. Risk management at PNC We \nencounter risk as part of the normal course of\noperating our business. The successful        \nexecution of our strategy requires effective  \nmanagement of the risks we decide to take to  \nmaintain the trust of our customers and       \nprovide the best overall customer experience. \nWe want our decisions to reflect our desired  \nrisk appetite. It is our responsibility to    \nestablish an enterprise risk management       \nframework that facilitates risk management for\nthe benefit of our customers and shareholders.\n                                              \n  Enterprise risk appetite statement          \n  We dynamically manage our risk appetite to  \n  optimize long-term shareholder value while  \n  supporting our employees, customers, and    \n  communities.

With each of our   \nemployees, we reinforce the importance of     \nmanaging risks in executing on our strategic  \nobjectives and in support of our desired risk \nappetite. We approve our Enterprise Risk      \nManagement Framework and key risk policies at \nthe Board level. We discuss our risk          \nmanagement approach in the Risk Management    \nsection of Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form\n10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2022. We  \nreflect our desired enterprise risk appetite  \nby helping to ensure that our performance     \nmanagement and compensation arrangements for  \nall employees are balanced in ways that do not\ncreate incentives for imprudent or excessive  \nrisk-taking, are designed to provide a        \nsuperior customer experience and are          \nreflective of our business model, management  \nstructure and risk appetite. Our compensation \nphilosophy supports and reflects PNC\u2019s risk   \nappetite and risk management culture. Our risk\npolicies and procedures guide our management  \ndecisions, including how we pay employees. By \nsetting and communicating our risk appetite in\nadvance, we seek to manage and control the    \nrisks that employees can take or influence,   \nconsistent with their roles and               \nresponsibilities. All employees have          \nperformance goals tied to business and        \nindividual performance, but each employee, no \nmatter their role at PNC, also has customer   \nfocus and risk management goals. We evaluate  \nemployee performance against these goals, in  \naddition to considering risk outcomes from    \nactions taken in prior years. We incorporate  \nthis comprehensive evaluation of employee risk\nmanagement into our performance and incentive \ncompensation decisions. In addition, all      \nemployees are encouraged to collaborate across\ngroups to identify and mitigate risks and     \nelevate and address identified issues or      \nconcerns. Our compensation program is designed\nto encourage management of risk within our    \nappetite and discourage inappropriate risk-   \ntaking by granting a diverse portfolio of     \nincentive compensation awards to our          \nexecutives and other senior employees that is \nexpected to reward desired behavior over time.\nSpecifically, we balance our portfolio of     \nawards between fixed and variable             \ncompensation; cash and equity-based           \ncompensation; and annual and long-term        \ncompensation. We base awards on the           \nCommittee\u2019s assessment of a variety of        \nquantitative and qualitative performance      \nmeasurements, both on an absolute and a       \nrelative basis. Compensation decisions also   \nrely on discretion to consider                \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             69  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION AND RISK other factors, such as  \neffective risk management, delivering a       \nsuperior customer experience, compliance with \ncontrols and ethical duties, commitment to    \ndiversity and inclusion, competition for top  \ntalent, market-based pay levels and the need  \nto attract and engage our leaders. As         \ndiscussed in the CD&A, the long-term incentive\nprogram includes grants to NEOs and certain   \nother executives that include a risk-based    \nperformance metric. Payouts under these grants\ncould be forfeited if we do not meet the CET1 \nRatio described on page 51. We also have a    \nbroad-based clawback and incentive            \ncompensation adjustment policy as described   \nbeginning on page 64. We maintain an equity   \nprogram for approximately 145 senior leaders  \nbelow the executive levels that is designed to\nhelp ensure that their incentive compensation \nawards reflect risk-adjusted performance      \noutcomes that would pay out, if at all, over a\nthree-year period. These senior leaders       \nreceive a portion of their incentive          \ncompensation in an equity-based award that is \nsubject to the same risk-related performance  \nmetric that will be applied to the PSU and RSU\ngrants made to NEOs and certain other         \nexecutives. Additionally, the equity award    \nagreements for these senior leaders all       \ncontain an enterprise-wide risk-based review  \ntrigger, while the agreements for senior      \nleaders in business segments (as opposed to   \nthose in administrative or control functions) \ncontain an additional, business-specific risk-\nbased review trigger. If a risk-based review  \nis triggered, the applicable review committee \nwill determine whether a downward adjustment  \nis warranted, up to a complete cancellation of\nthe share units in that year\u2019s tranche. Risk  \nreview of compensation plans Our Chief Risk   \nOfficer reports at least quarterly to the     \nHuman Resources Committee to discuss risk     \nmanagement and review the connection between  \neffective risk management and incentive       \ncompensation. The Chief Risk Officer also     \npresents the Committee with a risk assessment \nfor each of our principal business units and a\ncollective assessment of staff functions,     \nincluding finance, human resources, legal,    \noperations and technology. In addition, we    \nmaintain at least one director who is a member\nof both the Human Resources and Risk          \nCommittees. At present, PNC\u2019s lead director,  \nwho is a member of the Risk Committee, also   \nserves on the Human Resources Committee. We   \nalso have systematically identified           \nindividuals who could potentially expose us to\nmaterial amounts of risk or financial loss. As\nwith our incentive compensation risk          \nassessment described below, we have           \nestablished a cross-functional team that      \ncontinues to identify and monitor these       \nindividuals. These individuals are subject to \na supplemental risk management review as part \nof the performance management process by the  \nChief Risk Officer and his designees; we take \nthis review into account when determining     \nincentive compensation awards for our most    \nsenior executives. We have developed a        \nstandardized governance framework for our     \nincentive compensation plans to help monitor  \nand validate that our plans balance risk and  \nreward, comply with applicable laws and       \nregulations, demonstrate fiscal responsibility\nand maintain an appropriate customer focus.   \nThis framework helps to ensure that we have   \nthe appropriate procedures, controls and      \nindependent challenges in place to do so. We  \ncontinue to assess and, where appropriate,    \nmodify our incentive compensation plans in    \naccordance with this framework to help ensure \nour plans appropriately reflect risk          \nconsiderations, including the management of   \nidentified issues, the duration of the risks  \nand alignment with our desired risk appetite. \nExamples of incentive plan modifications

This column    \n     includes the cost of financial           \n     consulting and tax preparation services  \n     for Mr.\u00a0Demchak, Mr.\u00a0Reilly, Mr.\u00a0        \n     Parsley, Ms.\u00a0Larrimer and Mr.\u00a0Jordan,    \n     reimbursement to Mr.\u00a0Demchak of $55,000  \n     in filing fees and related costs in      \n     connection with a filing required in     \n     compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino    \n     Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and  \n     the cost of personal use of corporate    \n     aircraft by Mr.\u00a0Demchak, Mr.\u00a0Lyons and   \n     Mr.\u00a0Jordan during 2022. The incremental  \n     cost of Mr.\u00a0Demchak\u2019s use of the         \n     aircraft in 2022 was $100,000. Mr.\u00a0      \n     Demchak used his time sharing agreement  \n     for flights in excess of this amount     \n     during 2022. The incremental cost to     \n  *  PNC of personal aircraft use is          \n     calculated by multiplying the total      \n     number of personal flight hours by the   \n     average direct variable operating costs  \n     (including costs related to fuel,        \n     maintenance expenses related to          \n     operation of the plane during the year,  \n     and landing and parking fees) per        \n     flight hour for the particular aircraft  \n     for the year, plus crew expenses         \n     attributable to the personal use. Since  \n     the aircraft are used primarily for      \n     business travel, we do not include in    \n     the calculation the fixed costs that do  \n     not change based on usage, such as crew  \n     salaries and other maintenance and       \n     inspection and capital improvement       \n     costs intended to cover a multiple-year  \n     period. The NEOs each have a corporate   \n     travel credit card not generally         \n     available to all employees, for which    \n     there is no incremental cost to PNC.     \n                                              \n                                              \n      We pay premiums for certain of the      \n      NEOs in connection with our Key         \n      Executive Equity Program, which is a    \n      split-dollar insurance arrangement. In  \n      addition, we pay long-term disability   \n      premiums on behalf of certain of our    \n      NEOs. New participants have not been    \n      permitted in either program since       \n      2007.

These premiums represent     \n      the full dollar amounts we paid for     \n      both the term and non-term portions of  \n      this plan. The amounts under this       \n      column also include the long-term       \n      disability premiums we paid on behalf   \n      of Mr.\u00a0Demchak ($4,876) and Mr.\u00a0Reilly  \n      ($4,195).

Cash   \nbalance pension plan.We maintain a pension    \nplan for most of our full-time employees. The \npension plan is a defined benefit cash balance\npension plan under the Employee Retirement    \nIncome Security Act of 1974, as amended       \n(\u201cERISA\u201d), and is intended to be qualified    \nunder Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue  \nCode. Each calendar quarter, eligible         \nparticipants receive \u201cearnings credits\u201d based \non a percentage of eligible compensation.     \nEarnings credit percentages for employees who \nwere plan participants on December 31, 2009   \nare based on a schedule using the             \nparticipant\u2019s age and years of credited       \nservice at that date and are frozen at that   \nlevel. Earnings credits for all employees who \nbecome participants on or after January 1,    \n2010 are a flat 3% of eligible compensation.  \nThe plan defines eligible \u201ccompensation\u201d as   \nregular earnings plus eligible variable       \ncompensation, such as paid annual incentives. \nEligible \u201ccompensation\u201d does not include      \ndeferrals under the terms of the non-         \nqualifieddeferred compensation and incentive  \nplan; these are instead taken into account    \nunder our excess pension plan described below.\nWe generally limit eligible variable          \ncompensation for a plan year to a total of    \n100% of the first $25,000 plus 50% of the next\n$225,000. For participants who had accrued    \nbenefits prior to 1999 under the pension plan \nformula then in effect, an initial cash       \nbalance \u201caccount\u201d was established based on the\npresent value of the accrued benefits at the  \ntime of the conversion to the current program.\nPlan participants generally receive quarterly \n\u201cinterest credits\u201d at a rate of one-fourthof  \nthe annual interest rate on 30-yearTreasury   \nsecurities. Employees who were already plan   \nparticipants as of December 31, 2009 receive a\nminimum interest credit. At the end of 2008,  \nthe cash balance pension plan previously      \nsponsored by National City Corporation was    \nmerged into this plan. Earnings and interest  \ncredits for National City participants are    \ngenerally as noted above. We contribute to the\nplan an actuarially determined amount         \nnecessary to fund the total benefits payable  \nto participants. Actuaries calculate total    \ncontributions instead of contributions for    \neach individual participant. Excess pension   \nplan.We maintain an ERISA excess pension plan,\nwhich is a supplemental non-qualifiedpension  \nplan. The excess benefits under this plan     \nequal the difference, if any, between a       \nparticipant\u2019s benefit under the qualified     \npension plan computed without regard to       \napplicable Internal Revenue Code limits and   \ntaking into account amounts deferred under the\nnon-qualifieddeferred compensation and        \nincentive plan, and the participant\u2019s actual  \nbenefit under the qualified pension plan.     \nSupplemental executive retirement plan.We     \nmaintain a supplemental executive retirement  \nplan for certain executive officers. As part  \nof its ongoing review of compensation         \npractices, the Human Resources Committee      \ndecided in 2007 to eliminate future plan      \nparticipation for new executive officers. This\nplan provides earnings credits based on a     \npercentage of annual incentives awarded under \neligible executive bonus plans in accordance  \nwith a schedule based on the participant\u2019s age\nand years of credited service. This plan also \nprovides quarterly interest credits that      \nmirror the interest credits under the         \nqualified pension plan. Executive officers who\nparticipated in the supplemental executive    \nretirement plan on December 31, 1998 and who  \nwere at least age 50 with five or more years  \nof credited service receive grandfathered     \nbenefits based on the pension formula in      \neffect prior to 1999. For executive officers  \nat or above a certain organizational level who\nparticipated on December 31, 1998 but who did \nnot meet the requirements for legacy benefits,\nwe doubled the earnings credit percentages in \norder to mitigate the effect of the transition\nto the cash balance pension formula.          \n                                              \n  78    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION TABLES                           \n                                              \n                   Numb\u2026       Pre\u2026           \n                      of       Val\u2026    Paym\u2026  \n                   Years         of    Duri\u2026  \n                   Cred\u2026       Acc\u2026    Last   \n          Plan     Serv\u2026       Ben\u2026    Fisc\u2026  \n  NEO     Name     (#)(\u2026       ($)\u2026    Year   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Wil\u2026    Qual\u2026                               \n  S.

Prior to establishing the DCIP \nin 2012, we offered a non-                    \nqualifiedsupplemental incentive savings plan  \n(\u201cSISP\u201d), which was a supplement to the ISP,  \nand a non-qualifieddeferred compensation plan \n(\u201cDCP\u201d), in each case for certain designated  \nemployees who exceeded applicable compensation\nthresholds. Incentive savings plan (ISP).The  \nISP is a defined contribution 401(k) plan that\nis intended to be qualified under Section     \n401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. During   \n2022, participants could elect to contribute  \nbetween 1% and 75% of eligible compensation to\nthe plan each year as pre-taxor Roth after-   \ntaxelective deferrals (or a combination of    \npre-taxand Roth after-taxelective deferrals), \nsubject to Internal Revenue Code limits.      \nParticipants who are age 50 or older may      \ncontribute additional pre-taxamounts called   \n\u201ccatch-upcontributions\u201d each year. For 2022,  \nwe made employer matching contributions on    \nbehalf of eligible participants equal to 100% \nof elective deferrals up to 4% of eligible    \ncompensation. Matching contributions were made\nin cash. Participants direct the investment of\ntheir accounts among the investment options   \noffered under the plan, and their account     \nbalances are adjusted for gains or losses     \nresulting from those investment directions.   \nDeferred compensation and incentive plan      \n(DCIP).We maintain a DCIP for designated      \nemployees who exceed a compensation threshold.\nParticipants can elect to defer up to 20% of  \nbase salary and/or up to 75% of eligible      \nshort-term incentive pay earned with respect  \nto a plan year. The DCIP\u2019s plan year is the   \ncalendar year. Participants can direct the    \ninvestment of their accounts among the        \nhypothetical investment alternatives made     \navailable under the plan, and their accounts  \nare adjusted for deemed investment gains or   \nlosses resulting from such investment         \ndirections. Supplemental incentive savings    \nplan (SISP) and deferred compensation plan    \n(DCP).Effective January 1, 2012, the SISP and \nDCP were frozen to new participants and to the\ndeferral of amounts earned on and after       \nJanuary 1, 2012. Distributions from these     \nplans are paid in cash in accordance with the \nparticipant\u2019s election. Participants with     \nexisting account balances can direct the      \ninvestment of their accounts among the        \nhypothetical investment alternatives made     \navailable under the plan, and their accounts  \nare adjusted for deemed investment gains or   \nlosses resulting from such investment         \ndirections. Investment options.ISP, DCIP, SISP\nand DCP participants have the investment      \noptions listed on page 82. The employee       \ndirects investment of contributions under each\nplan. Investment options include several      \ncollective funds and mutual funds (including  \nBlackRock mutual funds). ISP, SISP and DCP    \nparticipants may also hold investments in a   \nPNC common stock fund; however, we no longer  \npermit new funds to be contributed or         \ntransferred into the PNC common stock fund.   \nDCIP, SISP and DCP investments are invested on\na phantom basis and are considered \u201cdeemed\u201d   \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \n  80    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION TABLES                           \n                                              \n               Ex\u2026       Ag\u2026             Ag\u2026  \n               Co\u2026       Ea\u2026             Ba\u2026  \n               in         in              at  \n               La\u2026       La\u2026    A\u2026       La\u2026  \n        Na\u2026    FY         FY    W\u2026       FYE  \n        of     ($)       ($)    D\u2026       ($)  \n  N\u2026    Pl\u2026    (a)       (b)    (\u2026       (c)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  W\u2026    Su\u2026                                   \n  S.

termination of       \nemployment Our NEOs may receive various forms \nof compensation or benefits in connection with\na termination of employment. These benefits   \nresult from:                                  \n                                      \n  \u2022    change of control agreements,  \n                                      \n                                              \n  \u2022    the terms of our equity-based grants,  \n       and                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    other existing plans and arrangements  \n       in which our NEOs participate.         \n                                              \nWe do not have a separate severance plan or   \nprogram for the NEOs. The Human Resources     \nCommittee has discretion to provide severance \nbenefits subject to the parameters of our     \nBoard-approved policy, as described in the    \nCD&A on page 65. The benefits an executive may\nreceive will depend on whether PNC or the     \nexecutive terminated employment and, if PNC   \nterminated employment, whether the termination\nwas for cause, resulted from death or         \ndisability, or followed a change in control,  \nand whether the executive is retirement-      \neligible. If a retirement-eligible employee   \nresigns or is terminated without cause, we    \nconsider it a retirement. For these purposes, \na \u201cretirement-eligible\u201d employee is someone   \nwho is at least 55 years old and has at least \nfive years of service with PNC. As of December\n31, 2022, five of our six NEOs are retirement-\neligible. Change of control agreements As of  \nDecember 31, 2022, we have entered into       \nseparate change of control agreements with    \neach of our NEOs and similar agreements with a\nlimited group of other senior officers. These \nagreements have been a valuable component of  \nour executive compensation program for several\nyears. We believe these arrangements mitigate \nconcerns arising from a change of control, and\nhelp to ensure the continued dedicated service\nof our key employees. Cash payments           \ncontemplated by these agreements require a    \n\u201cdouble trigger\u201d \u2014 that is, the occurrence of \nboth a change of control and a qualifying     \ntermination of employment. A qualifying       \ntermination would occur if the executive      \nresigned for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or the surviving   \ncompany terminated the executive other than   \nfor \u201cCause,\u201d \u201cDisability\u201d or death (each as   \ndefined in the change of control agreement).  \nThe treatment of equity awards upon a change  \nof control is addressed in the equity award   \nagreements themselves, as described below,    \nrather than the change of control agreements. \nThe change of control agreements provide for  \ncash payments to our NEOs calculated based on \nvarious compensation components, including    \nannual base salary and an annual incentive    \naward (bonus). For purposes of the change of  \ncontrol agreements, annual base salary is     \nequal to 12 times the highest monthly base    \nsalary rate payable to the executive in the   \n12-monthperiod preceding the month of the     \nchange of control. The cash payment related to\nbase salary is equal to two times the annual  \nbase salary, and the cash payment related to  \nbonus is equal to two times the applicable    \nbonus percentage multiplied by annual base    \nsalary. The agreements also provide for       \ncontinued benefits under (or compute cash     \npayments by reference to) certain of our      \nretirement and health and welfare benefit     \nplans. None of our change of control          \nagreements contain any excise tax \u201cgross-     \nup\u201dprovisions. Our current change of control  \nagreements provide that in the event the      \nbenefits payable to an executive trigger      \nexcise taxes under Section 4999 of the        \nInternal Revenue Code, the executive will be  \nentitled to a reduction in benefits so that no\nexcise tax is imposed if such a reduction     \nwould result in a greater net (after-         \ntax)benefit to the executive than payment of  \nthe full amount of his or her benefits. We    \nhave a Board-approved policy that requires    \nshareholder approval of certain future        \nseverance arrangements if the arrangement     \nprovides for additional severance benefits in \nan amount exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the \nexecutive\u2019s annual base salary and target     \nbonus. The change of control agreements       \nprohibit the executives from employing or     \nsoliciting any of our officers during the one-\nyearperiod following termination, and from    \nusing or disclosing any of our confidential   \nbusiness or technical information or trade    \nsecrets. While the benefits to be received    \nunder a change of control agreement may be    \nsignificant to an individual, they first      \nrequire the occurrence of a significant       \ntransaction. As a result, the benefits are    \nhighly speculative and are contingent on a    \nvariety of facts and circumstances. In        \nrecognition of this, the Human Resources      \nCommittee of the Board does not consider the  \namount of potential change in control payments\nwhen it makes annual compensation decisions   \nfor our NEOs. Change in control protections,  \nalthough meaningful, also become relatively   \nless significant to PNC as we increase in     \nsize.                                         \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             83  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF          \nEMPLOYMENT Equity-based grants If an NEO      \nresigns or the NEO\u2019s employment is terminated \nwith or without cause, any unvested equity-   \nbased compensation is generally forfeited     \n(other than the PRSUs granted pursuant to the \nLeadership Continuity Awards, as described in \nmore detail below). However, if an NEO retires\n(i.e., a retirement-eligible NEO resigns or is\nterminated without cause), equity-based       \ncompensation is not forfeited and continues in\neffect until its originally scheduled payment \ndate (other than the Leadership Continuity    \nAwards, as described in more detail below).   \nEquity-based compensation is also not         \nforfeited under certain circumstances         \nfollowing a change in control. Grants to our  \nexecutive officers contain a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d \nfeature, meaning such grants require the      \noccurrence of both a change in control and a  \nqualifying termination (which includes a      \ntermination without cause or a resignation for\ngood reason) in order to vest prior to the    \noriginal vesting date in connection with a    \nchange in control. A change in control of PNC,\nretirement of an NEO or termination of an     \nNEO\u2019s employment by PNC by reason of          \ndisability or without cause has the following \nimpact on unvested equity-based compensation: \nRESTRICTED SHARE UNITS                        \n                                              \n  Change                                      \n  in

In  \naddition, the award is subject to grantee\u2019s   \nagreement not to solicit certain customers or \nemployees of PNC during employment and the    \none-yearperiod following termination of       \nemployment, to at all times maintain the      \nconfidentiality of business and technical     \ninformation, and to disclose and assign       \ncertain inventions. Awards are generally      \nsubject to PNC\u2019s clawback, adjustment, or     \nsimilar policies and to any clawback or       \nrecoupment that may be required by applicable \nlaw or regulations. Existing plans and        \narrangements As of December 31, 2022, our NEOs\ncould participate in our qualified cash       \nbalance pension plan, ERISA excess pension    \nplan, ISP and DCIP. In addition, Mr. Demchak, \nMr. Reilly, Mr. Parsley and Ms. Larrimer      \nparticipate in our SISP, and Mr. Demchak and  \nMr. Reilly participate in our DCP (although   \nthey may no longer make contributions to these\nplans). The NEOs earn these benefits for      \nservices provided to us while employed, and   \nmany of these plans are also available on a   \nbroader basis to other employees. For the most\npart, an NEO\u2019s entitlement to these benefits  \ndoes not depend on how employment is          \nterminated. Mr. Demchak and Mr. Reilly also   \nparticipate in our supplemental executive     \nretirement plan, a company-paid executive     \nlong-term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) program, and the \nKey Executive Equity Program (\u201cKEEP\u201d), a      \nsplit-dollar life insurance program.          \nParticipants in the executive LTD program are \ngenerally eligible for additional LTD benefits\nof $10,000 per month until they are no longer \ndisabled or have reached age 65. KEEP provides\nbenefits in the event of a participating      \nexecutive\u2019s death while actively employed     \n(equal to 1.5 times then-current annual base  \nsalary) or following an eligible retirement   \n(retirement after reaching age 55 and five    \nyears of service with PNC, generally equal to \nannual base salary prior to retirement).      \nFollowing a change in control, the life       \ninsurance policy would transfer to the        \nparticipating executive. The supplemental     \nexecutive retirement plan, executive LTD      \nprogram and KEEP were frozen to new           \nparticipants as of December 31, 2007. Certain \nNEOs are also eligible to receive two years of\ncompany-paid financial planning and tax       \npreparation services upon retirement.         \nEstimated benefits upon termination The       \nfollowing table shows the estimated           \nincremental benefits payable to our NEOs as of\nDecember 31, 2022 as a result of termination  \nof employment in a variety of situations.     \nThese estimated amounts have been calculated  \nas if employment was terminated on December   \n31, 2022. For change in control benefits, we  \nassumed a change in control of PNC and a      \ntermination of employment by the surviving    \ncompany without cause (or a resignation of the\nofficer for good reason) on that date. To the \nextent relevant, the amounts assume a PNC     \nstock price of $157.94, the closing price of  \nour common stock on December 30, 2022 (the    \nlast trading day of the year). If we          \ncalculated these amounts using a different    \nprice, the amounts could be significantly     \ndifferent. The benefits below do not include  \nthe balances under our qualified cash balance \npension plan, ERISA excess pension plan,      \nsupplemental executive retirement plan, SISP, \nISP, DCIP or DCP unless the NEO receives an   \nenhanced benefit under the termination        \nscenario. In addition, stock options are not  \nincluded as there were no stock options       \noutstanding for the NEOs as of December 31,   \n2022.                                         \n

In our view, Adjusted ROE    \nrepresents the most important financial       \nperformance measure (not otherwise required to\nbe disclosed in the table) used to link       \ncompensation actually paid (\u201cCAP\u201d) to our NEOs\nfor the 2022 fiscal year to company           \nperformance. We chose Adjusted ROE as our CSM \nfor evaluating pay versus performance because \nit is a key metric in our PSU awards under our\nlong-term incentive program.

Furthermore, since our PEO  \nreceived a larger proportion of his total     \nannual compensation in the form of long-term  \nequity-based incentive awards in 2020 than the\nNon-PEO NEOs, the impact of the increase in   \nstock price in 2021 on our PEO\u2019s CAP is more  \nsignificant than the impact on the average    \nNon-PEO NEO CAP for that year.

In connection with this \nresponsibility, the Committee evaluates,      \nmonitors and reports to the Board regarding   \nthe independence, qualifications and          \nperformance of the independent auditors,      \nincluding an evaluation of the lead audit     \npartner. The Committee approves all audit     \nengagement fees and terms associated with the \nretention of the independent auditors. The    \nAudit Committee charter requires the Committee\nto consider, not less frequently than when the\nlead audit partner is rotated, whether PNC    \nshould adopt a policy of regular rotation of  \nthe independent audit firm. In addition to    \nassuring the required rotation of the lead    \naudit partner, the Committee oversees the     \nselection of the new lead audit partner and   \nthe chair of the Committee participates       \ndirectly in the selection of the new lead     \naudit partner. The Audit Committee has        \nselected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\u201cPwC\u201d) as\nour independent auditors for 2023. PwC has    \nbeen our independent auditors since 2007. In  \nmaking this selection, the Committee          \nconsidered whether there should be a rotation \nof the independent audit firm. It also        \ncarefully considered, among other things,     \nPwC\u2019s qualifications and performance, the     \nquality and candor of its communications with \nthe Committee and PNC, and its independence,  \nobjectivity and professional skepticism. On   \nFebruary 16, 2023, the Committee presented its\nconclusions regarding the selection and       \nappointment of PwC as our independent auditors\nto the Board, including a determination that  \nthe selection of PwC as our independent       \nauditors is in the best interest of PNC.      \nFollowing this presentation, the Board voted  \nunanimously to recommend that shareholders    \nvote to ratify the Committee\u2019s selection of   \nPwC as our independent registered public      \naccounting firm for 2023. The Committee and   \nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof PwC as our independent auditors is in the  \nbest interest of PNC. The Audit Committee and \nthe Board have adopted a policy that if the   \nratification of the independent auditors does \nnot receive a majority of the votes cast at   \nthe annual meeting, the Committee will        \nreconsider its selection of independent       \nauditors. However, the Committee will be under\nno obligation to select new independent       \nauditors. If the Committee does select new    \nindependent auditors for 2023, we will not    \nseek shareholder ratification of the new      \nselection. We expect representatives of PwC to\nbe available during the annual meeting. They  \nwill have an opportunity to make a statement  \nand respond to appropriate questions. You can \nlearn more about the Audit Committee\u2019s        \nresponsibilities with respect to the          \nindependent auditors in the Committee\u2019s       \ncharter, which is posted in the corporate     \ngovernance section of our website at          \nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. Audit, audit-\nrelated and permitted non-auditfees In        \nconsidering the nature of the services        \nprovided by our independent auditors, the     \nAudit Committee determined that the services  \nare compatible with the provision of          \nindependent audit services. The Committee     \ndiscussed these services with the independent \nauditors and our management to determine that \nthey are permitted under SEC rules and        \nregulations concerning auditor independence.  \nThe following table summarizes the total fees \nfor professional services rendered by PwC to  \nPNC for 2022 and 2021:                        \n                                              \n  Category           2022\u00a0(in       2021\u00a0(in  \n                    millions)      millions)  \n  Audit fees            $21.4          $22.6  \n  Audit-rela\u2026            $2.8           $2.9  \n  fees*                                       \n  Tax fees               $0.1           $0.4  \n  TOTAL FEES            $24.3          $25.9  \n  BILLED                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Excludes fees of $2.0\u00a0million in 2022    \n     and $1.6\u00a0million in 2021 for financial   \n  *  due diligence services related to        \n     potential private equity investments.    \n     In those instances, the fees were paid   \n     by the company issuing the equity.       \n                                              \nAudit fees.These fees consisted primarily of  \nthe audit of our annual consolidated financial\nstatements, reviews of our quarterly          \nconsolidated financial statements included in \nForm 10-Qfilings, comfort letter procedures,  \nother services related to SEC matters and     \nrequired attestation services.

The Committee is given  \nthis responsibility to confirm that providing \nservices will not impair our auditors\u2019        \nindependence. The Committee performs this     \nfunction for us and our subsidiaries. The     \nAudit Committee\u2019s responsibility also includes\npre-approvalof the fees for such services     \n(although SEC regulations do not require the  \npre-approvalof fees) and the other terms of   \nthe engagement. The Committee may either pre- \napprovespecific fees or a methodology for     \ndetermining fees. Any proposed increase in    \nfees that exceeds the pre-approvedamounts     \nrequires the Committee\u2019s approval. Pre-       \napprovalmay be general (categories of         \nservices) or specific (individual services).  \nIf the Audit Committee pre-approvesa general  \ncategory of services, it will review the scope\nof services related to such general pre-      \napprovalat least annually. The Committee is   \nresponsible for approving any fee or other    \ncompensation arrangements for services covered\nby a pre-approvalof a general category of     \nservices. The full Audit Committee may        \nexercise pre-approvalauthority, or the chair  \nof the Committee may exercise the authority as\nrequired between meetings. The Committee may  \nalso delegate this authority, in whole or in  \npart, to one or more Committee members. Any   \nperson exercising delegated authority reports \non the pre-approvalsat the next scheduled     \nmeeting of the Committee, which will be       \nreflected in the meeting minutes. The         \nCommittee may not delegate its pre-           \napprovalauthority to any other person,        \nincluding any member of management or other   \nPNC employee or agent. The written request for\npre-approvalincludes, at a minimum, a         \ndescription of the nature of the engagement,  \nthe proposed fee for the services and a       \nstatement that the services to be performed by\nthe independent auditor are consistent with   \nSEC and other applicable rules on auditor     \nindependence. In addition, each pre-          \napprovalrequest is reviewed by the independent\nauditor to confirm the provision of services  \nis consistent with SEC and other applicable   \nauditor independence rules. All requests for  \npre-approvalof services are reviewed by       \nmanagement to ensure the services are         \npermitted under SEC regulations and the Audit \nCommittee charter and include a recommendation\nof the proposal by the Chief Financial Officer\nor the Controller and the General Auditor. In \nreviewing a pre-approvalrequest, the Committee\nor the chair of the Committee may request that\nmembers of management provide their views on  \nauditor independence questions. The Controller\nor a designee of the Controller reports to the\nAudit Committee at least quarterly as to the  \nstatus of services that have been pre-        \napprovedand the related fees. The Committee   \nmay amend these procedures from time to time. \nAll audit services, audit-related services and\npermitted non-auditservices and related fees  \ndisclosed above were pre-approvedby the Audit \nCommittee.                                    \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             97  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE The Audit       \nCommittee\u2019s job is one of oversight, as set   \nforth in its charter. It is not the duty of   \nthe Audit Committee to prepare PNC\u2019s          \nconsolidated financial statements, to plan or \nconduct audits, or to determine that PNC\u2019s    \nconsolidated financial statements are complete\nand accurate and are in accordance with       \ngenerally accepted accounting principles.     \nPNC\u2019s management is responsible for preparing \nPNC\u2019s consolidated financial statements and   \nfor establishing and maintaining effective    \ninternal control over financial reporting.    \nPNC\u2019s management is also responsible for its  \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal   \ncontrol over financial reporting. The         \nindependent auditors are responsible for the  \naudit of PNC\u2019s consolidated financial         \nstatements and the audit of the effectiveness \nof PNC\u2019s internal control over financial      \nreporting.

The Audit Committee has selected PwC\nas PNC\u2019s independent auditors for 2023,       \nsubject to shareholder ratification. A portion\nof the Audit Committee\u2019s review and discussion\nof PNC\u2019s audited consolidated financial       \nstatements with PwC occurred in private       \nsessions, without PNC management present. The \nAudit Committee has discussed with PwC the    \nmatters required to be discussed by the       \napplicable requirements of the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and  \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the   \n\u201cSEC\u201d).

Based on the review and discussions      \nreferred to above, the Audit Committee has    \nrecommended to the Board of Directors that the\naudited consolidated financial statements be  \nincluded in PNC\u2019s Annual Report on Form       \n10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2022, for \nfiling with the SEC.

As described in the next     \nitem, we are conducting an advisory           \nshareholder vote on the frequency of future   \nsay-on-payvotes at this year\u2019s annual meeting \nof shareholders. With this item, shareholders \nmay submit an advisory vote on the            \ncompensation of our CEO and the other five    \nexecutive officers named in the Summary       \ncompensation tableon page 71. The Summary     \ncompensation tableprovides an annual snapshot \nof the compensation paid or granted to our    \nNEOs. What does it mean to have a \u201csay-on-    \npay\u201dadvisory vote? As an advisory vote, the   \noutcome of the say-on-payvote will not bind   \nPNC or the Board. We will disclose how many   \nshareholders voted \u201cFor\u201d and \u201cAgainst\u201d the    \nresolution and how many shareholders abstained\nfrom voting. We believe in soliciting input   \nfrom our shareholders throughout the year on a\nvariety of issues, and this advisory vote fits\nwithin our broader shareholder engagement     \nefforts. Last year, approximately 96% of the  \nvotes cast by our shareholders approved the   \ncompensation of our named executive officers, \nand we have averaged approximately 96% support\nin say-on-payvotes over the past five years.  \nWhile this vote is non-binding,the Board      \nvalues the opinions of shareholders and will  \ncarefully consider the results when making    \nfuture compensation decisions. In considering \nan overall executive compensation program,    \nsay-on-paycannot convey a shareholder\u2019s view  \non a discrete element of our compensation     \nprogram or a specific decision made by the    \nHuman Resources Committee. Each year, the     \nCommittee receives reports on the outcome of  \nthe say-on-payvote, how our say-on-payvote    \ncompared to our peers and other large public  \ncompanies, and whether any changes to the     \ncompensation program were being recommended   \nfor the Committee\u2019s consideration in light of \nthe results. The Committee expects to         \nundertake a similar evaluation this year.     \nWhere can I find more information on executive\ncompensation? We describe our executive       \ncompensation program and the compensation     \nawarded under that program in the CD&A, the   \ncompensation tables and the related disclosure\ncontained in this proxy statement. See pages  \n44 to 87 for additional information. What are \nsome of the performance and compensation      \nprogram highlights for 2022? Please review the\nCD&A, which begins on page 44, as well as the \naccompanying compensation tables and related  \ndisclosure beginning on page 71. Performance  \nand compensation program highlights for 2022, \nwhich are included in the CD&A, should be read\nin conjunction with the full CD&A, the        \ncompensation tables and the related disclosure\ncontained in this proxy statement. The Board  \nof Directors recommends a vote FOR the        \nfollowing advisory resolution: \u201cRESOLVED, that\nthe holders of the common stock and the voting\npreferred stock of The PNC Financial Services \nGroup, Inc. (PNC), voting together as a single\nclass, approve the compensation of PNC\u2019s named\nexecutive officers as described in the        \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis,         \ncompensation tables and related disclosure    \ncontained in PNC\u2019s proxy statement for the    \n2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\u201d         \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                             99  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nFREQUENCY OF \u201cSAY-ON-PAY\u201dVOTE (ITEM 4) As     \ndescribed in Item 3, we are asking our        \nshareholders to approve an advisory vote on   \nthe compensation of our named executive       \nofficers, otherwise known as \u201csay-on-pay.\u201dThis\nItem 4 solicits input from our shareholders on\nhow frequently we should hold such an advisory\nvote in the future. You may vote for a say-on-\npayvote to be held every one, two or three    \nyears, or you may abstain from voting. As with\nsay-on-pay,we provide this vote pursuant to   \nSection 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 and this item is also an advisory vote,  \nwhich means that the outcome of the vote will \nnot bind PNC or the Board. We will disclose   \nhow many votes were received for each of the  \nthree frequency options (every one, two or    \nthree years), as well as the number of        \nabstentions from voting. We last held a vote  \nregarding the frequency of future say-on-     \npayvotes in 2017. Since then, consistent with \nthe recommendation of our shareholders        \nreflected by that vote, we have held say-on-  \npayvotes on an annual basis. After careful    \nconsideration, the Board recommends that we   \nshould continue to seek shareholder feedback  \nregarding the compensation of our NEOs through\nan annual say-on-payvote. The Board considers \nregular input on executive compensation from  \nour shareholders an important part of a       \ncomprehensive corporate governance program. As\ndiscussed in the CD&A, our executive          \ncompensation program consists of a variety of \nobjectives that include linking compensation  \nto performance over time and aligning the     \ninterests of our executive leadership and our \nlong-term shareholders. Despite the importance\nof performance over time periods beyond one   \nyear, the Human Resources Committee reviews   \nthe elements of our executive compensation    \nprogram periodically and adjusts executive    \ncompensation every year as appropriate.       \nTherefore, the Board believes that it may be  \nbeneficial to receive feedback from our       \nshareholders on an annual basis. While the    \nadvisory nature of this vote will not bind the\nBoard, it gives our shareholders an           \nopportunity to vote and inform us of their    \npreferred frequency for an advisory vote on   \nthe compensation of our NEOs. The Board will  \ncarefully consider the results of this        \nrecommendation in determining how frequently  \nto ask our shareholders to provide future     \nadvisory votes on the compensation of our     \nNEOs. We expect to conduct our next           \nshareholder vote on the frequency of future   \nsay-on-payvotes at our 2029 annual meeting of \nshareholders. The Board of Directors          \nrecommends a vote FOR a frequency of \u201cONE     \nYEAR\u201d for future advisory votes on the        \ncompensation of our named executive officers. \n                                              \n  100    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,    \n         INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement          \n                                              \nGENERAL INFORMATION We will hold our annual   \nmeeting of shareholders on Wednesday, April   \n26, 2023.

We refer to those who own \nPNC shares in their own name as \u201cregistered\u201d  \nholders or \u201cshareholders of record.\u201d We refer \nto those who own PNC shares through an account\nat an intermediary \u2014 such as a brokerage firm \nor bank \u2014 as holding shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d  \nor as \u201cbeneficial owners.\u201d For purposes of    \nreviewing the proxy materials and voting your \nshares, this distinction is important.        \nParticipating in the annual meeting The 2023  \nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders will be a      \nvirtual-only meeting held via webcast on      \nWednesday, April 26, 2023 at 11:00 a.m.       \nEastern Time.

This is referred to as a       \n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201dand it will not be counted as\na vote cast on the proposal.

We keep votes           \nconfidential and do not disclose them to our  \ndirectors, officers or employees, except:     \n                                              \n       As necessary to meet legal             \n  \u2022    requirements or to pursue or defend    \n       legal actions;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    To allow the Judge of Election to      \n       certify the voting results;            \n                                              \n                                              \n       When expressly requested by a          \n  \u2022    shareholder or benefit plan            \n       participant; or                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    If there is a contested proxy          \n       solicitation.                          \n                                              \nBroadridge Financial Services, Inc., our      \nindependent vote tabulator and Judge of       \nElection for the annual meeting, confirmed    \nthat its procedures will be consistent with   \nthis policy. How a proposal gets approved     \nQuorum .Under Pennsylvania law, we must have a\nquorum before we can consider proposals at an \nannual meeting. A \u201cquorum\u201d refers to the      \nminimum number of shares that must be present \nat the meeting. To have a quorum for the      \nannual meeting, we need the presence of PNC   \nshareholders or their proxies who are entitled\nto cast at least a majorityof the votes that  \nall shareholders are entitled to cast.        \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2023                            103  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nGENERAL INFORMATION In determining if a quorum\nexists, we count the number of shares         \nrepresented by shareholders who attend the    \nannual meeting and the number of shares       \nrepresented by proxies. If you return a proxy,\nwhether you vote for or against a proposal,   \nabstain from voting or only sign and date your\nproxy card, your shares will be counted as    \npresent for purposes of determining if a      \nquorum exists. Issued and outstanding shares  \n.On February 3, 2023, the record date for the \nannual meeting, we had approximately 400      \nmillion shares of common stock outstanding, as\nwell as additional shares of preferred stock. \nThe table below shows the number of issued and\noutstanding shares of our common and preferred\nstock entitled to vote on the record date. We \nhave additional issued and outstanding series \nof preferred stock that are not entitled to   \nvote at the meeting. The table also shows the \nnumber of votes for each share for the matters\nbrought before this meeting. The number of    \nvotes shown for each share of voting preferred\nstock equals the number of full shares of PNC \ncommon stock that can be acquired upon the    \nconversion of a share of preferred stock. At  \nthe meeting, holders of common and preferred  \nstock entitled to vote will vote together as a\nsingle class. There is no cumulative voting.  \n                                              \n               Issued                         \n                  and      Votes    Effecti\u2026  \n  Class      Outstan\u2026        Per      Voting  \n               Shares      Share       Power  \n             Entitled                         \n              to Vote                         \n  Common     399,753\u2026          1    399,753\u2026  \n  Prefer\u2026                                     \n  \u2014               503          8       4,024  \n  Series                                      \n  B                                           \n                                              \nVote required for approval .Different         \nproposals may have different voting           \nrequirements for approval. This section       \nprovides information regarding the vote       \nrequired for approval of each proposal        \npresented in the proxy statement and          \nadditional details regarding the mechanics of \nproposal approval. Under Pennsylvania law, if \nyou abstain from voting or fail to vote, your \nshares will not be counted as votes cast on   \nthe proposal. To abstain, you must check the  \n\u201cAbstain\u201d box on your proxy card, or select   \nthe appropriate option when voting by Internet\nor telephone. A broker non-voteis treated as a\nfailure to vote. Therefore, if you do not     \nprovide instructions to your broker or bank   \nregarding how to vote on a proposal that is a \nnon-routineitem, your shares will not be      \ncounted as votes cast on that proposal. If you\nare a shareholder of record and you sign, date\nand return your proxy card but do not provide \nvoting instructions, or you submit your proxy \nby Internet or telephone and do not provide   \nvoting instructions, we will vote your shares \nrepresented by that proxy as recommended by   \nthe Board and those shares will be counted as \nvotes cast. Election of directors (Item       \n1).Under Pennsylvania law, unless a company\u2019s \narticles of incorporation or bylaws provide   \notherwise, directors are elected by a         \nplurality of the votes cast. Our Bylaws       \ninclude an eligibility requirement for        \ndirector nominees in uncontested elections,   \nwhereby an incumbent director will offer to   \nresign from the Board if he or she does not   \nreceive a majority of the votes cast. To      \nreceive a majority of the votes cast, the     \nshares voted \u201cfor\u201d a director\u2019s election must \nexceed 50% of the total number of shares voted\nwith respect to that director\u2019s election. Our \nBylaws and corporate governance guidelines    \ndescribe this majority voting requirement and \nthe related procedure in the event that a     \ndirector must tender his or her resignation to\nthe Board. This is considered a non-          \nroutineitem, so there may be broker non-      \nvoteswith respect to this proposal. Broker    \nnon-votesand abstentions will not be included \nin the total votes cast and will not affect   \nthe results of the vote on this proposal.     \nRatification of independent registered public \naccounting firm (Item 2).A majority of the    \nvotes cast will be required to approve the    \nratification of the Audit Committee\u2019s         \nselection of PwC as our independent registered\npublic accounting firm for 2023. This is      \nconsidered a routine item, so brokers will    \nhave the discretion to vote uninstructed      \nshares on behalf of beneficial owners with    \nrespect to this proposal. Therefore, broker   \nnon-votesare not expected to exist for this   \nproposal, although a broker may otherwise fail\nto submit a vote. Failures by brokers to vote \nand abstentions will not be included in the   \ntotal votes cast and will not affect the      \nresults of the vote on this proposal. \u201cSay-on-\npay\u201d:Advisory vote on executive compensation  \n(Item 3).A majority of the votes cast will be \nrequired to approve this item, an advisory    \nvote on the compensation of our named         \nexecutive officers. Because your vote is      \nadvisory, it will not be binding on the Board \nor PNC. This is considered a non-routineitem, \nso there may be broker non-voteswith respect  \nto this proposal. Broker non-votesand         \nabstentions will not be included in the total \nvotes cast and will not affect the results of \nthe vote on this proposal. Frequency of \u201csay- \non-pay\u201dvote (Item 4). The frequency of future \nadvisory votes on the compensation of our     \nnamed executive officers\u2014every one year, every\ntwo years or every three years\u2014receiving the  \nhighest number of votes cast will be the      \nfrequency that shareholders approve on an     \nadvisory basis. Because it is an advisory     \nvote, it will not be binding on PNC or the    \nBoard. This is considered a non-routineitem,  \nso there may be broker non-voteswith respect  \nto this proposal. Broker non-votesand         \nabstentions will not be included in the total \nvotes cast and will not affect the results of \nthe vote on this proposal.                    \n                                              \n  104    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,    \n         INC.\u00a0-\u00a02023 Proxy Statement          \n                                              \nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2024 ANNUAL     \nMEETING SEC Rule 14a-8.If you are a           \nshareholder who would like us to include your \nproposal in the notice of our 2024 annual     \nmeeting of shareholders and related proxy     \nmaterials, you must comply with SEC Rule      \n14a-8,including with respect to submission of \nyour proposal by the applicable deadline.

If your      \nproposal is not received by the deadline or   \nyou do not otherwise comply with Rule 14a-8,we\nwill not consider your proposal for inclusion \nin next year\u2019s proxy materials. Advance notice\nprocedures.Under our Bylaws, shareholders may \nnominate an individual for election to the    \nBoard or propose other business to be brought \ndirectly at an annual meeting of shareholders \nby giving advance notice to PNC. To be        \neligible to do so, a shareholder must be a    \nshareholder of record as of the date the      \nnotice is delivered to PNC and at the time of \nthe annual meeting, must be entitled to vote  \nat the annual meeting and must comply with the\nnotice and other applicable procedures set    \nforth in our Bylaws.

Proxy access procedures.Our Bylaws permit \na shareholder, or a group of up to 20         \nshareholders, who has continuously for at     \nleast three years owned at least 3% of the    \noutstanding shares entitled to vote in the    \nelection of directors to nominate and include \nin our annual meeting proxy materials director\nnominees constituting up to the greater of two\ndirectors or 20% of the number of directors   \nserving on the Board on the last day on which \nnotice of a nomination may be delivered (known\ngenerally as \u201cproxy access\u201d). The proxy access\nnotice must be in writing and contain the     \ninformation specified in our Bylaws for a     \nproxy access nomination, and must be delivered\non a timely basis.
