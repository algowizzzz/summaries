(the \u201cCorporation\u201d) filed a\nStatement with Respect to Shares (the\n\u201cStatement\u201d) with the Secretary of State of\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania establishing\nthe rights, preferences, privileges,\nqualifications, restrictions and limitations\nof a new series of its preferred stock\ndesignated as the 6.200% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-\nCumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series\nV, $1.00 par value per share (the \u201cSeries V\nPreferred Stock\u201d). The Statement was filed in\nconnection with an Underwriting Agreement,\ndated as of August 16, 2022 (the \u201cUnderwriting\nAgreement\u201d), among the Corporation, BofA\nSecurities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets\nInc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and PNC\nCapital Markets LLC, pursuant to which the\nCorporation agreed to sell to the underwriters\n1,250,000 depositary shares (the \u201cDepositary\nShares\u201d) each representing a 1/100th ownership\ninterest in a share of the Series V Preferred\nStock. Each holder of a Depositary Share will\nbe entitled to the proportional rights of a\nshare of Series V Preferred Stock represented\nby the Depositary Share.\n\nThe Series V Preferred Stock ranks senior to\nthe Corporation\u2019s common stock, equally with\nthe Corporation\u2019s outstanding Series B, O, P,\nR, S, T and U Preferred Stock, and at least\nequally with each other series of preferred\nstock the Corporation may issue (except for\nany senior securities that may be issued with\nthe requisite consent of the holders of the\nSeries V Preferred Stock and all parity\nstock), with respect to payments of dividends\nand distributions of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up.\n\nUnder the terms of the Series V Preferred\nStock, the ability of the Corporation to pay\ndividends or distributions on, redeem,\npurchase or acquire, or make a liquidation\npayment with respect to its common stock or\nany preferred stock ranking on parity with or\njunior to the Series V Preferred Stock is\nsubject to restrictions in the event that the\nCorporation does not declare dividends on the\nSeries V Preferred Stock for the most recently\ncompleted dividend period, or, in the case of\na liquidation payment, does not pay to holders\nof the Series V Preferred Stock the\nliquidation value of $100,000 per share, plus\nany declared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n\nThe terms of the Series V Preferred Stock are\nmore fully described in the Statement, which\nis included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current\nReport on Form 8-K and is incorporated by\nreference herein.\n\nItem 5.03 Amendments to Articles of\nIncorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal\nYear.\n\nOn August 18, 2022, the Corporation filed the\nStatement with the Secretary of State of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, which became\neffective upon filing, amending its Amended\nand Restated Articles of Incorporation to\nestablish the newly authorized Series V\nPreferred Stock of the Corporation consisting\nof 12,500 authorized shares.\n\nHolders of Series V Preferred Stock will be\nentitled to receive, when, as and if declared\nby the Board of Directors of the Corporation\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) or a duly authorized committee\nof the Board, non-cumulative cash dividends\nbased on the liquidation preference (1) from\nthe original issue date of the Series V\nPreferred Stock to, but excluding, September\n15, 2027 (the \u201cfirst reset date\u201d), at a fixed\nrate per annum of 6.200%, and (2) from and\nincluding the first reset date, during each\nreset period (as defined below), at a rate per\nannum equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury\nrate (as defined in the Statement) as of the\nmost recent reset dividend determination date\n(as defined below) plus a spread of 3.238%. If\ndeclared by the Board or a duly authorized\ncommittee of the Board, dividends will be\npayable on the Series V Preferred Stock\nquarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15,\nSeptember 15 and December 15 of each year,\nbeginning on December 15, 2022. A \u201creset date\u201d\nmeans the first reset date and each date\nfalling on the fifth anniversary of the\npreceding reset date. Reset dates, including\nthe first reset date, will not be adjusted for\nbusiness days. A \u201creset period\u201d means the\nperiod from and including the first reset date\nto, but excluding, the next following reset\ndate and thereafter each successive period\nfrom, and including, each reset date to, but\nexcluding, the next following reset date. A\n\u201creset dividend determination date\u201d means, in\nrespect of any reset period, the day falling\nthree business days prior to the first day of\nsuch reset period.\n\nThe Series V Preferred Stock has a liquidation\npreference of $100,000 per share, plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends.\nLiquidating distributions will be made on the\nSeries V Preferred Stock only to the extent of\nthe Corporation\u2019s assets that are available\nafter satisfaction of all liabilities to\ndepositors and creditors and subject to the\nrights of holders of any security ranking\nsenior to the Series V Preferred Stock, and\npro rata as to the Series V Preferred Stock\nand any other shares of the Corporation\u2019s\nstock ranking equally as to such\ndistributions.\n\nThe Series V Preferred Stock does not have any\nmaturity date. Accordingly, the Series V\nPreferred Stock will remain outstanding\nindefinitely, unless and until the Corporation\ndecides to redeem it. The Series V Preferred\nStock is redeemable at the Corporation\u2019s\noption (1) in whole or in part, from time to\ntime, on any dividend payment date on or after\nthe first reset date, at a redemption price\nequal to $100,000 per share (equivalent to\n$1,000 per Depositary Share), plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends, or\n(2) in whole but not in part at any time\nwithin 90 days following a Regulatory Capital\nTreatment Event (as defined in the Statement),\nat a redemption price equal to $100,000 per\nshare (equivalent to $1,000 per Depositary\nShare), plus any declared and unpaid dividends\nand an amount equal to the partial dividend\nthat would have accrued from the prior\nscheduled dividend payment date to the\nredemption date. If the Corporation redeems\nthe Series V Preferred Stock, the depositary\nwill redeem a proportionate number of\nDepositary Shares. The Series V Preferred\nStock has no preemptive or conversion rights.\n\nThe Series V Preferred Stock has no voting\nrights except with respect to (1) authorizing,\nincreasing the authorized amount of or issuing\nsenior stock; (2) authorizing adverse changes\nin the terms of the Series V Preferred Stock;\n(3) certain merger events; (4) in the case of\ncertain non-payments of dividends only,\nelecting directors; and (5) as otherwise\nrequired under Pennsylvania law.\n\nThe terms of the Series V Preferred Stock are\nmore fully described in the Statement, which\nis included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current\nReport on Form 8-K and is incorporated by\nreference herein.\n                                              \n  Item 8.01 Other Events.                     \n                                              \nOn August 19, 2022, the Corporation closed the\npublic offering of 1,250,000 Depositary Shares\npursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
