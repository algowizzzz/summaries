See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income decreased $92 million, or\n3%, for the third quarter of 2023 compared to\nthe second quarter of 2023 as higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets were more than offset\nby increased funding costs. Net interest\nincome increased $1.2 billion, or 13%, for the\nfirst nine months of 2023 compared to the same\nperiod in 2022 as a result of higher interest-\nearning asset yields and balances, partially\noffset by higher funding costs. Net interest\nmargin decreased 8 basis points compared to\nthe second quarter of 2023 as higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets were more than offset\nby increased funding costs. Net interest\nmargin increased 24 basis points in the year-\nto-date comparison, reflecting the benefit of\nhigher yields on interest-earning assets.\n\nAverage investment securities for the third\nquarter of 2023 decreased $1.3 billion, or 1%,\ncompared to the second quarter of 2023 as\nlimited purchase activity during the quarter\nwas more than offset by portfolio paydowns and\nmaturities. Average investment securities\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nincreased $6.1 billion, or 5%, in the year-to-\ndate comparison, reflecting net securities\npurchases, primarily of agency residential\nmortgage-backed securities. Average investment\nsecurities represented 28% of average\ninterest-earning assets for both the third and\nsecond quarters of 2023, and 28% for the first\nnine months of 2023 compared to 27% for the\nfirst nine months of 2022.\n\nAverage loans for the third quarter of 2023\ndecreased $5.0 billion, or 2%, compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower\ncommercial loans, partially offset by an\nincrease in consumer loans. Average loans\nincreased $20.2 billion, or 7%, in the year-\nto-date comparison, reflecting growth in both\ncommercial and consumer loans. Average loans\nrepresented 63% of average interest-earning\nassets for the third quarter of 2023 compared\nto 64% for the second quarter of 2023, and 64%\nfor the first nine months of 2023 compared to\n62% for the first nine months of 2022.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the third quarter of 2023 increased $6.9\nbillion, or 22%, compared to the second\nquarter of 2023 primarily due to lower loan\nbalances. In the year-to-date comparison,\naverage interest-earning deposits with banks\ndecreased $10.0 billion, or 22%, primarily due\nto higher loan balances and lower deposits,\npartially offset by higher borrowed funds.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nthird quarter of 2023 increased $2.0 billion,\nor 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nfirst nine months of 2023 increased $15.8\nbillion, or 5%, compared to the same period in\n2022. The increase in both comparisons\nreflected a continued shift from noninterest-\nbearing to interest-bearing deposits as\ndeposit rates have risen. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits represented 82% of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities for the\nthird quarter of 2023 compared to 83% for the\nsecond quarter of 2023, and 83% for the first\nnine months of 2023 compared to 89% for the\nfirst nine months of 2022.\n\nAverage borrowed funds increased $1.8 billion,\nor 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2023\nprimarily due to parent company senior debt\nissuances near the end of the second quarter.\nAverage borrowed funds increased $28.6\nbillion, or 78%, in the year-to-date\ncomparison due to higher FHLB borrowings and\nparent company senior debt issuances.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 35% for the third quarter of 2023\ncompared to 34% for the second quarter of\n2023, and 35% for the first nine months of\n2023 compared to 39% for the same period in\n2022.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees were\nstable compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nThe decrease in the year-to-date comparison\nreflected lower client activity. PNC\u2019s\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nof $176 billion at September 30, 2023 were\nstable compared to June 30, 2023. PNC\u2019s\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased $10 billion from $166 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 driven by higher spot\nequity markets, partially offset by client\nactivity.\n\nCapital markets and advisory fees decreased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2023 driven\nby lower trading revenue. The decrease in the\nyear-to-date comparison was primarily due to\nlower merger and acquisition advisory fees and\ntrading revenue.\n\nCard and cash management revenue decreased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2023 as\nincreased treasury management product revenue\nwas more than offset by lower consumer\ntransaction volumes. The increase compared to\nthe first nine months of 2022 was primarily\ndue to higher treasury management product\nrevenue.\n\nLending and deposit services increased in both\nthe quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nreflecting increased customer activity. In\ncomparison to the first nine months of 2022,\nthe increase was also driven by growth in loan\ncommitment fees.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 7\nResidential and commercial mortgage increased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2023,\nprimarily due to a $97 million increase in\nmortgage servicing rights valuation, net of\neconomic hedge. The increase compared to the\nfirst nine months of 2022 was driven by higher\nresidential mortgage banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased both in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons. Both\ncomparisons included lower private equity\nrevenue and the impact of negative Visa Class\nB derivative fair value adjustments related to\nthe extension of anticipated litigation\nresolution timing. Negative Visa Class B fair\nvalue adjustments were $51 million for the\nthird quarter of 2023 compared to $83 million\nfor the second quarter of 2023.

Average loans for\nthis business increased driven by strong new\nproduction throughout 2022 and higher average\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased largely due to new\nproduction throughout 2022, partially offset\nby a lower average utilization of loan\ncommitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is mainly secured by\nbusiness assets. Average loans for this\nbusiness increased primarily driven by new\nproduction, partially offset by lower average\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by\nlower average utilization of loan commitments,\nPPP loan forgiveness and paydowns outpacing\nnew production.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits decreased compared\nto the nine months ended September 30, 2022,\nreflecting the impact of quantitative\ntightening by the Federal Reserve and included\na continued shift from noninterest-bearing to\ninterest-bearing deposits as deposit rates\nhave risen. We continue to actively monitor\nthe interest rate environment and make\nadjustments to our deposit strategy in\nresponse to evolving market conditions, bank\nfunding needs and client relationship\ndynamics.\n\nFollowing the BBVA acquisition in 2021 and our\nde novo expansion efforts, we are now a coast-\nto-coast franchise and have a presence in the\nlargest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical\nareas.

On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationships\nexist. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services. A discussion of the\nconsolidated revenue from these services\nfollows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nTreasury management revenue is reported in\nnoninterest income and net interest income.\nNoninterest income includes treasury\nmanagement product revenue less earnings\ncredits provided to customers on compensating\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\ndeposit balances used to pay for products and\nservices. Net interest income includes funding\ncredit from all treasury management customer\ndeposit balances. Compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2022, treasury management revenue\nincreased due to wider interest rate spreads\non the value of deposits and higher product\nrevenue.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower commercial mortgage\nservicing income driven by higher commercial\nMSRs amortization.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading. The decrease in\ncapital markets and advisory fees in the\ncomparison was mostly driven by lower merger\nand acquisition advisory fees and lower loan\nsyndication fees, partially offset by higher\ncustomer-related trading revenue for\nderivatives, foreign exchange and fixed\nincome.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 19\n

This business seeks to deliver high\nquality banking, trust and investment\nmanagement services to our emerging affluent,\nhigh net worth and ultra high net worth\nclients through a broad array of products and\nservices.\n\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nInstitutional Asset Management provides\noutsourced chief investment officer, custody,\ncash and fixed income client solutions, and\nretirement plan fiduciary investment services\nto institutional clients, including\ncorporations, healthcare systems, insurance\ncompanies, municipalities and non-profits.\n\nAsset Management Group earnings in the first\nnine months of 2023 decreased $90 million\ncompared to the same period in 2022, primarily\ndriven by lower net interest income, higher\nnoninterest expense and a decrease in\nnoninterest income.\n\nNet interest income decreased in the\ncomparison due to a decline in average\ndeposits as well as narrower interest rate\nspreads on the value of loans.\n\nNoninterest income decreased in the comparison\ndriven by lower asset management fees due to\nthe impact of client activity.\n\nNoninterest expense increased in the\ncomparison, reflecting continued investments\nto support business growth.\n\nAverage loans increased compared with the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, driven by\ngrowth in residential real estate lending,\npartially offset by a decrease in security\nbased lending lines of credit.\n\nAverage deposits decreased in the comparison\ndue to competitive pricing pressures as\nclients continue to seek higher yielding\nreturns, including deploying funds into\ndiscretionary client assets under management.\n\nDiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased in comparison to the prior year,\nprimarily due to higher equity markets as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ISK                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  M                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ANAGEMENT                                   \n                                              \nThe Risk Management section included in Item 7\nof our 2022 Form 10-K describes our enterprise\nrisk management framework, including risk\nculture, enterprise strategy, risk governance\nand oversight framework, risk identification,\nrisk assessments, risk controls and\nmonitoring, and risk aggregation and\nreporting.

The following provides\nadditional information about the significant\nloan classes that comprise our Commercial and\nConsumer portfolio segments.\n\nCommercial\n\nCommercial and Industrial\n\nCommercial and industrial loans comprised 55%\nand 56% of our total loan portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The majority of our commercial\nand industrial loans are secured by collateral\nthat provides a secondary source of repayment\nfor a loan should a borrower experience cash\ngeneration difficulties. Examples of this\ncollateral include short-term assets, such as\naccounts receivable, inventory and securities,\nand long-lived assets, such as equipment,\nowner-occupied real estate and other business\nassets.\n\nWe actively manage our commercial and\nindustrial loans to assess any changes (both\npositive and negative) in the level of credit\nrisk at both the borrower and portfolio level.\nTo evaluate the level of credit risk, we\nassign internal risk ratings reflecting our\nestimates of the borrower\u2019s PD and LGD for\neach related credit facility. This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geographies that may exist in our\nportfolio. Our commercial and industrial\nportfolio is well-diversified across\nindustries as shown in the following table\n(based on the North American Industry\nClassification System).\n\nTable 16: Commercial and Industrial Loans by\nIndustry\n                                              \n           Se\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           30,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  29\u2026     17  %    $  30\u2026     17  %  \n  R\u2026       28\u2026     16          29\u2026     16     \n  t\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026       22\u2026     13          21\u2026     12     \n  s\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       21\u2026     12          23\u2026     13     \n  p\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026       16\u2026      9          17\u2026     10     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       10\u2026      6          11\u2026      7     \n  &                                           \n  t\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       10\u2026      6          10\u2026      6     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       7,\u2026      5          7,\u2026      4     \n  w\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       27\u2026     16          29\u2026     15     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $  17\u2026    100  %    $  18\u2026    100  %  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real\nestate and construction industries.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate loans comprised $21.4\nbillion related to commercial mortgages on\nincome-producing properties, $6.3 billion of\nreal estate construction project loans and\n$8.1 billion of intermediate-term financing\nloans as of September 30, 2023.

The remaining 41% of the portfolio is\nprimarily comprised of single-tenant,\ngovernment tenant and medical office tenant\nproperties.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 23\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  19\u2026    42    %    $  1\u2026     41   %  \n  \u2026       4,\u2026     9            4\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       987     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    17            8\u2026     18      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  47\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  772                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              73    %              71   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at September 30, 2023.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us. We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $42.2 billion at September 30,\n2023, with 45% located in California.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were\n$40.6 billion and 44%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $20.4 billion of\nhome equity lines of credit and $5.8 billion\nof closed-end home equity installment loans at\nSeptember 30, 2023. Comparable amounts were\n$19.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of December\n31, 2022, respectively. Home equity lines of\ncredit are a variable interest rate product\nwith fixed rate conversion options available\nto certain borrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\ntrack borrower performance of this portfolio\non a monthly basis. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, legacy brokered home\nequity loans, home equity lines of credit or\nlegacy brokered home equity lines of credit)\nand track the historical performance of any\nrelated mortgage loans regardless of whether\nwe hold such liens. This information is used\nfor internal reporting and risk management. As\npart of our overall risk analysis and\nmonitoring, we also segment the portfolio\nbased upon loan delinquency, nonperforming\nstatus, modification and bankruptcy status,\nFICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 19: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4,\u2026    18    %    $  5\u2026     19   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    12            3\u2026     13      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     9            2\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     8            2\u2026      8      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     6            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6,\u2026    24            6\u2026     24      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  26\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              53    %              58   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              47                   42      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n  \u2026       30,                  3\u2026             \n  \u2026       20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  772                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              65    %              67   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at September 30, 2023.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $13.8 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.1 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of September 30,\n2023.

PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for each of PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the third quarter of 2023.\nFluctuations in our average LCR result from\nchanges to the components of the calculation,\nincluding high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon.

At September 30,\n2023, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or through issuing its\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n   Parent Company Liquidity                   \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAt September 30, 2023, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $17.4 billion.\nParent company liquidity is held in\nintercompany cash and investments. For\ninvestments with longer durations, the related\nmaturities are aligned with scheduled cash\nneeds, such as the maturity of parent company\ndebt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $6.1 billion at September 30,\n2023. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in our\n2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Under the parent company\u2019s\n2014 commercial paper program, the parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At September 30, 2023,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nThe following table details parent company\nnote issuances in the third quarter of 2023:\n                                              \n  Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued       \n                                              \n                                              \n  Issuance       Amount          Description  \n  Date                           of Issuance  \n                                 $750         \n                                 million of   \n                                 senior       \n                                 fixed-to-f\u2026  \n                                 notes with   \n                                 a maturity   \n                                 date of      \n                                 August 18,   \n                                 2034.        \n                                 Interest is  \n                                 payable      \n                                 semi-annua\u2026  \n                                 in arrears   \n                                 at a fixed   \n                                 rate of      \n                                 5.939% per   \n                                 annum, on    \n                                 February 18  \n                                 and August   \n                                 18 of each   \n                                 year,        \n                                 beginning    \n                                 on February  \n                                 18, 2024.    \n                                 Beginning    \n                                 on August    \n                                 18, 2033,    \n                                 interest is  \n                                 payable      \n                                 quarterly    \n  August 18,                     in arrears   \n  2023           $750 million    at a         \n                                 floating     \n                                 rate per     \n                                 annum equal  \n                                 to           \n                                 Compounded   \n                                 SOFR         \n                                 (determined  \n                                 with         \n                                 respect to   \n                                 each         \n                                 quarterly    \n                                 interest     \n                                 period       \n                                 using the    \n                                 SOFR Index   \n                                 as           \n                                 described    \n                                 in the       \n                                 Prospectus   \n                                 Supplement\u2026  \n                                 plus         \n                                 1.946%, on   \n                                 November     \n                                 18, 2033,    \n                                 February     \n                                 18, 2034,    \n                                 May 18,      \n                                 2034 and at  \n                                 the          \n                                 maturity     \n                                 date.        \n                                              \nParent company senior and subordinated debt\noutstanding totaled $19.6 billion and $13.1\nbillion at September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively.\n\nSee Note 17 Subsequent Events for details on\nthe parent company\u2019s issuances of $1.25\nbillion of its 6.615% senior fixed-to-floating\n\nrate notes that mature on October 27, 2023 and\n$2.25 billion of its 6.875% senior fixed-to-\nfloating rate notes that mature on October 20,\n2034.\n                                              \n  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     \n                                              \nWe have contractual obligations representing\nrequired future payments on borrowed funds,\ntime deposits, leases, pension and\npostretirement benefits and purchase\nobligations.

Consistent\nwith the SCB framework, which allows for\ncapital return in amounts in excess of the SCB\nminimum levels (the regulatory minimum (4.5%)\nplus our SCB), our Board of Directors has\nauthorized a repurchase framework under the\npreviously approved repurchase program of up\nto 100 million common shares, of which\napproximately 46% were still available for\nrepurchase at September 30, 2023. In light of\nthe Federal banking agencies proposed rules to\nadjust the Basel III capital framework, share\nrepurchase activity was paused in the third\nquarter of 2023 and is expected to remain\npaused during the fourth quarter of 2023. PNC\ncontinues to evaluate the potential impact of\nthe proposed rules and may resume share\nrepurchase activity depending on market and\neconomic conditions, as well as other factors.\nPNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter period\nbeginning October 1, 2023 is the regulatory\nminimum of 2.5%.\n\nOn October 2, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.55 per share.

Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, $1.7 billion was invested\ndirectly in a variety of companies and $0.2\nbillion was invested indirectly through\nvarious private equity funds.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the September 30, 2023\nper share closing price of $230.01 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.3 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K and\nNote 13 Legal Proceedings in this Report for\nadditional information regarding our Visa\nagreements, and Visa\u2019s proposed amendments to\nits Certificate of Incorporation to institute,\nif approved by stockholders, an exchange offer\nprogram that would release transfer\nrestrictions on portions of the Visa Class B\ncommon shares. The estimated value does not\nrepresent fair value of the Visa B common\nshares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $17 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and $26\nmillion for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional and an underlying as\nspecified in the contract. Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in our 2022 Form 10-K\nand in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12\nFinancial Derivatives in this Report.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n\n36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ECENT                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGULATORY                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVELOPMENTS                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                 \n                                              \nIn August 2023, the federal banking agencies\nproposed rules that would require Category II,\nIII, and IV bank holding companies under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Enhanced Prudential\nStandards to issue and maintain minimum\namounts of long-term debt that satisfies\ncertain requirements. Under the proposal,\ninsured depository institutions of such bank\nholding companies would also be required to\nissue and maintain long-term debt internally\nto a company that consolidates the insured\ndepository institution, which in turn would be\nrequired to purchase that long-term debt.\nAdditionally, Category II, III, and IV bank\nholding companies would be subject to \u201cclean\nholding company\u201d requirements, which would\nprohibit such companies from entering into\ncertain financial arrangements and cap\nliabilities that are not long-term debt and\nrank at either the same priority as or junior\nto eligible external long-term debt. PNC, as a\nCategory III holding company, and PNC Bank\nwould be subject to the rules and would have a\nthree-year phase-in period after any final\nrule to achieve compliance with the long-term\ndebt requirements. If the rules were finalized\nin their current form, we would expect to\nachieve compliance through normal course\nfunding.\n                                              \n  Resolution Plan Requirements                \n                                              \nIn August 2023, the FDIC proposed changes to\nits rule requiring certain insured depository\ninstitutions, including PNC Bank, to\nperiodically submit a resolution plan that, in\nthe event of a hypothetical failure, should\nenable the FDIC to resolve the bank under the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. Under the\nproposed rule, banks with $100 billion or more\nin assets, such as PNC Bank, would be required\nto submit full resolution plans on a two-year\ncycle with an interim informational supplement\nand FDIC supervisory activities and\ncapabilities testing between full submissions.\nThe proposed rule would significantly expand\nthe required content elements and add virtual\ndata room and valuation capabilities as\nsignificant components of the resolution\nplanning process. The proposal would divide\nbanks with $100 billion or more in assets into\ntwo future groups, with one group of banks\nrequired to submit their first full resolution\nplan under the new rule at least 270 days\nafter the effective date of the final rule,\nand the other submitting full plans the\nfollowing year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and FDIC also proposed new\nguidance for holding company resolution plans\nsubmitted by triennial full filers, such as\nPNC, under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank\nAct and the implementing regulations. The\nproposed guidance bifurcates each area of\nrequirements into separate sections for single\npoint of entry and multiple point of entry\nresolution strategies, generally applying\u2014to\nthe extent relevant to each resolution\nstrategy\u2014the expectations from the 2019\nresolution plan guidance applicable to U.S.\nGSIBs. Firms like PNC with a multiple point of\nentry resolution strategy would be required to\nincorporate more severe plan assumptions and\ninclude new required plan content, operational\ncapabilities, legal entity rationalization,\nand separability options, among other\nrequirements. PNC\u2019s next 165(d) resolution\nplan is due July 1, 2024, unless the Federal\nReserve and FDIC provide an extension.\n                                              \n  Other Regulatory Developments               \n                                              \nOn October 19, 2023, the CFPB proposed for\npublic comment a rule to implement Section\n1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires\ncertain entities, including PNC and PNC Bank,\nto, upon request, make available to a consumer\ninformation in the entity\u2019s control or\npossession concerning the consumer financial\nproduct or service that the consumer obtained\nfrom that entity. In general, the proposed\nrule would require data providers holding a\nconsumer account, such as PNC Bank, to\nestablish a developer interface satisfying\ncertain security and other standards, accept\nrequests for specific types of data covered by\nthe rule through the developer interface and,\nin response to such a request, make that data\navailable in electronic form to consumers and\nauthorized third parties, including data\naggregators. Data providers could not charge\nconsumers or third parties fees for processing\nthese requests. The proposed rule would also\nplace data security, authorization, and other\nobligations on third parties accessing covered\ndata from data providers, which could include\nPNC and PNC Bank when acting in certain\ncapacities. The rule would also require third\nparties to limit their collection, use, and\nretention of the data received to only that\nreasonably necessary to provide the consumer\u2019s\nrequested product or service. The rule would\nbe effective for PNC and PNC Bank six months\nafter publication of the final rule.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking\nagencies issued a final rule to amend the\nregulations implementing the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA), which requires the\nagencies to assess a bank\u2019s record of meeting\nthe credit needs of the communities in which\nthey do business, including low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods. The rule significantly\nexpands the number of areas in which a bank is\nevaluated, materially changes the tests used\nto evaluate the bank in those areas and\nexpands the data a bank must collect and\nreport. We expect the rule will increase PNC\nBank\u2019s obligations and compliance costs\nnecessary to achieve a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d rating under the CRA framework,\nwhich factors into the ability of banks to\nexpand and engage in new activities.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve\nproposed revisions to the three components of\nthe interchange fee cap for a debit card\ntransaction received by a debit card issuer\nthat does not qualify for a statutory\nexemption, such as PNC Bank. Under the\nproposed rule, the base component would\ndecrease from 21.0 to 14.4 cents, the ad\nvalorem component would decrease from 5.0\nbasis points to 4.0 basis points (multiplied\nby the value of the transaction) and for a\ndebit card issuer that meets certain fraud-\nprevention standards, the fraud-prevention\nadjustment component would increase from 1.0\ncents to 1.3 cents. The proposed rule would\nalso codify an approach to update the three\ncomponents every other year. The final rule\nwould take effect on the first day of the next\ncalendar quarter that begins at least 60 days\nafter the rule is published.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 37\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nOur consolidated financial statements are\nprepared by applying certain accounting\npolicies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2022 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2022\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected prepayments\nand estimated recoveries. Our determination of\nthe ACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We\nincorporate qualitative factors in the ACL\nthat reflect our best estimate of expected\nlosses that may not be adequately represented\nin our quantitative methods or economic\nassumptions. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio\nvolume and mix could materially affect our\nestimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework that includes a three-year\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios with associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes. Credit losses\nestimated in our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of the scenarios used and weights\nassigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios, we use a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment to forecast the\ndistribution of economic outcomes over the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nEach scenario is then given an associated\nprobability (weight) to represent our current\nexpectation within that distribution over the\nforecast period. This process is informed by\ncurrent economic conditions, expected business\ncycle evolution and the expert judgment of\nPNC\u2019s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans, securities and other\nfinancial assets. Each quarter, the scenarios\nare presented to RAC for approval, and the\ncommittee also approves CECL scenario weights\nfor use during the current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 consider, among other\nfactors, the ongoing inflationary pressures\nand the corresponding tightening of monetary\npolicy and credit availability. Our most-\nlikely expectation at September 30, 2023 is\nthat the U.S. economy will be impacted by a\nmild recession starting in the first half of\n2024.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nTable 35: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                Assumptio\u2026                    \n                     as of                    \n                 September                    \n                  30, 2023                    \n                      2023      2024    2025  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. real           2.1%    (0.1)%    1.9%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026          3.8%      4.6%    4.6%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                Assumptio\u2026                    \n                     as of                    \n                  December                    \n                  31, 2022                    \n                      2023      2024    2025  \n  U.S. real         (0.4)%      1.4%    1.9%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026          4.9%      4.9%    4.4%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss)\nrates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2023 at\n2.1% on a weighted average basis, up from the\n(0.4%) assumed at December 31, 2022, primarily\ndue to stronger-than-anticipated growth in the\nfirst half of 2023. Growth then drops to\n(0.1)% in 2024, before jumping to 1.9% in\n2025. In line with stronger-than-anticipated\njob growth in 2023, the weighted-average\nprojection of the unemployment rate is\nexpected to end 2023 at 3.8%, down from the\n4.9% assumed at December 31,2022. The\nweighted-average unemployment rate is then\nexpected to increase through 2024, reaching\n4.6% by year-end 2024, and remain flat at 4.6%\nthrough the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe current state of the economy reflects an\nenvironment with receding pandemic-related\nrisks and labor-related supply chain\npressures. However, heightened uncertainty\nremains due to structural and secular changes\nfostered by the pandemic for certain sectors\nof the economy combined with inflation, rising\ninterest rates and declining consumer savings\nand deposit balances. As such, for both our\ncommercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC\nidentified and performed significant analysis\naround segments impacted by such uncertainties\nto ensure our reserves are adequate, given our\ncurrent macroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analyses, we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nappropriately reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nSee the following for additional details on\nthe components of our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Financial\nReview,\n\n\u2022 Note 2 Investment Securities, and\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses.\n                                              \n  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  \n                                              \nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies regarding the\nimpact of new accounting pronouncements that\nwe have adopted.\n\nI NTERNAL C ONTROLS A ND D ISCLOSURE C ONTROLS\nA ND P ROCEDURES\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we performed an\nevaluation under the supervision of and with\nthe participation of our management, including\nthe Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and the Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and of changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nBased on that evaluation, our Chairman,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and our\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)\nwere effective as of September 30, 2023, and\nthat there has been no change in PNC\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting that\noccurred during the third quarter of 2023 that\nhas materially affected, or is reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 39\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time.

We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 Economic growth accelerated in the first\nhalf of 2023, but ongoing Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy tightening to slow inflation\nis weighing on interest-rate sensitive\nindustries. Sectors where interest rates play\nan outsized role, such as business investment\nand consumer spending on durable goods, will\ncontract in 2024.\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline outlook is for a mild\nrecession starting in mid-2024, with a small\ncontraction in real GDP of less than 1%,\nlasting into late 2024. The unemployment rate\nwill increase through the rest of 2023 and\nthroughout 2024, peaking at close to 5% in\nearly 2025. Inflation will slow with weaker\ndemand, moving back to the Federal Reserve\u2019s\n2% objective by the second half of 2024.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain\nunchanged in the near term, between 5.25% and\n5.50% through mid-2024, with federal funds\nrate cuts starting in the third quarter of\n2024 in response to the recession.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities.

We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2022 Form 10-K. These interim consolidated\nfinancial statements serve to update our 2022\nForm 10-K and may not include all information\nand Notes necessary to constitute a complete\nset of financial statements. There have been\nchanges to certain of our accounting policies\nas disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K due to the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASU\n2022-02) in the first quarter of 2023 and the\nadoption of ASU 2023-02 Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures Using the\nProportional Amortization Method (ASU 2023-02)\nin the third quarter of 2023. The updated\npolicies impacted by this adoption are\nincluded in this Note 1. Reference is made to\nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form\n10-K for a detailed description of all other\nsignificant accounting policies.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. The CARES\nAct credit reporting rules, which required\nexceptions to this policy, expired in the\nthird quarter of 2023. As such, delinquency\nstatus at September 30, 2023 is being reported\nfor all loans based on the contractual terms\nof each loan. Prior period amounts continue to\nbe presented in accordance with the credit\nreporting rules under the CARES Act, which\nrequired certain loans modified due to\npandemic-related hardships to not be reported\nas past due based on the contractual terms of\nthe loan, even when borrowers may not have\nmade payments on their loans during the\nmodification period.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 47\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method over the\ncontractual life. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method,\nover the contractual life of the loan. The\nprocessing fee received for loans originated\nthrough PPP lending under the CARES Act is\ndeferred and accreted into Net interest income\nusing the effective yield method, over the\ncontractual life of the loan. Loans under the\nfair value option are reported at their fair\nvalue, with any changes to fair value reported\nas Noninterest income on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement, and are excluded from the\nmeasurement of ALLL.\n\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination ( i.e. , PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe acquisition date. PNC considers a variety\nof factors in connection with the\nidentification of more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality, including but\nnot limited to nonperforming status,\ndelinquency, risk ratings and other\nqualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that are attributable, at least in\npart, to credit quality are recognized through\na charge to the provision for credit losses\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nare recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL .\n\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\n\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, or when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to measure the loan at the estimated\nfair value of collateral (less costs to sell\nif sale or foreclosure of the property is\nexpected).\n\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable. Collateral dependent designation is\nremoved when a loan no longer meets these\nconditions.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02,\nwhich eliminates the accounting guidance for\nTDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2022 Form 10-K for a description of our\naccounting policies for TDRs that were in\neffect prior to adoption.\n\nLoan modifications to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, or FDMs, result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include\nprincipal forgiveness, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, payment delays,\nrepayment plans or combinations thereof. FDMs\ncontinue to be subject to our existing\nnonaccrual policies. Expected losses or\nrecoveries on FDMs have been factored into the\nALLL estimates for each loan class under the\nmethodologies described in this Note. Refer to\nNote 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses for more information on FDMs.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and\nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL\nand additional details on the composition of\nour loan portfolio:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note 1,\n\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses section of this\nNote 1,\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses in this Report, and\n\n\u2022 Note 4 Loans and Related

generally charge off commercial (commercial\nand industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform. For commercial\nloans and leases less than a defined dollar\nthreshold, balances are generally charged off\nin full after 180 days for loans and 120 days\nfor leases.\n\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell if the\nfair value is lower than the amortized cost\nbasis of the loan outstanding and the\ndelinquency of the loan, combined with other\nrisk factors such as bankruptcy or lien\nposition, indicates that the loan (or a\nportion thereof) is uncollectible as per our\nhistorical experience. These nonperforming\nloans would also be charged off when the\ncollateral has been repossessed. We charge off\nsecured consumer loans no later than 180 days\npast due. Most consumer loans and lines of\ncredit, not secured by automobiles or\nresidential real estate, are charged off once\nthey have reached 120-180 days past due.\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged off, resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 49\nadjustment to the ALLL to reflect the\nexpectation of recoveries in an amount greater\nthan previously expected, limited to amounts\npreviously charged-off.\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, depending on\nwhether the accrued interest has been\nincorporated into the ACL estimates, as\ndiscussed in the Accrued Interest section of\nthis Note 1, the accrued and uncollected\ninterest is either reversed through Net\ninterest income (if a CECL reserve is not\nmaintained for accrued interest) or charged\noff against the allowance (if a CECL reserve\nis maintained for accrued interest), except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of a charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance. Payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both the\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as fee and interest income. For\ncertain consumer loans, the receipt of\ninterest payments is recognized as interest\nincome on a cash basis. Cash basis income\nrecognition is applied if a loan\u2019s amortized\ncost basis is deemed fully collectible and the\nloan has performed for at least six months.\nFor loans modified due to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, payments\nare applied based upon their contractual terms\nunless the related loan is deemed\nnonperforming. Loans modified due to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally included in nonperforming and\nnonaccrual loans if they are not government\ninsured or guaranteed. However, after a\nreasonable period of time, generally six\nmonths, in which the loan performs under\nmodified terms and meets other performance\nindicators, it is returned to accruing status.\nThis return to accruing status demonstrates\nthat the bank expects to collect all of the\nloan\u2019s remaining contractual principal and\ninterest. Loan modifications granted to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nresulting from (i) borrowers that have been\ndischarged from personal liability through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally\nreaffirmed their loan obligations to us, and\n(ii) borrowers that are not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the modified terms are not\nreturned to accrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accruing status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the loan\u2019s\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collectability of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal may return to accruing status if the\nloan performs after a reasonable period of\ntime, generally six months, and the loan meets\nother performance indicators. Nonaccrual loans\nwith fully charged-off principal are\nprohibited from returning to accruing status.\nWhen a nonperforming loan is returned to\naccruing status, it is then considered a\nperforming loan.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\nresidential and commercial real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted, and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information on\nFDMs, nonperforming assets and credit quality\nindicators related to our loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL is based on historical loss\nexperience, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, equipment finance leases,\nother financial assets and unfunded lending\nrelated commitments, for the remaining\nestimated contractual term of the assets or\nexposures as of the balance sheet date. The\nremaining contractual term of assets in scope\nof CECL is estimated considering contractual\nmaturity dates, prepayment expectations,\nutilization or draw expectations and any\ncontractually embedded extension options that\ndo not allow us to unilaterally cancel the\nextension options. For products without a\nfixed contractual maturity date ( e.g .,\ncredit cards), we rely on historical payment\nbehavior to determine the length of the\npaydown or default time period.\n50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long-run\naverage expected losses, where applicable and\n(iii) the long-run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term. For\nall assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable.\n\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have currently determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward-looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, analysis\nfrom PNC economists and management judgment.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long-run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long-run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically one to three years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long-run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio and,\ntherefore, do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\n\nSee the following sections related to loans\nand leases and unfunded lending related\ncommitments for details about specific reserve\nmethodologies.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 51\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan, loan\nsegment or lease. We also consider the impact\nof prepayments and amortization on contractual\nmaturity in our expected loss estimates. We\nuse historical credit loss information,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables for the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\ncoupled with analytical methods, to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan, loan segment or\nlease. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario and\nthe long-run average period, and combined to\ngenerate expected loss estimates by scenario.\nThe following matrix provides key credit risk\ncharacteristics that we use to estimate these\nrisk parameters.\n                                              \n  Loan       Probabi\u2026    Loss       Exposure  \n  Class      of

period, we revert to the\nlong-run average over the reversion period\nnoted above, which is the period between the\nend of the forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong-run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long-run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate by loan class. We then add or deduct\nany qualitative components and other\nadjustments, such as individually assessed\nloans, to produce the ALLL. See the\nIndividually Assessed Component and\nQualitative Component discussions that follow\nin this Note 1 for additional information\nabout those adjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes.\nEffective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our\nuse of a discounted cash flow methodology, and\nwe now use a pooled expected loss methodology\nbased upon the quantification of risk\nparameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan\nor loan segment. See Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies in our 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndescription of our use of a discounted cash\nflow methodology prior to January 1, 2023.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold\nare reserved for under a pooled basis.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant expected credit risk\nfactors, the ACL also accounts for factors\nthat may not be directly measured in the\ndetermination of individually assessed or\npooled reserves. Such qualitative factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 53\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities section of Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K and\nthe Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note 1 for additional information on our\nnonaccrual and charge-off policies.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022\nForm 10-K for a description of the accounting\npolicies related to the applicable reserves on\naccrued interest for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023.\n\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition, as the\nestimated expected credit loss of the\noutstanding balance or par value, based on the\nmethodologies described previously for loans\nand securities. In accordance with CECL, the\nallowance recognized at acquisition is added\nto the acquisition date purchase price to\ndetermine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable ( e.g. , unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan\nand Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for\nthe key credit risk characteristics for\nunfunded lending related commitments. The\nallowance for unfunded lending related\ncommitments is recorded as a liability on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to\nthis reserve are included in the provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe have elected to apply the proportional\namortization method to our qualifying LIHTC\nand NMTC equity investments. Investment tax\ncredits and investment impairment are\nrecognized in tax expense for any individual\nLIHTC and NMTC equity investment for which we\ncan demonstrate that the investment was made\nprimarily for the purpose of receiving income\ntax credits and other income tax benefits. We\nuse the deferral method of accounting for all\nother tax credit investments. Under this\nmethod, the investment tax credits are\nrecognized as a reduction to the related\nasset.\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022 Provides                   \n                 optional                     \n                 expedients                   \n                 and                          \n                 exceptions     \u2022 ASU         \n                 for            2020-04 was   \n                 applying       adopted       \n                 generally      March 12,     \n                 accepted       2020.

The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $\n282million and $ 144million, respectively.\nThese amounts are included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 92million for securities\navailable for sale, primarily related to non-\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities,\nand $ 6million for securities held to maturity\nat September 30, 2023. The comparable amounts\nat December 31, 2022 were $ 142million and $\n7million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held to maturity securities transferred\nfrom available for sale are included in held\nto maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 4.4billion at September 30, 2023\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at September\n30, 2023 included less than $ 0.1billion of\nnet unsettled purchases that represent non-\ncash investing activity, and accordingly, are\nnot reflected on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. The comparable amount for\nSeptember 30, 2022 was $ 2.0billion of net\nunsettled purchases.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At September 30, 2023, the\nallowance for investment securities was $\n98million and primarily related to non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities in the\navailable for sale portfolio. The comparable\namount at December 31, 2022 was $ 149million.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022\nForm 10-K for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nAt September 30, 2023, AOCI included pretax\nlosses of $ 297million from derivatives that\nhedged the purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 37 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022. These securities\nare segregated between investments that had\nbeen in a continuous unrealized loss position\nfor less than twelve months and twelve months\nor more, based on the point in time that the\nfair value declined below the amortized cost\nbasis. All securities included in the table\nhave been evaluated to determine if a credit\n\n56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nloss exists. As part of that assessment, as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, we concluded that we do\nnot intend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 37: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

Loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option are reported\nas performing loans; however, when nonaccrual\ncriteria is met, interest income is not\nrecognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.

A variety of solutions are offered\nto borrowers, including loan modifications\nthat may result in principal forgiveness,\ninterest rate reductions, term extensions,\npayment delays, repayment plans or\ncombinations thereof:\n\n\u2022 Principal forgiveness includes principal and\naccrued interest forgiveness.\n\n\u2022 Interest rate reductions include\nmodifications where the interest rate is\nreduced and/or interest is deferred.\n\n\u2022 Term extensions extend the original\ncontractual maturity date of the loan.\n\n\u2022 Payment delays consist of modifications\nwhere we expect to collect contractual amounts\ndue but that result in a delay in the receipt\nof payments specified under the original loan\nterms. We generally consider payment delays to\nbe insignificant when the delay is three\nmonths or less.\n\n\u2022 Repayment plans are offered for some of our\ncredit card and unsecured line of credit\nproducts, which provide for a reduced payment\nand interest rate for a specific period of\ntime.\n\nAdditionally, modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir obligations to us, and those that enter\ninto trial modifications.\n\nFDMs exclude loans held for sale and loans\naccounted for under the fair value option.

These programs are\nstructurally similar such that the interest\nrate is reduced to a standard rate of 4.99%\nand the minimum payment percentage is adjusted\nto 1.90% of the outstanding balance.

In this program, we convert\nthe borrower\u2019s drawn and unpaid balances into\na fully-amortized repayment plan consisting of\nan interest rate of 4.99% and a minimum\npayment amount of 1.90%.

Our continuing involvement in the\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, Non-\nagency securitizations and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing,\nrepurchasing previously transferred loans\nunder certain conditions and loss share\narrangements, and, in limited circumstances,\nholding of mortgage-backed securities issued\nby the securitization SPEs.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 8 Commitments\nand Note 11 Fair Value for information on our\nservicing rights, including the carrying value\nof servicing assets.\nThe following table provides our loan sale and\nservicing activities:\nTable 51: Loan Sale and Servicing Activities\n                                              \n  In                                          \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Cash                                        \n  Flo\u2026                                        \n  -

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 4.0billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and $ 3.4billion at\nDecember 31, 2022, and consisted of loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential mortgages which are measured at\nfair value.\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. MSRs are subject to\nchanges in value from actual or expected\nprepayment of the underlying loans and\ndefaults, as well as market driven changes in\ninterest rates. We manage this risk by\neconomically hedging the fair value of MSRs\nwith securities, derivative instruments and\nresale agreements, which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 5 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 73\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 55 and 56. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 15 Fair Value in our 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nFor more information on the valuation\nmethodologies used to measure assets and\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, see Note 15 Fair Value in our 2022 Form\n10-K.

Derivatives represent contracts\nbetween parties that usually require little or\nno initial net investment and result in one\nparty delivering cash or another type of asset\nto the other party based on a notional amount\nand an underlying as specified in the\ncontract.\n\nDerivative transactions are often measured in\nterms of notional amount, but this amount is\ngenerally not exchanged and it is not recorded\non the balance sheet. The notional amount is\nthe basis to which the underlying is applied\nto determine required payments under the\nderivative contract. The underlying is a\nreferenced interest rate, security price,\ncredit spread or other index. Residential and\ncommercial real estate loan commitments\nassociated with loans to be sold also qualify\nas derivative instruments.\n\nFor more information regarding derivatives see\nNote 1 Accounting Policies and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nT able 73 presents the notional and gross fair\nvalue amounts of all derivative assets and\nliabilities held by us.\n\nDuring the second quarter, in anticipation of\nLIBOR\u2019s cessation on June 30, 2023, LIBOR-\nindexed interest-rate swap contracts with\ncentral clearing counterparties were subject\nto a conversion process whereby an individual\nLIBOR swap contract was exchanged for a SOFR\nreplacement swap contract, along with one or\nmore overlay swap contracts replicating the\nfinal LIBOR cash flows on the original swap\ncontract. The swap contracts exchanged were\nsubstantially economically equivalent.\nConversion-related valuation differences were\nsettled in cash on the conversion dates and\nwere not material. The SOFR replacement and\noverlay swaps are considered separate\ncontracts, and the overlay swaps will result\nin a gross-up of the notional amounts\npresented until those swaps mature upon\nsettlement of the final LIBOR payment. The\nmajority of overlay swaps matured during the\nthird quarter of 2023.\n\nTable 73: Total Gross Derivatives (a)\n                                              \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026              1    \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026    $              \n                          \u2026    $         1    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026    $         1    \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026              6    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                                              \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                                              \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                          \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                               $         \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Centrally cleared derivatives are settled\nin cash daily and result in no derivative\nasset or derivative liability being recognized\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet .\n\n(b) Included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(c) Included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(d) Represents primarily swaps.\n\n(e) Represents caps and floors.\n\n(f) Includes both residential and commercial\nmortgage banking activities.\n\n(g) At September 30, 2023, the gross-up of the\nnotional amounts due to overlay swap contracts\nused for mortgage banking and customer-related\nactivities were $ 0.4billion and $\n22.6billion, respectively\n\n(h) Futures contracts are settled in cash\ndaily and result in no derivative asset or\nderivative liability being recognized on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 91\nAll derivatives are carried on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.\nDerivative balances are presented on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis\ntaking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand, when appropriate, any related cash\ncollateral exchanged with counterparties.\nFurther discussion regarding the offsetting\nrights associated with these legally\nenforceable master netting agreements is\nincluded in the Offsetting and Counterparty\nCredit Risk section of this Note 12. Any\nnonperformance risk, including credit risk, is\nincluded in the determination of the estimated\nnet fair value of the derivatives.\n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk as part of our\nasset and liability risk management activities\nare designated as accounting hedges.\nDerivatives hedging the risks associated with\nchanges in the fair value of assets or\nliabilities are considered fair value hedges,\nderivatives hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are considered cash\nflow hedges and derivatives hedging a net\ninvestment in a foreign subsidiary are\nconsidered net investment hedges. Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow September 30,\n2023, we expect to reclassify net derivative\nlosses of $ 1.5billion pretax, or $ 1.1billion\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to September 30,\n2023. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is eight years.\n\n92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting and counterparty credit risk, see\nNote 16 Financial Derivatives in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nTable 77 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nThe table includes cash collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements.

These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The following table\npresents the aggregate fair value of\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features, the associated\ncollateral posted in the normal course of\nbusiness and the maximum amount of collateral\nwe would be required to post if the credit-\nrisk-related contingent features underlying\nthese agreements had been triggered on\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nTable 78: Credit-Risk Contingent Features\n                                              \n  In              September         December  \n  billions         30, 2023         31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net                                         \n  derivati\u2026                                   \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n  with         $        6.5    $         5.8  \n  credit-r\u2026                                   \n  continge\u2026                                   \n  features                                    \n  Collater\u2026             1.7              1.7  \n  posted                                      \n  Maximum                                     \n  addition\u2026                                   \n  amount of    $        4.8    $         4.1  \n  collater\u2026                                   \n  exposure                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  13 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K, in\nNote 13 Legal Proceedings in our first quarter\n2023 Form 10-Q and in Note 13 Legal\nProceedings in our second quarter 2023 Form\n10-Q (such prior disclosure referred to as\n\u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters\nwhere we are able to estimate such possible\nlosses or ranges of possible losses, as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, we estimate that it is\nreasonably possible that we could incur losses\nin excess of related accrued liabilities, if\nany, in an aggregate amount less than $\n300million. The estimates included in this\namount are based on our analysis of currently\navailable information and are subject to\nsignificant judgment and a variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties. As new\ninformation is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the Disclosed Matters, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\n96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nIn September 2023, Visa announced proposed\namendments to its Certificate of Incorporation\nto institute, if approved by stockholders, an\nexchange offer program that would initially\nconvert Visa\u2019s Class B common stock to Class\nB-1 common stock and release transfer\nrestrictions on up to 50% of the Class B-1\ncommon stock. By participating in the program,\na holder of Class B-1 common stock would have\nthe ability to exchange up to half of its\nClass B-1 common stock into Visa\u2019s Class C\ncommon stock. Subject to certain restrictions,\nthe Class C shares could then be converted\ninto Visa\u2019s Class A shares at the then-\napplicable conversion rate, which, subject to\nlock-up periods, could be sold on the open\nmarket. The exchanges would be subject to the\napplicable stockholder agreeing to make-whole\nagreements that would subject them to the same\nindemnity obligations to Visa as are currently\npresent. Three additional such exchanges\ntaking place no less than one year apart, and\npermitting a holder of Visa\u2019s Class B-1 common\nstock to exchange up to half of its then held\nClass B-1 common stock into Visa\u2019s Class C\ncommon stock, would be possible but not\nguaranteed.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn July 2023, both PNC and USAA appealed the\nFinal Written Decision of the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board that held unpatentable many of\nthe claims of the patent presented to the jury\nin United Services Automobile Association v.\nPNC Bank N.A. (Case No. 2:21-cv-246) (the\n\u201cthird Texas case\u201d). It held that other claims\nof that patent were patentable. With respect\nto the other patent originally at issue in the\nthird Texas case and subject to inter partes\nreview by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board,\nin August 2023, USAA appealed the Final\nWritten Decision of the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board that held all of the claims\nunpatentable. This second patent was not\npresented to the jury in the third Texas case.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 97\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income.\nThese differences are reflected in the \u201cOther\u201d\ncategory in Table 79. \u201cOther\u201d includes\nresidual activities that do not meet the\ncriteria for disclosure as a separate\nreportable business, such as asset and\nliability management activities, including net\nsecurities gains or losses, ACL for investment\nsecurities, certain trading activities,\ncertain runoff consumer loan portfolios,\nprivate equity investments, intercompany\neliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax\nadjustments that are not allocated to business\nsegments, exited businesses and differences\nbetween business segment performance reporting\nand financial statement reporting (GAAP).\nAssets, revenue and earnings attributable to\nforeign activities were not material in the\nperiods presented for comparison. The declines\nin earnings for the three months ended and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 when\ncompared to the same periods in 2022 for the\n\u201cOther\u201d category were primarily due to\ninternal funds transfer pricing impacts\nbetween business segments.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstandalone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors.\n\nWe have allocated the ALLL and the allowance\nfor unfunded lending related commitments based\non the loan exposures within each business\nsegment\u2019s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions\nand estimation processes react to and are\ninfluenced by observed changes in loan\nportfolio performance experience, the\nfinancial strength of the borrower and\neconomic conditions.

Under the proposal, the FDIC\nwould collect from PNC, along with other BHCs\nand insured depository institutions, special\nassessments at an annual rate of 12.5 basis\npoints of PNC\u2019s uninsured deposits reported as\nof December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the\nfirst $5.0 billion), over eight quarterly\nassessment periods, beginning after the first\nquarter 2024. We expect the FDIC will enact a\nspecial deposit insurance assessment that will\nsignificantly increase our FDIC deposit\ninsurance costs. The total cost and timing is\nsubject to the pending finalization of the\nassessment.\n\nProposed Expanded Risk-Based Capital Rules\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC,\nand FDIC proposed for public comment an\ninteragency rule to implement the final\ncomponents of the Basel III framework that\nwould significantly revise the capital\nrequirements for large banking organizations,\nincluding PNC and PNC Bank. The proposed rule\nwill apply an expanded risk-based approach\nwhich leverages the Basel rules, including the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets, in\naddition to the current U.S. standardized\napproach. In addition, this proposal would\nalign the regulatory capital elements and\nrequired deductions for Category III banking\norganizations such as PNC and PNC Bank with\nthose currently applicable to Category I and\nII banking organizations. PNC and PNC Bank\nwould be required to recognize most elements\nof AOCI in regulatory capital and deduct from\nCET1 capital, among other items, mortgage\nservicing assets and deferred tax assets that\nindividually exceed 10% of CET1 capital or in\nthe aggregate with other threshold items that\nexceed 15% of CET1 capital . PNC and PNC Bank\nwould be required to calculate their risk-\nbased capital ratios under the existing\nstandardized approach and the expanded risk-\nbased approach and would be subject to the\nlower of the two resulting ratios for their\nrisk-based capital minimums and buffer\nrequirements, including the SCB.

In light of the Federal banking agencies\nproposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, share repurchase activity was\npaused in the third quarter of 2023 and is\nexpected to remain paused during the fourth\nquarter of 2023. PNC continues to evaluate the\npotential impact of the proposed rules and may\nresume share repurchase activity depending on\nmarket and economic conditions, as well as\nother factors. PNC's SCB for the four-quarter\nperiod beginning October 1, 2023 is the\nregulatory minimum of 2.5%.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 5.
