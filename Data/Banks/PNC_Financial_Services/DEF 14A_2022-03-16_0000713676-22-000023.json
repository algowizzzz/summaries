The company continued to execute on\nits strategic priorities \u2014 growing\norganically, innovating with the help of\nsubstantial technology investments and\nstrengthening customer relationships. All this\nprogress was made amid an evolving banking\nindustry and shifting employment landscape.\n\nAs PNC's lead independent director, and on\nbehalf of the whole board, I want to thank you\nfor your support and extend our gratitude to\nall of the nearly 59,000 PNC employees, whose\ndedication and hard work allow PNC to make a\ndifference for everyone we serve. Here are a\nfew of the company's key achievements made\npossible by these employees:\n\n\u2022 As a result of the BBVA USA acquisition, PNC\ngained 2.6 million customers, 9,000 employees\nand more than 600 branches. The massive effort\nto combine the organizations gives PNC the\nscale needed to continue to compete on a\nnational level.\n\n\u2022 PNC expanded its presence on the West Coast\nfrom San Diego to Seattle and across the\nsouthern border through Arizona, New Mexico\nand Colorado and throughout Texas, placing the\ncompany in all of the country's 30 largest\nmarkets.\n\n\u2022 Through innovative product launches,\nstrategic acquisitions and industry\npartnerships, PNC intensified its competitive\nefforts in the rapidly evolving digital\nbanking market. To digitally empower our\nretail customers, PNC launched Low Cash Mode\u00ae,\narguably the most important product ever\ndeveloped by PNC and a model for the industry.\nLow Cash Mode\u00ae helps customers avoid overdraft\nfees through unprecedented account\ntransparency and control. In digital payment\nsolutions, PNC acquired Tempus Technologies\nand BBVA USA's cross-border payments business,\nrenamed PNC Global Transfers. And in digital\nfinancial data aggregation, PNC integrated\nwith Akoya Data Access Network to help create\na safer banking environment for consumers and\nbusinesses.\n\n\u2022 To further strengthen our communities, PNC\nexpanded its previous pledges and announced a\nfour-year Community Benefits Plan to provide\n$88 billion in loans, investments and other\nfinancial support to low- and moderate-income\npeople and neighborhoods, as well as people\nand communities of color.\n\n\u2022 To help PNC employees thrive, and to retain\nand attract talent in a challenging\nmarketplace, the company introduced Paid\nFamily Leave and increased the minimum pay\nrate to $18 per hour.\n\nThese accomplishments reflect PNC's strong\ncore values and relentless focus on doing the\nright thing for customers, employees,\ncommunities and shareholders.\n\nAs always, the board worked hard to fulfill\nits fiduciary duty. We held 60 board and\ncommittee meetings and maintained a regular\nand constructive dialogue with regulators.\nNotable areas of focus for the board in 2021\nincluded the BBVA USA acquisition and\nintegration, the company's strategy for\ncompeting with fintechs and the deployment of\nPNC's $88 billion Community Benefits Plan.\n                                              \n  Environmental, Social and Governance        \n  Progress                                    \n                                              \nThe board remains deeply committed to PNC's\nenvironmental, social and governance (\"ESG\")\nefforts and believes that PNC's ability to\neffectively manage such issues, including\nsupporting the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, is critical to our ability to compete\nin the 21st century economy.\n\nWhile the full board continues to have\nultimate oversight of PNC's strategy,\nincluding the risks and opportunities flowing\nfrom ESG matters, we enhanced our governance\nby assigning specific oversight responsibility\nfor elements of PNC's ESG efforts to each of\nour board committees. For example, the board's\nRisk Committee has explicit oversight of\nclimate-related\n\nTable of Contents\n\nrisks, our Special Committee on Equity &\nInclusion has oversight of social justice and\neconomic empowerment efforts, and our Audit\nCommittee oversees PNC's environmental and\nsocial disclosures.\n\nPNC made considerable progress last year\nacross the full ESG spectrum, including\npublishing its first unabridged Equal\nEmployment Opportunity (\"EEO-1\") report and\nits inaugural Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") report. The\nEEO-1 report provides detailed information on\nour workforce demographics, and the TCFD\nreport gives investors relevant and actionable\ninformation on how PNC manages climate risk\nand opportunity.\n                                              \n  Leadership Diversity                        \n                                              \nAs with PNC's efforts to increase broad\nworkforce diversity, we have taken steps to\nensure that leadership has the diverse\nperspectives and experience we need to make\nthe best decisions and have the greatest\nimpact. PNC's Executive Committee, which\nreports to CEO Bill Demchak, is 42% women and\n25% people of color. The 12 independent\ndirectors nominated for election are 33% women\nand 25% people of color.\n\nThe board remains confident in PNC's direction\nand is more optimistic than ever about what\nthe expanded company can achieve in the coming\nyears.\n                                              \n  With Gratitude for Board Contributions      \n                                              \nI want to thank Chuck Bunch, who is retiring\nfrom our board and whose leadership over the\npast 15 years has been invaluable. I also want\nto thank David Cohen, who resigned from our\nboard last year to serve as U.S. Ambassador to\nCanada. Their leadership will have a lasting\nimpact on PNC, and I could not be more\ngrateful for their service.\n\nThank you again for your support and trust. On\nbehalf of the PNC board, I hope you have a\nsafe, healthy and prosperous year.\n                                              \n  March 16,                                   \n  2022                            Sincerely,  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                  Andrew                      \n                  Feldstein                   \n                  Presiding                   \n                  Director                    \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nPARTICIPATE IN THE FUTURE OF PNC \u2014 PLEASE CAST\nYOUR VOTE\n\nYour vote is important to us and we want your\nshares to be represented at the annual\nmeeting.

The amounts shown in the \"Stock\nAwards\" column of the Summary compensation\ntable differ slightly from the amounts shown\nin the table above due to the impact of\nrounding related to fractional shares. PNC\ncorporate governance (page 16) \u2022 The entire\nBoard is elected each year; we have no\nstaggered elections. \u2022 The election of\ndirectors is subject to a majority voting\nrequirement; any director who does not receive\na majority of the votes cast in an uncontested\nelection must tender his or her resignation to\nthe Board. \u2022 Our corporate governance\nguidelines require the Board to have a\nsubstantial majority (at least two-thirds) of\nindependent directors. All but one of our\ncurrent directors and all but one of the\nnominees to the Board are independent, with\nthe only exception in each case being our CEO.\n\u2022 The Board has a Presiding Director, a lead\nindependent director with specific duties. \u2022\nThe Presiding Director approves Board meeting\nagendas. \u2022 The Board meets regularly in\nexecutive session, with no members of\nmanagement present. \u2022 We have four primary\nBoard committees: \u2013 Audit Committee \u2013 Human\nResources Committee \u2013 Nominating and\nGovernance Committee \u2013 Risk Committee \u2022 The\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee has been\nrenamed the \"Human Resources Committee\" to\nbetter reflect the scope of the Committee's\nresponsibilities and areas of oversight. \u2022 The\nAudit Committee, Human Resources Committee and\nNominating and Governance Committee are each\ncomprised entirely of directors who are\nindependent under applicable standards. \u2022 The\nRisk Committee has formed two subcommittees: \u2013\nCompliance Subcommittee \u2013 Technology\nSubcommittee \u2022 We also have a Special\nCommittee on Equity & Inclusion. \u2022 The Board\nhas delegated environmental, social and\ngovernance (\"ESG\") oversight responsibilities\nto its committees based on the expertise of\neach committee. \u2022 Under the Board's oversight\nPNC continued to focus on its commitment to\nESG matters, including by investing in our\nemployees, supporting our communities and\nfocusing on sustainability. \u2022 In 2021, the\nBoard met 11 times. Each director attended at\nleast 75% of the aggregate number of meetings\nof the Board and all committees of the Board\non which he or she served, and the average\nattendance of all directors at Board and\napplicable committee meetings was over 99%.\nAll of our directors then serving attended our\n2021 annual meeting of shareholders. \u2022 You can\nfind additional information about our\ngovernance

The Special Committee has met\nregularly since its inception.\n\nOur Bylaws also provide that the Board may\nauthorize the establishment of subcommittees.\nThe Board has formed a Technology Subcommittee\nof the Risk Committee to facilitate Board-\nlevel oversight of technology risk,\ncybersecurity (including cyber fraud),\ninformation security, physical security,\nbusiness continuity and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs, including those that\ncan position the use of technology to drive\nstrategic advantages. The Board has also\nformed a Compliance Subcommittee of the Risk\nCommittee to facilitate Board-level oversight\nof compliance risk, significant compliance-\nrelated initiatives and programs, and the\nmaintenance of a strong compliance risk\nmanagement culture.\n\nEach committee operates under a written\ncharter approved by the Board, and each\nsubcommittee operates under a written charter\napproved by the Risk Committee.

The Board has determined that each\nAudit Committee member is financially\nliterate. The Board made this determination in\nits business judgment, based on its\ninterpretation of the NYSE\u2019s requirements for\naudit committee members. Acting on the\nrecommendation of the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee, the Board has determined\nthat each of Mr. Alvarado, Ms. Cafaro, Mr.\nHarshman and Mr. Pfinsgraff is an \u201caudit\ncommittee financial expert\u201d as that term is\ndefined by the SEC, and that each possesses\naccounting or related financial management\nexpertise under applicable NYSE rules. The\nBoard expects to determine that Mr. Niblock is\nan \"audit committee financial expert\" at its\norganizational meeting on April 27, 2022.

The Audit\nCommittee\u2019s primary purposes are to assist the\nBoard by: \u2022 Monitoring the integrity of our\nconsolidated financial statements \u2022 Monitoring\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting \u2022 Monitoring compliance\nwith our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics \u2022\nOverseeing conduct risk management \u2022\nEvaluating a periodic, independent assessment\nof a subsidiary bank's overall risk governance\nand risk management practices \u2022 Monitoring\ncompliance with certain legal and regulatory\nrequirements \u2022 Evaluating and monitoring the\nqualifications and independence of our\nindependent auditors \u2022 Evaluating and\nmonitoring the performance of our internal\naudit function and our independent auditors \u2022\nOverseeing our key ESG disclosures The Audit\nCommittee also performs the duties required by\nlaw to be performed by a fiduciary audit\ncommittee for any national bank subsidiary of\nPNC to the extent permitted and in the manner\nrequired by applicable laws and regulations.\nAt each quarterly meeting of the full Board,\nthe chair of the Audit Committee presents a\nreport of the items discussed and actions\napproved at previous meetings of the\nCommittee. The Audit Committee\u2019s\nresponsibility is one of oversight. Management\nis responsible for preparing our consolidated\nfinancial statements, for maintaining internal\ncontrols and for our compliance with laws and\nregulations, and the independent auditors are\nresponsible for auditing our consolidated\nfinancial statements. The Committee is\nresponsible for holding management accountable\nfor establishing and maintaining an adequate\nand effective internal control system and\nprocesses. The Committee typically approves\nthe internal and external audit plans, and\nreviews and discusses audit reports and\nresults with representatives of our internal\naudit function and our independent auditors.\nThe Committee also receives periodic reports\non our compliance with applicable disclosure-\nrelated ESG laws and regulations, and\ndiscusses with management applicable internal\nand disclosure controls related to our key ESG\ndisclosures. In addition, the Committee\nreceives, reviews and discusses with\nmanagement at least annually a report on PNC's\npolitical activity,\n                                              \n  18    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nincluding its major lobbying priorities,\nparticipation in national trade associations\nand contributions to politically involved\norganizations, and the oversight and\ngovernance of PNC's political activities.\n\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to\nretain independent legal, accounting, economic\nor other advisors.

The independent auditors report\ndirectly to the Committee. We describe the\nrole of the Committee as it relates to the\nindependent auditors, including consideration\nof the rotation of the independent audit firm,\nin more detail on page 83.\n\nWith respect to work performed by the\nindependent auditors, the Audit Committee must\napprove all audit engagement fees and terms,\nas well as all permitted non-audit\nengagements. The Committee (or its delegate)\npre-approves all audit services, audit-related\nservices and permitted non-audit services to\nbe performed by the independent auditors. The\nCommittee also considers whether the provision\nof any audit services, audit-related services\nor permitted non-audit services will impair\nthe auditors\u2019 independence. We describe the\nCommittee\u2019s procedures for the pre-approval of\naudit services, audit-related services and\npermitted non-audit services on page 84.\n\nThe Audit Committee receives periodic reports\non finance, reserve adequacy, ethics, and\ninternal and external audit.\n\nThe Audit Committee also appoints our General\nAuditor, who leads our internal audit function\nand is functionally accountable to the\nCommittee. The Committee holds regular\nexecutive sessions with management, the\nGeneral Auditor, the Chief Ethics Officer and\nthe independent auditors. The Committee\nreviews the performance and approves the\ncompensation of the General Auditor, and\nannually reviews the General Auditor\nsuccession plan with the CEO and the Board.\n\nUnder our corporate governance guidelines,\nAudit Committee members may serve on the audit\ncommittees of no more than three public\ncompanies at the same time, including PNC.\n\nThe Audit Committee has approved the report on\npage 85 as required under its charter and in\naccordance with SEC regulations.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2022                             19  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nNominating and Governance Committee\n                                              \n              Chair                Other      \n                                   members:   \n  Andrew               Charles                \n  T.

The Board most\nrecently approved the charter of the\nNominating and Governance Committee on\nNovember 10, 2021, and it is available on our\nwebsite at www.pnc.com/corporategovernance. At\neach quarterly meeting of the full Board, the\nchair of the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee presents a report of the items\ndiscussed and actions approved at previous\nmeetings of the Committee. The primary purpose\nof the Nominating and Governance Committee is\nto assist the Board in promoting the best\ninterests of PNC and its shareholders through\nthe implementation of sound corporate\ngovernance principles and practices. The\nCommittee also assists the Board by\nidentifying individuals qualified to become\nBoard members. The Committee recommends to the\nBoard the director nominees for each annual\nmeeting of shareholders, and may also\nrecommend the appointment of qualified\nindividuals as directors between annual\nmeetings. The Committee also oversees our\nengagement with shareholders regarding ESG\nmatters. In addition to conducting its annual\ncommittee self-evaluation, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee oversees the annual\nevaluation of the performance of the Board and\nother Board committees and reports to the\nBoard on the evaluation results as necessary\nor appropriate. The Committee also annually\nreviews and recommends any changes to the\nExecutive Committee charter. How we evaluate\ndirectors and director candidates . At least\nannually, the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee assesses the skills, qualifications\nand experience of our directors and recommends\na slate of director nominees to the Board. In\nevaluating existing directors and new director\ncandidates, the Committee assesses the needs\nof the Board and the qualifications of the\nindividual. From time to time, the Committee\nalso considers whether to change the\ncomposition of the Board. See the discussion\non pages 8 to 15 for additional information\nregarding each of our current director\nnominees. The Board and its committees must\nsatisfy SEC, NYSE and banking regulatory\nstandards. At least a majority of our\ndirectors must be independent under NYSE\nstandards. Our corporate governance guidelines\nimpose a more rigorous standard and require\nthat a substantial majority (at least two-\nthirds) of our directors be independent. We\nrequire a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors to satisfy the membership needs of\nBoard committees that also require\nindependence. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee expects directors to gain a sound\nunderstanding of our strategic vision, our mix\nof businesses and our approach to regulatory\nrelations and risk management. The Board must\npossess a mix of qualities and skills adequate\nto address the various risks facing PNC. For a\ndiscussion of the Board\u2019s oversight of risk,\nsee Corporate Governance\u2014Board committees\u2014Risk\nCommittee on page 27. When evaluating each\ndirector, as well as new director candidates\nfor nomination, the Committee considers the\nfollowing criteria set forth in our corporate\ngovernance guidelines: \u2022 A sustained record of\nhigh achievement in financial services,\nbusiness, industry, government, academia, the\nprofessions, or civic, charitable or non-\nprofit organizations \u2022 Manifest competence and\nintegrity \u2022 A strong commitment to the ethical\nand diligent pursuit of our stakeholders' best\ninterests, including our customers,\ncommunities, employees and shareholders \u2022 The\nstrength of character necessary to challenge\nmanagement\u2019s recommendations and actions when\nappropriate and to confirm the adequacy and\ncompleteness of management\u2019s responses to such\nchallenges to his or her satisfaction \u2022 The\nBoard\u2019s strong desire to continue adding\ndiversity in terms of race, gender,\nprofessional background, life experience and\nsocial identity \u2022 Personal qualities that will\nhelp to sustain an atmosphere of mutual\nrespect and collegiality among the members of\nthe Board\n                                              \n  20    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee also\nconsiders the current needs of the Board and\nits committees, meeting attendance and\nparticipation, and the value of a director\u2019s\ncontribution to the effectiveness of the Board\nand its committees.\n\nAlthough the Board has not adopted a formal\npolicy on diversity, the Board recognizes the\nvalue of a diverse Board. Therefore, the\nNominating and Governance Committee considers\nthe diversity of directors in the context of\nthe Board\u2019s overall needs, including the\ndiversity of perspective, experience,\nknowledge, education, age and skills of each\ndirector. The Committee evaluates diversity in\na broad sense, recognizing the benefits of\ndemographic and cognitive diversity, and the\nbreadth of diverse backgrounds, skills and\nexperiences the directors bring to the Board.\n                                              \n  How we identify new directors               \n                                              \n. The Nominating and Governance Committee\nutilizes as a discussion tool a matrix of\ncertain skills and experiences the Committee\nbelieves would be beneficial to have\nrepresented on the Board and its committees.\nThe Committee considers PNC's strategy and\nindustry trends in developing a view of those\nskills and characteristics that would benefit\nthe Board. The Committee is also focused on\nwhat skills are required or beneficial for\nthose serving in key Board positions such as\ncommittee chairs, and considers succession\nplanning for those positions. The Committee\nleverages the matrix, and considers the Board-\napproved evaluation criteria and various\nregulatory requirements described above, when\nidentifying potential director candidates,\nwhich it does in a number of ways. The\nCommittee periodically retains a search firm\nto identify candidates. The Committee may\nconsider recommendations made by our current\nor former directors or members of executive\nmanagement. The Committee may also identify\npotential directors through contacts in the\nbusiness, civic, academic, legal and non-\nprofit communities.\n\nIn addition, the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee will consider director candidates\nrecommended by our shareholders for nomination\nat the next year\u2019s annual meeting of\nshareholders. For the Committee to consider a\ndirector candidate recommended by a\nshareholder, the shareholder must submit the\nrecommendation in writing to the Corporate\nSecretary at our principal executive offices.\nThe submission must include the information\ndescribed under \u201cDirector Nomination Process\u201d\nin Section 3 of our corporate governance\nguidelines, which can be found at\nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance . To be\nconsidered for the 2023 annual meeting of\nshareholders, the submission must be received\nby November 16, 2022.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will\nevaluate director candidates recommended by a\nshareholder in the same manner as candidates\nidentified by the Committee or recommended by\nothers. The Committee will not consider any\ncandidate with an obvious impediment to\nserving as one of our directors.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will\nmeet to review and discuss relevant available\ninformation regarding a director candidate,\nconsidering the Board-approved evaluation\ncriteria, the candidate's contribution to the\ndiversity of the Board and PNC's evolving\nstrategic needs. If the Committee decides not\nto recommend a candidate for nomination or\nappointment, or for additional evaluation, no\nfurther action is taken, and in the case of a\nshareholder-recommended candidate, the\nCorporate Secretary will communicate the\ndecision to the shareholder.\n\nIf the Nominating and Governance Committee\ndecides to recommend a director candidate to\nthe Board as a nominee for election at an\nannual meeting of shareholders or for\nappointment by the Board, the Chair of the\nCommittee will report that decision to the\nfull Board. Following a discussion regarding\nthe recommendation, the full Board will vote\non whether to nominate the candidate for\nelection or appoint the candidate to the\nBoard, as applicable. Invitations to join the\nBoard are extended by the Chair of the Board\nand the Presiding Director, jointly acting on\nbehalf of the Board.\n\nShareholders who wish to nominate a director\ncandidate directly at an annual meeting of\nshareholders or nominate and include a\ndirector candidate in our annual meeting proxy\nmaterials must do so in accordance with the\nprocedures contained in our Bylaws, as\ndescribed in Shareholder Proposals for the\n2023 Annual Meeting on page 94 under the\nheadings Advance notice procedures and Proxy\naccess procedures, respectively.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        21  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nHuman Resources Committee\n                                              \n              Chair                Other      \n                                   members:   \n  Charles              Debra A.               \n  E.

The\nHuman Resources Committee consists entirely of\nindependent directors. The Committee\nmembership is intended to satisfy the\nindependence standards established by\napplicable federal income tax and securities\nlaws, as well as NYSE standards. As Mr. Bunch\nhas reached the Board-established mandatory\nretirement age, he will not stand for re-\nelection to the Board at the annual meeting,\nand following the annual meeting will no\nlonger be a member of the Committee. When the\nBoard meets on April 27, 2022 to organize its\ncommittees, only independent directors will be\nappointed to the Committee, including to the\nposition of chair of the Committee. The Board\nmost recently approved the charter of the\nHuman Resources Committee on November 10,\n2021, and it is available on our website at\nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. The Human\nResources Committee\u2019s principal purpose is to\ndischarge the Board\u2019s responsibilities\nrelating to the compensation of our executive\nofficers and other specified responsibilities\nrelated to human resources matters affecting\nPNC. The Committee may also oversee and\napprove, or recommend for approval, employee\nbenefit, bonus, incentive compensation,\nseverance, equity-based or other compensation\nor incentive plans or arrangements. The Human\nResources Committee has the authority to\nretain independent legal, compensation,\naccounting or other advisors. The charter\nprovides the Committee with the sole authority\nto retain and terminate an independent\ncompensation consultant acting on the\nCommittee\u2019s behalf, and to approve the\nconsultant\u2019s fees and other retention terms.\nThe Committee retained an independent\ncompensation consultant in 2021 and prior\nyears. See Role of compensation consultants\nbelow. The Human Resources Committee reviews\nwith management the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis section of the proxy statement,\nwhich begins on page 41. The required report\nof the Committee is included under\nCompensation Committee Report on page 62. The\nCommittee also evaluates the relationship\nbetween risk management and our incentive\ncompensation programs and plans. See\nCompensation and Risk beginning on page 63.\nThe Human Resources Committee has\nresponsibility for overseeing our programs,\npolicies and practices related to talent and\nhuman capital strategy, including those\nrelated to our commitment to diversity, equity\nand inclusion (to the extent not within the\npurview of the Special Committee on Equity &\nInclusion), the recruitment, development and\nretention of talent, employee engagement,\nhealth, safety and well-being, and corporate\nculture. The Committee is also responsible for\noverseeing and evaluating our executive\nmanagement succession plan (except for the\nreview and evaluation of the succession plans\nfor the General Auditor and Chief Risk\nOfficer, which are performed by the Audit\nCommittee and the Risk Committee,\nrespectively). The executive management\nsuccession plan, including for the CEO, is\nalso reviewed with the full Board from time to\ntime. The Committee reviews a detailed\nsuccession planning report at least annually.\nThe materials in the report typically include\na discussion of the individual performance of\neach executive officer, as well as succession\nplans and development initiatives for other\nemerging talent. These materials provide\nnecessary background and context to the\nCommittee, and give the Committee members a\nfamiliarity with each employee\u2019s position,\nduties, responsibilities and performance. How\nwe make decisions . The Human Resources\nCommittee meets at least four times a year.\nBefore each meeting, the chair of the\nCommittee reviews the agenda, materials and\nissues with members of management and the\nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation\nconsultant, as appropriate. The Committee may\ninvite legal counsel or other external\nconsultants to advise the Committee during\nmeetings and preparatory sessions. The Human\nResources Committee regularly meets in\nexecutive sessions without management present.\nAt each quarterly meeting of the full Board,\nthe chair of the Committee presents a report\nof the items discussed and actions approved at\nprevious meetings of the Committee. The Human\nResources Committee has adopted guidelines for\ninformation that will be presented to the\nCommittee. The guidelines contemplate, among\nother things, that any material change to a\ncompensation program, plan or arrangement will\nbe considered over the course of at least two\nseparate meetings of the Committee, with any\nvote occurring no earlier than the second\nmeeting.\n                                              \n  22    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nThe Human Resources Committee reviews all of\nthe elements of our compensation programs\nperiodically and adjusts those programs as\nappropriate. Each year, the Committee makes\ndecisions regarding the amount of annual\ncompensation and equity-based or other longer-\nterm compensation for our executive officers\nand other designated senior employees. For the\nmost part, these decisions are made in the\nfirst quarter of each year, following an\nevaluation of the prior year\u2019s performance.\n                                              \n  Delegations of authority                    \n                                              \n. The Human Resources Committee has delegated\nauthority to management to make certain\ndecisions or take certain actions with respect\nto compensation or benefit plans or\narrangements, other than those that are solely\nor predominantly for the benefit of executive\nofficers. For employee benefit, bonus,\nincentive compensation, severance, equity-\nbased and other compensation or incentive\nplans and arrangements, the Committee has\ndelegated to the Chief Human Resources Officer\n(or her designee) the ability to adopt a new\nplan or arrangement or amend an existing one\nif:\n\n\u2022 the adoption or amendment is not expected to\nresult in a significant increase in\nincremental expense to PNC (defined as an\nincremental annual expense that exceeds $50\nmillion for that plan category), the plan is\nbroadly available to employees of PNC and the\nnew plan or amendment would not confer a\ndisproportionate benefit upon executives; or\n\n\u2022 the new plan or amendment is of a technical\nor administrative nature, is required by a\nchange in applicable law, is not otherwise\nmaterial or, with respect to employee benefit\nplans, will not result in a significant impact\non PNC's overall employee benefits program.\n\nThis delegation also includes the authority to\ntake certain actions to implement, administer,\ninterpret or construe, or make eligibility\ndeterminations under, the plans and\narrangements, including the ability to appoint\na plan manager, administrator or committee and\nto adopt policies and procedures with respect\nto the plan, except with respect to plans that\nare overseen by PNC's administrative committee\nunder its charter.\n\nFor grants of equity or equity-based awards,\nthe Human Resources Committee has delegated to\nthe CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer\n(or the designee of either) the responsibility\nto make decisions with respect to equity\ngrants for individuals who are not designated\nby the Committee as executives, including the\ndetermination of participants and grant sizes,\nallocation of the pool from which a grant\nwould be made, establishment and documentation\nof the terms and conditions of such grants,\napproval of amendments to outstanding grants\n(subject to any limitations set forth in the\napplicable plan or the Committee's delegation\nof authority) and exercise of any\ndiscretionary authority provided to PNC or the\nCommittee pursuant to the terms of the\noutstanding grants and the applicable plan.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Risk Committee (or\nin the case of equity-based grants, a\nqualified subcommittee of the Risk Committee)\nhave the authority to award compensation under\napplicable plans to our General Auditor and\nour Chief Risk Officer, respectively.\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s role in compensation           \n  decisions                                   \n                                              \n. Our executive officers, including the CEO\nand the Chief Human Resources Officer, often\nreview compensation information with the Human\nResources Committee during Committee meetings\nand may present management\u2019s views or\nrecommendations. The Committee evaluates these\nrecommendations, generally in consultation\nwith an independent compensation consultant\nretained by the Committee who attends each\nmeeting.\n\nThe chair of the Human Resources Committee\ntypically meets with management and an\nindependent compensation consultant before\neach meeting of the Committee to discuss\nagenda topics, areas of focus or outstanding\nissues. The chair of the Committee schedules\nother meetings with the Committee\u2019s\nindependent compensation consultant without\nmanagement present as needed. Occasionally,\nmanagement will schedule meetings with the\nchair of the Committee or other Committee\nmembers to discuss substantive issues. For\nmore complicated issues, these one-on-one\nmeetings provide a dedicated forum for\nCommittee members to ask questions outside of\nthe meeting environment.\n\nDuring Human Resources Committee meetings, the\nCEO often reviews corporate and individual\nperformance as part of the compensation\ndiscussions, and other members of executive\nmanagement may be invited to speak to the\nCommittee about specific elements of\nperformance or risk management. Our Chief Risk\nOfficer regularly presents to the Committee\nregarding risk management, including its\nimpact on the Committee\u2019s discussions and\ndecisions regarding executive compensation.\nThe Committee reviews compensation decisions\nfor the Chief Human Resources Officer and the\nCEO in executive session, without either\nofficer present for the discussion of their\ncompensation. Any decisions on CEO\ncompensation are also discussed with the full\nBoard in executive session.\n                                              \n  Role of compensation consultants            \n                                              \n. The Human Resources Committee has the sole\nauthority to retain and terminate any\ncompensation consultant directly assisting it.\nThe Committee also has the sole authority to\napprove fees and other engagement terms. The\nCommittee receives comparative compensation\ndata from management, from proxy statements\nand other public disclosures, and through\nsurveys and reports prepared by compensation\nconsultants.\n\nThe Human Resources Committee retained\nMeridian Compensation Partners, LLC\n(\"Meridian\") as its independent compensation\nconsultant for 2021.

Meridian also reviewed\nmeeting agendas and materials prepared by\nmanagement.\n\nMeridian and members of management assisted\nthe Human Resources Committee in its review of\nproposed compensation packages for our\nexecutive officers. For the 2021 performance\nyear, Meridian prepared discussion materials\nfor the compensation of the CEO, which were\nreviewed by the Committee in executive\nsession. Meridian also prepared other\nbenchmarking reviews and pay for performance\nanalyses for the Committee. PNC paid no fees\nto Meridian in 2021 other than fees paid in\nconnection with work performed by Meridian for\nthe Committee.\n\nThe Human Resources Committee evaluated\nwhether the work of Meridian raised any\nconflicts of interest. The Committee\nconsidered various factors, including the six\nfactors mandated by SEC rules, and determined\nthat no conflict of interest was raised by the\nwork performed by Meridian for the Committee.\n\nManagement retains other compensation\nconsultants for its own use. In 2021,\nmanagement retained McLagan to provide certain\nmarket data in the financial services\nindustry.

The Board most recently approved\nthe charter of the Risk Committee on November\n10, 2021, and it is available on our website\nat www.pnc.com/corporategovernance. The Risk\nCommittee\u2019s purpose is to require and oversee\nthe establishment and implementation of our\nenterprise-wide risk governance framework,\nincluding related policies, procedures,\nactivities and processes to identify, assess,\nmonitor and manage material risks at PNC\n(except for accounting and financial reporting\nrisk exposures and related reputational risks,\nwhich are the responsibility of the Audit\nCommittee). The Risk Committee\u2019s\nresponsibility is one of oversight, and the\nCommittee has no duty to assure compliance\nwith laws and regulations. The Risk Committee\nserves as the primary point of contact between\nthe Board and the management-level committees\ndealing with risk management. The Committee\nreceives regular reports on enterprise risk\nmanagement and capital and liquidity\nmanagement, as well as credit, market,\noperational, line of business, model,\nenvironmental and social (including climate-\nrelated), and reputational risks. At each\nquarterly meeting of the full Board, the chair\nof the Risk Committee presents a report of the\nitems discussed and actions approved at\nprevious meetings of the Committee. The Risk\nCommittee also appoints our Chief Risk\nOfficer, who leads our risk management\nfunction. The Committee reviews the\nperformance and approves the compensation of\nthe Chief Risk Officer, except with respect to\nhis equity-based grants, which are approved by\na qualified subcommittee of the Risk\nCommittee. The Committee reviews the Chief\nRisk Officer's succession plan with the CEO\nannually and with the Board from time to time.\nThe Risk Committee, along with the Human\nResources Committee, reviews the risk\ncomponents of our incentive compensation\nplans. For a discussion of the relationship\nbetween compensation and risk, see\nCompensation and Risk beginning on page 63.\nSubcommittees .

The\nabsence of one of the enumerated relationships\nunder this \u201cbright-line\u201d test does not mean\nthat a director is deemed independent.

If a relationship\ninvolving a director meets the criteria\noutlined in the guidelines, the Board may\naffirm the director\u2019s independence without\nfurther analysis of that relationship,\nprovided that the director otherwise meets the\nrelevant independence tests. These guidelines\nare included in our corporate governance\nguidelines, which can be found on our website\nat www.pnc.com/corporategovernance.\n\nThe four categories of relationships described\nin the director independence guidelines\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Ordinary course business relationships, such\nas lending, deposit, banking or other\nfinancial service relationships, or other\nrelationships involving the provision of\nproducts or services by or to PNC or its\nsubsidiaries and involving a director, an\nimmediate family member, or an affiliated\nentity of a director or immediate family\nmember, where such relationships satisfy the\ncriteria described in the guidelines\n\n\u2022 Contributions made by PNC, its subsidiaries\nor a PNC-sponsored foundation to a charitable\norganization of which a director or an\nimmediate family member is an executive\nofficer, director or trustee, subject to the\nconditions described in the guidelines\n\n\u2022 Relationships involving a director\u2019s\nrelative who is not an immediate family member\n\n\u2022 Relationships or transactions between PNC or\nits subsidiaries and a company or charitable\norganization where a director or an immediate\nfamily member serves solely as a non-\nmanagement board member or trustee or where an\nimmediate family member is employed in a non-\nofficer position\n                                              \n  30    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nThe director independence guidelines also\nallow investors to understand the\nconsiderations underlying the Board\u2019s\nindependence determinations.\n\nIn applying these guidelines, an \u201cimmediate\nfamily member\u201d includes a person\u2019s spouse,\nparents, children, siblings, mothers- and\nfathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law,\nbrothers- and sisters-in-law, and anyone\n(other than domestic employees) who shares\nsuch person\u2019s home.\n\nIf a director has a relationship that would\nnot be considered material under our director\nindependence guidelines but is one of the\nrelationships described in the NYSE\u2019s bright-\nline independence tests, the NYSE rules govern\nand the director will not qualify as\nindependent.\n                                              \n  The Board\u2019s independence determinations     \n                                              \n. At a meeting held on February 10, 2022, the\nBoard made an independence determination for\neach of our directors, including our director\nnominees. In making these determinations, the\nBoard relied on the evaluation and\nrecommendations made by the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee. The Board considered\nrelevant facts and circumstances, including an\nevaluation of the relationships described in\nthis proxy statement.\n\nIn some cases, the relationships the Board\nevaluated included relationships a director\nhas as a partner, member, shareholder, officer\nor employee of an organization that has a\nrelationship with PNC. The relationships\nevaluated may have also included relationships\nwhere an immediate family member of a director\nis a partner, member, shareholder or officer\nof an organization that has a relationship\nwith PNC.\n\nThe Board based its independence decisions on\ninformation known as of February 10, 2022.\nEach director has been asked to provide\nupdates regarding any changes in circumstances\nthat could impact the director\u2019s status as an\nindependent director. The Nominating and\nGovernance Committee and the Board will\nconsider information received throughout the\nyear that may impact director independence.\n\nNon-independent directors . The Board\ndetermined that Mr. Demchak is a non-\nindependent director under the NYSE\u2019s bright-\nline independence tests because he is an\nexecutive officer of PNC.\n\nIndependent directors .

An employee or an immediate family member\nmay want to engage in a business arrangement,\nsuch as the sale or lease of property or the\nprovision of services, with PNC.

We prohibit directors and employees from\ntransacting business on behalf of PNC with a\nsupplier or customer in which the director,\nemployee or an extended family member has a\nsignificant personal or financial interest. We\nalso prohibit directors and employees from\ntransacting business on behalf of PNC with\nrespect to their own accounts, extended family\nmember accounts or accounts for anyone whose\nclose relationship may reasonably be viewed as\ncreating a conflict of interest.

For credit extensions under a\nbenefit or compensatory program widely\navailable to all employees, we may not give\npreference to any covered individual\n\n\u2022 The covered extension of credit be made\nfollowing credit underwriting procedures no\nless stringent than those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable transactions with non-\ncovered individuals or entities. The extension\nof credit may not involve more than the normal\nrisk of repayment or present other unfavorable\nfeatures\n\n\u2022 The amount of covered extensions of credit\ndo not exceed individual and aggregate lending\nlimits, depending on the identity of the\nborrower and the nature of the loan\n\nOur subsidiary bank, PNC Bank, National\nAssociation, has a Regulation O Credit Officer\nwho reviews extensions of credit to determine\nour compliance with these policies. If an\nextension of credit would result in an\naggregate credit extension of more than\n$500,000, the bank\u2019s Board of Directors must\napprove it.

Mr. Demchak\nreceives no additional compensation for\nserving as a PNC director. In addition to\nannual compensation, the Committee may approve\nspecial compensation to a director for\nextraordinary service. The primary objectives\nof the Committee\u2019s annual review are to\nconfirm continued alignment with business and\nshareholder interests, evaluate our director\ncompensation program relative to our peers,\nand identify and respond to continued changes\nin director compensation in light of the\ncompetitive environment.

Under this plan,\nthe directors may elect to defer compensation\ninto an account that tracks the price of PNC\ncommon stock or an interest rate defined in\nthe plan. The accounts that track the price of\nPNC common stock are credited with a number of\nunits (including fractional shares) that could\nhave been purchased with the equivalent of PNC\ncommon stock cash dividends. We do not pay\nabove-market or preferential earnings on any\ndirector compensation that is deferred. The\ndirectors may choose the payout date and\nwhether the payout, which is made in cash,\nwill be in a lump sum or up to 10 annual\ninstallment payments.\n\nUnder the Outside Directors Deferred Stock\nUnit Program, a subprogram of the 2016\nIncentive Award Plan, each non-employee\ndirector is eligible to receive an annual\ngrant of deferred stock units that vest\nimmediately upon grant and are paid out in\nshares of PNC common stock at retirement. The\ndeferred stock units accrue dividends with\nreinvestment equal to the number of units that\ncould have been purchased with the equivalent\nof PNC common stock cash dividends (rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share).\n                                              \n  Other director benefits.                    \n                                              \nWe generally limit the benefits we provide to\nour directors, but we regularly provide the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Charitable matching gifts . We will match a\nnon-employee director\u2019s personal gifts to\nqualifying charities up to a limit of $5,000\nper year.\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies . We pay for various\ninsurance policies that protect directors and\ntheir families from personal loss connected\nwith Board service.\n\n\u2022 Expenses related to Board service . We pay\nfor expenses connected with our directors\u2019\nBoard service, including travel on corporate,\nprivate or commercial aircraft, lodging, meals\nand incidentals.\n\nWe may also provide other incidental benefits\nto our directors from time to time, including\ntickets to cultural, social, sporting or other\nevents and small gifts for holidays, birthdays\nor special occasions. In limited\ncircumstances, we may also provide travel for\ndirectors on corporate aircraft for personal\npurposes, such as when a family emergency\narises or a seat is available on a previously\nscheduled flight. We determine the value of\nthese benefits based on the incremental cost\nto PNC and we include the amount in the \u201cAll\nOther Compensation\u201d column of the Director\ncompensation in 2021 table below.\n                                              \n  Director stock ownership requirement.       \n                                              \nThe Board has adopted a common stock purchase\nguideline for our non-management directors.\nUnder this guideline, each director must own\nshares of PNC common stock (including phantom\nstock units) with a value of at least five\ntimes the value of his or her annual base\nretainer. Until a director meets this\nownership level, he or she must purchase or\nacquire common stock or stock units that equal\nat least 25% of the annual retainer for that\nyear. A director may satisfy this requirement\nthrough open market purchases or by deferring\ncompensation into stock units under the\nDirectors Deferred Compensation Plan described\nabove.

The Human Resources\nCommittee (referred to in this CD&A as the\n\"Committee\") uses the following principles to\nhelp guide its executive compensation\ndecisions:\n                                              \n  COMPEN\u2026                                     \n  PRINCI\u2026                                     \n                         Manage     Discour\u2026  \n  Pay for    Create      talent     excessi\u2026  \n  perfor\u2026    value       Provide    risk-ta\u2026  \n  Provide    Align       compet\u2026    Encoura\u2026  \n  approp\u2026    executi\u2026    compen\u2026    focus on  \n  compen\u2026    compens\u2026    opport\u2026    the       \n  for        with        to         long-te\u2026  \n  demons\u2026    long-te\u2026    attrac\u2026    success   \n  perfor\u2026    shareho\u2026    retain     of PNC    \n  across     value       and        and       \n  the        creation    motiva\u2026    discour\u2026  \n  enterp\u2026                high-q\u2026    excessi\u2026  \n                         execut\u2026    risk-ta\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the successful\napplication of these principles requires a\nthoughtful program design, which includes a\nbalanced evaluation of performance. The\nCommittee believes that discretion,\nflexibility and judgment are critical to its\nability to award incentive compensation that\nreflects near-term performance results and\nprogress toward longer-term strategic\npriorities that allow PNC to create value for\nour shareholders. See Evaluating performance\nto determine incentive compensation on page 46\nfor more information on how the Committee\nevaluates performance.\n                                              \n  Key program features                        \n                                              \nThe Committee reviews and approves the\ncompensation to be paid to our NEOs. We seek\nclarity and transparency in our compensation\nstructure, using features that we believe will\nhelp to create a balanced program. While we\nconsider the expectations of various\nstakeholders, we want our compensation program\nto achieve multiple objectives, consistent\nwith our compensation principles. The\nCommittee also regularly reviews the operation\nof our compensation program to help ensure\nthat our objectives continue to be met.\n\nTaken as a whole, our executive compensation\nprogram includes several complementary\nfeatures:\n                                              \n  We provide incentives for performance over  \n  different time horizons (short- and         \n  long-term).                                 \n  We embed performance goals into a           \n  significant                                 \n  portion of our long-term incentives \u2014 and   \n  include                                     \n  a risk-based performance review that could  \n  reduce                                      \n  or eliminate the awards.                    \n  We reward achievement against both          \n  quantitative                                \n  and qualitative goals, while allowing for   \n  discretion.                                 \n  We connect pay to company performance,      \n  relative to                                 \n  both our internal objectives and controls   \n  and the                                     \n  performance of a carefully

        \n  We place a substantial majority of          \n  compensation at                             \n  risk.                                       \n  We pay some incentive compensation in cash

The        \n  Committee                                   \n  evaluates many factors, including the       \n  appropriateness of the job match and        \n  market data,                                \n  the responsibilities of the position and    \n  the                                         \n  executive\u2019s demonstrated performance,       \n  skills and                                  \n  experience.                                 \n  At least 50% of compensation is             \n  equity-based and                            \n  not payable for several years.The           \n  Committee                                   \n  believes that a significant portion of      \n  compensation should be at risk, tied to     \n  PNC stock                                   \n  performance and not payable, if at all,     \n  for                                         \n  several years. Accordingly, at the          \n  beginning of                                \n  the performance year, the Committee         \n  establishes a                               \n  specific minimum percentage of each         \n  executive's                                 \n  total compensation that will be delivered   \n  through                                     \n  long-term equity-based awards.

For\ninformation on how the 2021 incentive\ncompensation decisions by the Committee\ncompared to the incentive compensation\ntargets, see page 53.\n\nThe Committee believes that an effective\nexecutive compensation program requires a\ncomprehensive evaluation of performance across\nmultiple categories. This evaluation generally\nincludes a review of financial performance,\nhow we executed against our strategic\nobjectives and how we manage risk, customer\nexperience and leadership.\n\nThe Committee has not adopted a formula-driven\ncompensation program, believing that formulas\nmay reward short-term results or behaviors\nthat do not serve the long-term interests of\nour shareholders. Metrics that rely on\nformulas may also be inappropriately skewed by\nresults outside of management's control.\nFinally, formulas may undervalue important\nstrategic objectives that do not translate to\neasily or immediately quantifiable metrics.\n\nTo the extent possible, the performance\nmetrics reviewed by the Committee align the\nobjectives of our management, shareholders and\nfederal banking regulators. In some cases,\nthese stakeholders have different objectives\nthat cannot be easily reconciled \u2014 for\nexample, shareholders seeking higher returns\nmay be willing to tolerate more risk than a\nfederal banking regulator would accept. That\nis one reason we use multiple metrics,\nrepresenting achievement against a range of\ngoals, as well as significant adjustments for\nrisk management. The Committee does not\nnecessarily favor one metric over another.\nInstead, the Committee uses these metrics to\nattain a comprehensive understanding of our\noverall performance.\n\nThe CEO reviews PNC's quarterly and annual\nperformance with the Committee.

These awards, and all\nother equity-based awards, are made under\nPNC\u2019s shareholder-approved 2016 Incentive\nAward Plan.\n\nThe table below summarizes the material terms\nand conditions of the awards granted in 2022\nfor 2021 performance (these terms and\nconditions are the same as the terms and\nconditions of the awards granted in 2021 for\n2020 performance):\n                                              \n         % of                    Pay\u2026    St\u2026  \n  Na\u2026    Lon\u2026    Ves\u2026            Ran\u2026    or   \n  of     Inc\u2026    Sch\u2026    Met\u2026    (%      Ca\u2026  \n  Aw\u2026    Val\u2026                    of      Pa\u2026  \n                                 Tar\u2026         \n                         PNC\u2026                 \n                         ret\u2026                 \n                 Aft\u2026    on                   \n                 3-y\u2026    equ\u2026                 \n  PSU    60%     per\u2026    (RO\u2026    0\u20131\u2026    St\u2026  \n                 per\u2026    com\u2026                 \n                 ends    to                   \n                         per\u2026                 \n                         tar\u2026                 \n  EPS                                         \n  gr\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  ag\u2026                                         \n  our                                         \n  pe\u2026                                         \n  gr\u2026                                         \n                 Ann\u2026                         \n                 ins\u2026                         \n  RSU    40%     over    Tim\u2026    0\u20131\u2026    St\u2026  \n                 3                            \n                 yea\u2026                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  PSUs.                                       \n                                              \nWith respect to 2021 performance, in the first\nquarter of 2022 the Committee granted to\ncertain of our senior executives, including\nall NEOs, PSUs that represent an opportunity\nto receive shares of PNC common stock. The\npayout is based on how PNC performs against\ntwo corporate performance metrics over a\nthree-year performance period. Performance\nagainst these two metrics generates a\npercentage (the corporate performance factor).\nThe award may be decreased if PNC fails to\nsatisfy a risk performance metric or based on\na discretionary risk performance review\nconducted by the Committee. After applying any\nrisk-related performance adjustment (and if\nPNC satisfies the risk performance metric),\nthe resulting percentage is applied to the\nnumber of target PSUs to determine the final\nnumber of units available for settlement. The\nPSUs have a maximum payout opportunity of 150%\nof target. Payout of any award under the PSUs\nalso requires the satisfaction of service\nrequirements and other award conditions.\n\nThe Committee may also increase or decrease\nthe size of the final payout to maintain the\nintended economics of the award if\ncircumstances change. These circumstances\ninclude external events affecting PNC or\nmembers of its peer group or its financial\nstatements that are outside of PNC's control\nand not reasonably anticipated.\n\nThe two corporate performance metrics include\nan absolute metric (an internal PNC\nmeasurement against a target) and a relative\nmetric (PNC performance against our peer\ngroup). The absolute metric is PNC's three-\nyear average return on equity (\"ROE\"), as\nadjusted, compared to three-year ROE\nperformance targets established in advance by\nthe Committee. The relative metric is PNC's\nthree-year average EPS growth, as adjusted,\ncompared to the three-year average EPS growth\nof our peer group.\n\nThe ROE metric will be calculated annually for\neach year of the performance period. At the\nend of the three-year performance period,\naverage ROE for the performance period will be\ndetermined as the average of PNC's annual ROE\nfor each year. In establishing the ROE\nperformance targets, the Committee considers\nmultiple factors, including our historical\nperformance, budget and future growth\nexpectations, peer group results, cost of\ncapital and analyst expectations.\n\nThe EPS growth metric will be calculated for\neach year of the performance period. At the\nend of the three-year performance period, the\nannual EPS growth percentages will be\naveraged. PNC's three-year average EPS growth\nwill be compared to the three-year average of\neach member of our peer group to determine our\npercentile rank.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2022                             45  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nOnce PNC's percentile rank relating to average\nEPS growth and PNC's average ROE are\ndetermined for purposes of the grants, the\ncorporate performance factor, ranging from\n0\u2013150%, will be calculated using the grid\nbelow and applying bilinear interpolation.\n\nThe chart below shows the corporate\nperformance metrics for the 2022 PSU grants\n(the corporate performance metrics for the\n2021 grants were disclosed in our 2021 proxy\nstatement).

Net charge-\noffs represent the amount of a loan (or\nportion of a loan) that we remove from our\nbalance sheet because we deem it to be\nuncollectible, less any recoveries. We expect\nthis adjusted ROE and EPS growth to present a\nmore accurate measurement of how efficiently\nwe create profit, as it replaces our estimated\ncredit losses (provision) with the actual\nlosses we incur (net charge-offs). Adjustments\nwill also be made on an after-tax basis for\nthe net impact to PNC related to the sale of\nits equity investment in BlackRock, and the\nimpact to PNC and the companies in our peer\ngroup, as appropriate, of items resulting from\nchanges in federal tax law, discontinued\noperations (as such term is used under GAAP),\nand acquisition costs and merger integration\ncosts.\n                                              \n  RSUs.                                       \n                                              \nWith respect to 2021 performance, in early\n2022 the Committee also granted to certain of\nour senior executives, including all NEOs,\nRSUs that represent an opportunity to receive\nshares of PNC common stock. The RSUs vest pro\nrata over three years, with each of the three\nannual installments (tranches) vesting on the\nanniversary of the grant date. Vesting also\nrequires the satisfaction of service\nrequirements and other award conditions.\n                                              \n  Additional provisions for PSUs and RSUs.    \n                                              \nThe provisions described in this section apply\nto both of our long-term incentive awards \u2014\nthe PSUs and the RSUs.\n\nRisk-based performance reviews. All long-term\nincentive awards are subject to risk-based\nperformance reviews. The risk-based\nperformance metric measures whether PNC has a\nBasel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio\nof at least 7.0% based on current definitions\nand requirements (the \"CET1 Ratio\"). The CET1\nRatio is measured as of the end of the\nperformance year.\n\nFor PSUs, for each year during the three-year\nperformance period that PNC fails to meet the\nCET1 Ratio, one-third of the target number of\nPSUs granted will be eligible for forfeiture.\nAfter the three-year performance period ends,\nthe Committee will conduct a final performance\nreview and may reduce the number of target\nshares available for payout if PNC did not\nmeet the CET1 Ratio for one or more years\nduring the performance period.\n\nFor RSUs, each RSU tranche is subject to the\nsame risk-related performance metric that will\nbe applied to the PSUs, with all or a portion\nof that tranche being eligible for forfeiture.\nAfter the year ends, the Committee will\nconduct a risk-based performance review and\nmay decrease the number of shares available\nfor payout under the applicable RSU tranche if\nPNC did not meet the CET1 Ratio as of the end\nof the most recent year before the vesting\ndate of that tranche.\n\nIn addition, and independent from the\nevaluation of the CET1 Ratio, the Committee\nmay conduct another risk performance review\nfor the PSUs and the RSUs. This discretionary\nreview would generally occur in connection\nwith a risk-related action of potentially\nmaterial consequence to PNC. If the Committee\nexercises its discretion to conduct a risk\nperformance review, the Committee will review\nand determine if a reduction to the corporate\nperformance factor for risk performance is\nappropriate for the PSUs or if a reduction for\nrisk performance is appropriate for the\napplicable RSU tranche.\n\nDividends. Both the PSUs and the RSUs will\naccrue cash dividend equivalents during their\nrespective performance periods. For the PSUs,\nthe accrued dividend equivalents will be\nadjusted by the same percentage as the target\nPSUs at the time of payout and will then be\npaid out in cash. For the RSUs, the accrued\ndividend equivalents with respect to a\n                                              \n  46    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \ntranche will pay out in cash at the same time,\nand will be adjusted by the same payout\npercentage, as the RSUs to which they relate.\n                                              \n  Other compensation and benefits             \n                                              \nIn addition to the components included in the\ntotal compensation target outlined above, our\nexecutive compensation program also includes\nthe following components:\n                                              \n                         \u2022Provided, in        \n                         limited              \n                         circumstances, to    \n                         increase efficiency  \n  Perquisites            and focus on our     \n                         business.            \n                         \u2022Described in more   \n                         detail beginning on  \n                         page 60.             \n                         \u2022Provided for        \n                         continuity of        \n  Change\u00a0in\u00a0Control\u00a0     management in        \n  Arrangements           connection with a    \n                         change in control.   \n                         \u2022Described in more   \n                         detail on page 76    \n                         \u2022Provided to         \n  Health and             promote health and   \n  Retirement Plans       wellness and         \n                         post-retirement      \n                         financial security.  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Glossary of key performance metrics         \n                                              \nThe following chart defines some of the key\nperformance metrics evaluated by the Committee\nand explains why we use each metric.

When establishing the\ntotal compensation targets for 2021, the\nCommittee reviewed available market data with\nMeridian, its independent compensation\nconsultant, and members of management. The\ntotal compensation targets for the 2021\ncompensation year remained unchanged from the\nprior year's targets.\n                                              \n  2021 performance                            \n                                              \nAt meetings held during the first quarter of\n2022, the Committee reviewed PNC's 2021\nperformance with the CEO, the Chief Risk\nOfficer and other members of management. In\nevaluating our 2021 performance, the Committee\nreviewed our performance against the range of\nmetrics described on page 49, including the\nselected performance metrics identified in the\ntable below. As noted above, the Committee\nreviews our results on the six core financial\nperformance metrics in the table below\nrelative to both budget and the prior year's\nresults, along with other key metrics that are\ngenerally evaluated relative to the prior\nyear's results.\n                                              \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                       \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                       \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n      \u2026  %    \u2026  %    \u2026  %                    \n      \u2026  %    \u2026  %    \u2026  %                    \n      \u2026  %    \u2026  %    \u2026  %        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026                       \n      \u2026               \u2026                       \n         \u2026               \u2026                    \n         \u2026               \u2026                    \n      \u2026  %            \u2026  %                    \n      \u2026  %            \u2026  %                    \n                                              \n* Non-GAAP financial measure. See Annex A for\na reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP, and for additional\ninformation about the adjustments to GAAP\nmeasures.\n\n(1) Some of the results include certain\nadjustments to PNC's performance. Based on\nthese adjustments, the results in the table\nmay differ from reported results under GAAP.\nFor 2021 and 2020, diluted EPS, ROE, ROA and\nrisk-adjusted efficiency ratio have been\nadjusted to reflect the integration costs\nrelated to the BBVA USA acquisition, which\nclosed in the second quarter of 2021. For\n2020, diluted EPS, ROE, ROA and risk-adjusted\nefficiency ratio have also been adjusted to\nreflect the impact of the divestiture of our\nentire 22.4% equity investment in BlackRock,\nwhich occurred in the second quarter of 2020.\nAs a result of the adjustment for the\nBlackRock divestiture, these metrics do not\ninclude the after-tax gain of $4.3 billion or\nBlackRock's historical results. As discussed\nin more detail on page 48, we adjusted PNC's\n2021 and 2020 results to add back our\nprovision for credit losses and subtract our\nnet charge-offs. When reviewing PNC's\nperformance against peer group performance, we\nadjust peer performance for the same types of\nitems for which we could adjust PNC\nperformance. In both 2020 and 2021, we\nadjusted peer results, as applicable, for the\nimpact of various merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and income (or loss)\nfrom discontinued operations.\n                                              \n  48    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \n(2) As a smaller efficiency ratio is better\nthan a larger one, we have presented the\ndecrease in the risk-adjusted efficiency ratio\nas a positive change when compared to our\nbudget, and the increase in the risk-adjusted\nefficiency ratio as a negative change when\ncompared to the prior year's results.\n\nThe Committee considered PNC's overall\nperformance across these and other metrics,\nincluding how PNC's management continued to\nnavigate the second year of the global\npandemic and the ongoing volatility throughout\nthe economy, particularly regarding the\nretention of talent. In making compensation\ndecisions for the 2021 performance year, the\nCommittee focused on the following\nachievements:\n                                              \n  The successful closing and

of a\nglobal pandemic, the challenges in hiring and\nretaining talent and the increasing demand for\ntechnological innovation and data security,\nPNC generally outperformed its 2021 budget and\nperformed well against its peer group.\n\nAgainst the 2021 budget, PNC exceeded\nexpectations for diluted EPS, noninterest\nincome, ROA, ROE and risk-adjusted efficiency\nratio, while slightly underperforming against\nthe budget for net interest income.\n\nThe Committee considered PNC's consistent\nability to deliver strong long-term value to\nshareholders, with a 3-year and 5-year TSR\nremaining above the 75th percentile of our\npeer group and a one-year TSR of 38.2% being\nslightly below the median of our peer group.\nThe Committee compared other key financial\nmetrics to our peer group, noting that PNC was\n1st in the peer group for net interest income\nand 2nd in noninterest income, primarily\ndriven by the impact of the BBVA USA\nacquisition. In considering other key\nfinancial metrics relative to our peer group\nfor which PNC was below the peer group median,\nincluding EPS growth, ROA, ROE and risk-\nadjusted efficiency ratio, the Committee\nrecognized that two significant actions taken\nby management over the past two years \u2014 the\n2020 sale of our equity investment in\nBlackRock and the acquisition of BBVA USA in\n2021 \u2014 introduced short-term volatility into\nthese key metrics while representing the\nsuccessful execution of longer-term strategic\ndecisions. The sale of our equity investment\nin BlackRock eliminated BlackRock's income\nfrom our operations and resulted in an\ninfusion of excess capital that remained until\nit was redeployed with the closing of the BBVA\nUSA acquisition. Until we closed the BBVA USA\nacquisition, we also suspended our common\nshare repurchase programs. These short-term\nimpacts affected our financial metrics\nrelative to our peer group in various ways \u2014\ncarrying the excess capital from the BlackRock\nsale in May 2020 until the closing of the BBVA\nUSA acquisition in June 2021 lowered our\nreturns on a relative basis.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        49  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nIn addition to a review of key financial\nmetrics, the Committee also reviewed PNC's\nperformance against the three Board-reviewed\nstrategic priorities listed below. The\nCommittee concluded that management continued\nto drive growth across the franchise and make\nstrategic investments to position PNC for\nlong-term success, including the

The CEO\ndiscussed the individual performance of the\nother NEOs with the Committee and, where\nappropriate, discussed the performance of the\nlines of business or functions managed by the\nNEOs. The Committee approved compensation for\neach NEO based on an evaluation of corporate,\nbusiness and individual performance. The\nCommittee discussed compensation\nrecommendations for the CEO with Meridian, the\nCommittee's independent compensation\nconsultant for 2021, our Chief Human Resources\nOfficer, our Head of Total Rewards and legal\ncounsel. No other members of management were\npresent. Following this discussion, the\nCommittee approved the compensation for our\nCEO in an executive session.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the CEO\ncompensation decisions in an executive session\nof the independent members of the Board, with\nno members of management present. In that\nexecutive session, the Committee allowed time\nfor the independent directors to provide\ncomments or questions about the CEO's\nperformance or compensation.\n                                              \n  50    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \n                                              \n  2021 compensation decisions                 \n                                              \nBased on a comprehensive evaluation of PNC's\n2021 performance, the Committee determined\nthat it was appropriate to award incentive\ncompensation that was above the target amount\nfor each NEO. The Committee focused in\nparticular on the successful acquisition and\nintegration of BBVA USA, which occurred less\nthan a year after the announcement of the\ntransaction, as well as management's ability\nto deliver consistent results for\nshareholders, as evidenced by our TSR \u2014 on\nboth an absolute basis and when measured\nagainst the peer group.\n\nThe Committee also considered the solid\nfinancial results that PNC achieved in 2021\nwith record revenue and record fee income, the\nachievement of the continuous improvement\nprogram savings goal and continued improvement\nin the credit portfolio. The Committee noted\nthe significant support for PNC's communities,\nincluding the announcement of the $88 billion\nplan to expand economic opportunities for\nminorities and low-and moderate-income\nindividuals and communities. Finally, the\nCommittee considered management's successful\nexecution against key strategic priorities,\nincluding achievement of our goal to establish\na presence in all of the top 30 U.S. markets,\nthe launch of the Low Cash Mode\u00ae offering to\nhelp customers avoid overdraft fees and\nmeeting all six of our organizational\nworkforce diversity objectives in 2021.\n\nIn recognition of his leadership of the firm\nthroughout 2021 in driving the strong\nperformance and significant strategic\naccomplishments outlined above, the Committee\nawarded Mr. Demchak incentive compensation of\napproximately 45% above target. For each NEO\nother than the CEO, the Committee awarded\nincentive compensation ranging from\napproximately 17% to 42% above target. In the\nCommittee's opinion, the range of incentive\ncompensation awards for the NEOs reflected the\nstrong performance by each NEO, and also\nincorporated the relative performance of the\nbusinesses and functions managed by each NEO.\nAs CEO, Mr. Demchak received 75% of this total\ncompensation for 2021 in the form of long-term\nequity-based incentive awards. Each of the\nother NEOs received at least 50% of his or her\ntotal compensation for 2021 in the form of\nlong-term equity-based incentive awards.\n\nThe table below shows, for each NEO, the\nincentive compensation target for 2021 and the\nactual annual cash incentive and long-term\nequity-based incentives awarded for 2021\nperformance. The incentive compensation\nawarded for 2021 performance differs from what\nwe disclose in the Summary compensation table\non page 65. In compliance with SEC rules, the\n2021 incentive compensation disclosed in the\nSummary compensation table includes incentive\nawards from two different performance years \u2014\nthe long-term equity-based incentive granted\nin 2021 (for 2020 performance) and the annual\ncash incentive paid in 2022 (for 2021\nperformance).\n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                  \u2026           \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Under SEC regulations, the incentive\ncompensation amounts disclosed in the Summary\ncompensation table on page 65 include the\nannual cash incentive award paid in 2022 for\n2021 performance (the \"Non-Equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation\" column) and the long-term\nequity-based incentive award granted in 2021\nfor 2020 performance (the \"Stock Awards\"\ncolumn). The amounts shown in the \"Stock\nAwards\" column of the Summary compensation\ntable differ slightly from the amounts shown\nin the table above due to the impact of\nrounding related to fractional shares.\n\nAs described on pages 47 to 49, the long-term\nincentive portion of the incentive\ncompensation granted by the Committee in 2022\nconsisted of two grants, the PSUs and the\nRSUs.\n\nThe charts below show the base salary for 2021\nfor each executive, and the annual cash and\nlong-term equity-based incentives awarded in\n2022 for 2021 performance.

In addition, the Committee may\nreduce or increase the payout under the award\nto maintain the intended economics of the\naward in light of changed circumstances \u2014\nmeaning external events affecting PNC, its\nfinancial statements or members of its peer\ngroup that are substantially outside of PNC's\ncontrol and could not reasonably be planned\nfor as of the grant date.\n\nWhen considering the payout for the 2019 PSU\nawards, the Committee noted PNC's strong\nperformance and management's success in\ncreating long-term shareholder value over the\nthree-year PSU performance period. The\nCommittee highlighted PNC's outstanding TSR,\nwhich was in the top quartile of our peer\ngroup for both the three-year and five-year\nperiods. The Committee took into consideration\nhow the achievement of two significant\naccomplishments \u2014 the sale of PNC\u2019s equity\ninvestment in BlackRock in 2020 followed by\nthe acquisition of BBVA USA in 2021 \u2014 greatly\ncontributed to PNC\u2019s excellent performance and\nvalue creation\n\nThe strategic sale of PNC's 22.4% equity\ninvestment in BlackRock in May 2020 resulted\nin sizable net proceeds to PNC of $14.2\nbillion and an after-tax gain of $4.3 billion.\nThe acquisition of BBVA USA, which we\nannounced in November 2020 and closed in 2021,\nsuccessfully redeployed the excess BlackRock\ncapital. From a strategic and operational\nperspective, the Committee recognized that\nselling our outstanding equity investment in\nBlackRock and then closing and converting an\ninstitution the size of BBVA USA in 11 months\n\u2014 while continuing to navigate a global\npandemic and retaining key executive talent \u2014\nrepresented a remarkable accomplishment.\n\nThe Committee also discussed how the financial\naccounting for these transactions impacted the\ntwo key metrics (average ROE and average EPS\ngrowth) over the PSU performance period. The\nBlackRock sale created a significant amount of\nsurplus capital that could not be immediately\nredeployed, while also removing the benefit of\nBlackRock's income from our future financial\nstatements. Applying GAAP, the excess capital\nand elimination of BlackRock recurring income\nreduced our average ROE and average EPS growth\nin both 2020 and 2021. The Committee concluded\nthat the long-term strategic benefits from the\nBlackRock equity sale and successful and rapid\nacquisition and conversion of BBVA USA\noutweighed any expected and transitory GAAP\nimpact on ROE and EPS growth.\n\nTaking into account both the successful\nachievement of important strategic objectives\nand the accounting impact of achieving those\nobjectives, the Committee evaluated the PSU\nmetrics over the three-year period by removing\nthe financial impact of our BlackRock\ninvestment (which was treated under GAAP as\ndiscontinued operations for that period). By\neliminating the impact of our BlackRock equity\ninvestment for the entire performance period\nof the 2019 PSU award, the corporate\nperformance factor for the 2019 award resulted\nin a 118.95% payout. These adjustments\neliminated the net book value of the BlackRock\nequity investment and any income derived from\nthe investment over those years, and also\neliminated the large gain on the sale of the\nequity. Without these BlackRock-related\nadjustments, the corporate performance factor\nwould have resulted in a 64.59% payout.\n\nThe Committee considered PNC's overall\nperformance over the three-year period, the\nbenefits of divesting our passive BlackRock\ninvestment and strategically and quickly\nredeploying the capital by acquiring BBVA USA.\nBased on this, the Committee approved an\nadjusted payout for the 2019 PSU award of\n118.95%. This payout amount removed the one-\ntime financial impact of the BlackRock equity\nsale but did not otherwise adjust for any\nother impacts, such as the lost future income\nfrom BlackRock and the EPS impact of\nsuspending our common share repurchase program\nduring 2021 (until we closed the BBVA USA\nacquisition).\n\nThis payout represented the Committee's belief\nthat management should be rewarded for\nachieving a strong long-term TSR when measured\nagainst our peer group, and executing on\nstrategic plans to realize PNC's longer-term\nobjectives, while also building up temporary\ncapital during an uncertain economic\nenvironment. The Committee believed that this\npayout appropriately valued PNC's overall\nthree-year performance during a complex and\nunprecedented period of time, and allowed\nmanagement to receive an appropriate reward\nfor the pivotal strategic decisions made in\n2020 and 2021.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        55  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \n                                              \n  Compensation policies and practices         \n                                              \nThe Committee adopts policies and procedures\nto assist in the fulfillment of its duties,\nand we describe some of the significant\npolicies and procedures in this section.

In\napproving a peer group, the Committee analyzes\nseveral factors, including the mix and\ncomplexity of businesses, the markets being\nserved, market capitalization, asset size and\nchanges resulting from mergers or shifts in\nstrategic direction. We also look at the\ncompanies with whom we generally compete for\ntalent.\n\nEach year, the Committee reviews the\ncomposition of the peer group with management\nand its independent compensation consultant.\nFor 2021, the Committee believed that the\nexisting peer group generally provided a\nbalanced mix of institutions considering our\nsize, mix and scope of businesses, products\nand services, and sources of executive talent.\n\nThe peer group currently includes the\nfollowing 11 companies, with assets and market\ncapitalization for PNC and our peer group\nmeasured as of December 31, 2021 and revenue\nfor PNC and our peer group measured for the\nfull year:\n                                              \n                   \u2026            \u2026             \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026             \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026       \u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n           \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n                                              \nAfter a review by the Committee, the peer\ngroup for 2022 remained unchanged from 2021.\n\nExecutive stock ownership and retention\nrequirements\n\nOur executive officers historically have held\na significant portion of their assets in the\nform of our common stock (or other equity-\nbased instruments that reflect the performance\nof our common stock). The Committee believes\nit is important to require our executive\nofficers to meet minimum stock ownership\nguidelines, denominated in PNC shares.\n\nEach executive officer must meet additional\nownership requirements, even after meeting the\noriginal ownership target. The ownership\nrequirements increase the number of PNC shares\nthat an individual must own over time with an\nongoing retention requirement. This retention\nrequirement provides that as new equity awards\nvest, designated executives must retain a\npercentage of the stock, which they must\ngenerally hold until they retire or leave PNC.\nThis ownership policy reflects compensation\nawards over an executive\u2019s career and ties an\nexecutive\u2019s personal wealth closely to the\nlong-term performance of PNC and the interests\nof our shareholders.\n                                              \n  56    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nEquity interests that count toward\nsatisfaction of the ownership guidelines\ninclude shares owned outright by the officer,\nor his or her spouse and dependent children,\nrestricted shares (subject to time-vesting\nrequirements), certain equity awards and\nshares or stock units held in a benefit plan.\nWe do not permit executives to count unvested\nperformance-based securities (i.e., the PSUs)\ntoward satisfaction of the guidelines.

The Committee retains\ndiscretion, to the extent legally permissible,\nto determine that it would not be in PNC\u2019s\nbest interests to seek to enforce the\nclawback.\n\nFor purposes of the negative adjustment\nresulting from risk-related actions, the\nCommittee may reduce or cancel unvested long-\nterm incentive compensation granted to an\nemployee who takes action (or fails to take\naction) that results in, or is reasonably\nexpected to result in, a material adverse\nimpact to PNC or a business unit, such as:\n\n\u2022 Not following applicable risk management\npolicies or procedures;\n\n\u2022 Disregarding the significant risks\nassociated with a course of action for which\nthe employee is responsible;\n\n\u2022 Violating, or permitting or enabling PNC to\nviolate, statutory or regulatory requirements;\nor\n\n\u2022 Not escalating risk concerns to appropriate\nindividuals, committees or other governing\nbodies.\n\nThis applies to individual employees who took\nrisk-related actions (or failed to act) and\ntheir supervisors. The types of adverse\nimpacts could include matters such as impacts\nto the financial performance, capital or\nliquidity positions, reputation or business\nprospects of PNC or a business segment or\ncorporate function within PNC.\n\nThe negative adjustment resulting from risk-\nrelated actions allows PNC to recoup unvested\nequity awards from recipients whose\ninappropriate risk-taking activities have\nresulted in, or are expected to result in, a\nmaterial adverse impact to PNC in the future.\nBy doing so, we can further balance the risks\nin our incentive arrangements by accounting\nfor both forward- and backward-looking risk\nadjustments.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        57  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nThe policy provides that if PNC applies the\npolicy to recoup or clawback incentive\ncompensation or negatively adjust incentive\ncompensation as a result of risk-related\nactions and the underlying factual\ncircumstances are otherwise publicly reported\nby PNC in a filing with the SEC or in\ndisclosure that would otherwise meet the\nrequirements for public disclosure by PNC\nunder the SEC\u2019s Regulation FD, or are\ndisclosed by a third party in a publicly\navailable court or administrative filing, then\nPNC will disclose in the proxy statement for\nits annual shareholder meeting, a current\nreport on Form 8-K or other public filing made\nby it with the SEC or a posting in a clearly\nidentifiable location in the Investor\nRelations section of its corporate website:\n\n\u2022 a general description of the circumstances\ngiving rise to the incentive compensation\nrecovery or adjustment, including items such\nas the number of employees, seniority of\nemployees and line of business impacted; and\n\n\u2022 the aggregate amount of incentive\ncompensation recovered or adjusted.\n\nPNC may limit such disclosure if it would be\nlikely to result in, or exacerbate, any\nexisting or threatened employee, shareholder\nor other litigation, arbitration or proceeding\nagainst PNC.\n                                              \n  Shareholder approval of severance           \n  agreements                                  \n                                              \nWe have a Board-approved policy regarding\nshareholder approval of future severance\narrangements.

We consider a benefit to be a\nperquisite or personal benefit unless its\npurpose is clearly and exclusively business-\nrelated. We determine the value of perquisites\nbased on their incremental cost to us.\n\nThe principal perquisites we may provide to\nour executive officers include financial\nconsulting and tax preparation services and\nlimited personal use of corporate aircraft.\nThe perquisites we provide to our executive\nofficers under the program do not include any\ntax \u201cgross ups.\u201d Some of our executive\nofficers participate in benefit programs or\nreceive perquisites that we no longer offer to\ncurrent executives, including two NEOs who\nremain eligible to receive executive\nphysicals.\n\nCertain executives, including all NEOs (other\nthan our CEO), receive a $10,000 allowance for\npersonal aircraft usage. As the Committee has\npreviously recommended that our CEO take all\nflights (personal or business) on the\ncorporate aircraft, the Committee has approved\nan allowance not to exceed $100,000 for\npersonal flights taken on the corporate\naircraft by our CEO. The cost of any personal\nflights taken on the corporate aircraft that\nexceed this allowance are reimbursed by our\nCEO pursuant to the terms of a time sharing\nagreement that he has entered into with PNC.\n\nDue to certain operational restrictions and\nadministrative efficiencies, we operate our\ncorporate aircraft under Federal Aviation\nAdministration rules and regulations that\nlimit our ability to accept reimbursement for\npersonal aircraft usage unless an individual\nhas a time sharing agreement. The time sharing\nagreement provides a mechanism to obtain\nreimbursement from the executive. The costs\npaid by our CEO under the terms of the\nagreement include incremental costs, as well\nas a federal excise tax and other fees.

Certain plans have discretionary\nand formulaic components, while other plans\nare fully discretionary. For plans with both\ndiscretionary and formulaic components, the\nguidance provides, among other things, that a\ndiscretionary increase in otherwise\nformulaically-determined incentive\ncompensation should be based on behaviors,\nactions or results that are deemed to be\nextraordinary, exceed expectations or provide\nsignificant direct or indirect benefits to PNC\nor our businesses. At the same time, a\ndiscretionary reduction in compensation should\nbe based on behaviors, actions or results that\nfail to meet expectations or negatively impact\nour performance, reputation or work\nenvironment. The guidelines specifically\naddress the need to evaluate both risk-taking\nbehaviors during the performance year, as well\nas the outcome of prior risk-taking behaviors,\nwhen making discretionary incentive\ncompensation decisions. In addition, managers\nare generally required to document how\ndiscretion was applied considering risk-taking\nbehaviors and outcomes in employees\u2019\nperformance evaluations or incentive\ncompensation recommendations, particularly for\nour most senior executives.\n                                              \n  Restrictions on trading, hedging and        \n  pledging                                    \n                                              \nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and\nrelated policies, which apply to our employees\nand directors, include anti-hedging provisions\nthat prohibit all employees and directors from\nday trading or short selling PNC securities\nand from engaging in transactions in any\nderivative of PNC securities (other than\nsecurities issued under a PNC compensation\nplan), including buying and writing options.\n\nWe prohibit certain employees, including all\nexecutive officers, and our directors from\npurchasing or selling our securities beginning\nthe 16 th day of the last month of each\ncalendar quarter until the second business day\nafter we release our earnings for that\nquarter. We may also impose additional trading\nrestrictions on certain employees, including\nour executive officers, and our directors due\nto the availability of material non-public\ninformation regarding PNC or our securities.\nIn addition, we require certain employees,\nincluding all executive officers, to pre-clear\npersonal investments (other than in specified\ntypes of securities) made by them or any of\ntheir immediate family members.\n\nAdditionally, we do not allow directors,\nexecutive officers and certain other senior\nemployees to pledge PNC securities. These\nrestrictions also generally apply to immediate\nfamily members of the covered employees and\ndirectors.\n                                              \n  Consideration of tax deductibility          \n                                              \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code\ndoes not generally allow a company to deduct\ncompensation over $1 million paid to certain\nexecutive officers. Although the Committee\nconsiders the deductibility of expenses when\nit makes compensation decisions, the Committee\nbelieves in maintaining the flexibility and\ncompetitive effectiveness of the executive\ncompensation program. The Committee retains\nthe discretion to establish the compensation\npaid to the NEOs as the Committee determines\nto be in the best interests of PNC and its\nshareholders, and without regard to any\nlimitation provided in Section 162(m).

With each of our\nemployees, we reinforce the importance of\nmanaging risks in executing on our strategic\nobjectives and in support of our desired risk\nappetite.\n\nWe approve our Enterprise Risk Management\nFramework and key risk policies at the Board\nlevel. We discuss our risk management approach\nin the Risk Management section of Item 7 of\nthis year\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe reflect our desired enterprise risk\nappetite by helping to ensure that our\nperformance management and compensation\narrangements for all employees are balanced in\nways that do not create incentives for\nimprudent or excessive risk-taking, are\ndesigned to provide a superior customer\nexperience and are reflective of our business\nmodel, management structure and risk appetite.\n\nOur compensation philosophy supports and\nreflects PNC\u2019s risk appetite and risk\nmanagement culture. Our risk policies and\nprocedures guide our management decisions,\nincluding how we pay employees. By setting and\ncommunicating our risk appetite in advance, we\nseek to manage and control the risks that\nemployees can take or influence, consistent\nwith their roles and responsibilities.\n\nAll employees have performance goals tied to\nbusiness and individual performance, but each\nemployee, no matter their role at PNC, also\nhas customer focus and risk management goals.\nWe evaluate employee performance against these\ngoals, in addition to considering risk\noutcomes from actions taken in prior years. We\nincorporate this comprehensive evaluation of\nemployee risk management into our performance\nand incentive compensation decisions. In\naddition, all employees are encouraged to\ncollaborate across groups to identify and\nmitigate risks and elevate and address\nidentified issues or concerns.\n\nOur compensation program is designed to\nencourage management of risk within our\nappetite and discourage inappropriate risk-\ntaking by granting a diverse portfolio of\nincentive compensation awards to our\nexecutives and other senior employees that is\nexpected to reward desired behavior over time.\nSpecifically, we balance our portfolio of\nawards between fixed and variable\ncompensation; cash and equity-based\ncompensation; and annual and long-term\ncompensation. We base awards on the\nCommittee\u2019s assessment of a variety of\nquantitative and qualitative performance\nmeasurements, both on an absolute and a\nrelative basis. Compensation decisions also\nrely on discretion to consider other factors,\nsuch as effective risk management, delivering\na superior customer experience, compliance\nwith controls and\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        61  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nethical duties, commitment to diversity and\ninclusion, competition for top talent, market-\nbased pay levels and the need to attract and\nengage our leaders.\n\nAs discussed in the CD&A, the long-term\nincentive program includes grants to our NEOs\nand certain other executives that include a\nrisk-based performance metric. Payouts under\nthese grants could be forfeited if we do not\nmeet the CET1 Ratio described on page 48. We\nalso have a broad-based clawback and incentive\ncompensation adjustment policy as described\nbeginning on page 59.\n\nWe maintain an equity program for\napproximately 145 senior leaders below the\nexecutive levels that is designed to help\nensure that their incentive compensation\nawards reflect risk-adjusted performance\noutcomes that would pay out, if at all, over a\nthree-year period. These senior leaders\nreceive a portion of their incentive\ncompensation in an equity-based award that is\nsubject to the same risk-related performance\nmetric that will be applied to the PSU and RSU\ngrants made to NEOs and certain other\nexecutives. Additionally, the equity award\nagreements for these senior leaders all\ncontain an enterprise-wide risk-based review\ntrigger, while the agreements for senior\nleaders in business segments (as opposed to\nthose in administrative or control functions)\ncontain an additional, business-specific risk-\nbased review trigger. If a risk-based review\nis triggered, the applicable review committee\nwill determine whether a downward adjustment\nis warranted, up to a complete cancellation of\nthe share units in that year\u2019s tranche.\n                                              \n  Risk review of compensation plans           \n                                              \nOur Chief Risk Officer reports at least\nquarterly to the Human Resources Committee to\ndiscuss risk management and review the\nconnection between effective risk management\nand incentive compensation. The Chief Risk\nOfficer also presents the Committee with a\nrisk assessment for each of our principal\nbusiness units and a collective assessment of\nstaff functions, including finance, human\nresources, legal, operations and technology.\nIn addition, we maintain at least one director\nwho is a member of both the Human Resources\nand Risk Committees. At present, PNC's lead\ndirector, who is a member of the Risk\nCommittee, also serves on the Human Resources\nCommittee.\n\nWe also have systematically identified\nindividuals who could potentially expose us to\nmaterial amounts of risk or financial loss. As\nwith our incentive compensation risk\nassessment described below, we have\nestablished a cross-functional team that\ncontinues to identify and monitor these\nindividuals. These individuals are subject to\na supplemental risk management review as part\nof the performance management process by the\nChief Risk Officer and his designees \u2014 we take\nthis review into account when determining\nincentive compensation awards for our most\nsenior executives.\n\nWe have developed a standardized governance\nframework for our incentive compensation plans\nto help monitor and validate that our plans\nbalance risk and reward, comply with\napplicable laws and regulations, demonstrate\nfiscal responsibility and maintain an\nappropriate customer focus. T his framework\nhelps to ensure that we have the appropriate\nprocedures, controls and independent\nchallenges in place to do so. We continue to\nassess and, where appropriate, modify our\nincentive compensation plans in accordance\nwith this framework to help ensure our plans\nappropriately reflect risk considerations,\nincluding the management of identified issues,\nthe duration of the risks and alignment with\nour desired risk appetite. Examples of\nincentive plan modifications include:\n\n\u2022 Adding or increasing the visibility of risk\nand customer focus metrics to plans based on\nthe structure of the plan and the nature of\nthe business and the roles of participants\n\n\u2022 Adding or formalizing language around\ndelaying award payments or recapture or\nreduction of payments where subsequent risk\nmetrics indicate excessive risk-taking\n\n\u2022 Enhancing documentation of the plan design\nand use of discretion in non-formulaic plans\nat the pool funding, business allocation or\nindividual award level\n\nBased on our approach to risk management, our\ncomprehensive incentive plan governance\nframework, our risk assessments for\nsignificant businesses and staff functions,\nand the inclusion of risk-based metrics in our\nlong-term incentive compensation programs, we\nbelieve that the risks arising from our\ncompensation plans, policies and practices are\nnot reasonably likely to have a material\nadverse effect on PNC.\n                                              \n  62    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Summary compensation table                  \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                                              \n(a) This column includes any salary amounts\ndeferred by an NEO under qualified (ISP) or\nnon-qualified (DCIP) benefit plans.

This column includes\nthe costs of financial consulting and tax\npreparation services for Mr. Demchak, Mr.\nReilly, Mr. Parsley and Ms. Larrimer, and\npersonal use of corporate aircraft by Mr.\nDemchak, Mr. Lyons and Ms. Larrimer during\n2021. The incremental cost of Mr. Demchak\u2019s\nuse of the aircraft in 2021 was $99,864. Mr.\nDemchak used his time sharing agreement for\nflights in excess of this amount during 2021.\nThe incremental cost to PNC of personal\naircraft use is calculated by multiplying the\ntotal number of personal flight hours by the\naverage direct variable operating costs\n(including costs related to fuel, maintenance\nexpenses related to operation of the plane\nduring the year, and landing and parking fees)\nper flight hour for the particular aircraft\nfor the year, plus crew expenses attributable\nto the personal use. Since the aircraft are\nused primarily for business travel, we do not\ninclude in the calculation the fixed costs\nthat do not change based on usage, such as\ncrew salaries and other maintenance and\ninspection and capital improvement costs\nintended to cover a multiple-year period. The\nNEOs each have a corporate travel credit card\nnot generally available to all employees, for\nwhich there is no incremental cost to PNC.\n\n** We pay premiums for certain of the NEOs in\nconnection with our Key Executive Equity\nProgram, which is a split-dollar insurance\narrangement. In addition, we pay long-term\ndisability premiums on behalf of certain of\nour NEOs. New participants have not been\npermitted in either program since 2007. The\ndollar amounts under the \u201cInsurance Premiums\u201d\ncolumn include the 2021 premiums we paid in\nconnection with our Key Executive Equity\nProgram on behalf of Mr. Demchak ($40,534) and\nMr. Reilly ($16,732). These premiums represent\nthe full dollar amounts we paid for both the\nterm and non-term portions of this plan.

The pension plan is a\ndefined benefit cash balance pension plan\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), and is\nintended to be qualified under Section 401(a)\nof the Internal Revenue Code. Each calendar\nquarter, eligible participants receive\n\u201cearnings credits\u201d based on a percentage of\neligible compensation. Earnings credit\npercentages for employees who were plan\nparticipants on December 31, 2009 are based on\na schedule using the participant\u2019s age and\nyears of credited service at that date and are\nfrozen at that level. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who become participants on or after\nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible\ncompensation.\n\nThe plan defines eligible \u201ccompensation\u201d as\nregular earnings plus eligible variable\ncompensation, such as paid annual incentives.\nEligible \u201ccompensation\u201d does not include\ndeferrals under the terms of the non-qualified\ndeferred compensation and incentive plan;\nthese are instead taken into account under our\nexcess pension plan described below. We\ngenerally limit eligible variable compensation\nfor a plan year to a total of 100% of the\nfirst $25,000 plus 50% of the next $225,000.\n\nFor participants who had accrued benefits\nprior to 1999 under the pension plan formula\nthen in effect, an initial cash balance\n\u201caccount\u201d was established based on the present\nvalue of the accrued benefits at the time of\nthe conversion to the current program.\n\nPlan participants generally receive quarterly\n\u201cinterest credits\u201d at a rate of one-fourth of\nthe annual interest rate on 30-year Treasury\nsecurities. Employees who were already plan\nparticipants as of December 31, 2009 receive a\nminimum interest credit.\n\nAt the end of 2008, the cash balance pension\nplan previously sponsored by National City\nCorporation was merged into this plan.\nEarnings and interest credits for National\nCity participants are generally as noted\nabove.\n\nWe contribute to the plan an actuarially\ndetermined amount necessary to fund the total\nbenefits payable to participants. Actuaries\ncalculate total contributions instead of\ncontributions for each individual participant.\n                                              \n  Excess pension plan.                        \n                                              \nWe maintain an ERISA excess pension plan,\nwhich is a supplemental non-qualified pension\nplan. The excess benefits under this plan\nequal the difference, if any, between a\nparticipant\u2019s benefit under the qualified\npension plan computed without regard to\napplicable Internal Revenue Code limits and\ntaking into account amounts deferred under the\nnon-qualified deferred compensation and\nincentive plan, and the participant\u2019s actual\nbenefit under the qualified pension plan.\n                                              \n  Supplemental executive retirement plan.     \n                                              \nWe maintain a supplemental executive\nretirement plan for certain executive\nofficers. As part of its ongoing review of\ncompensation practices, the Human Resources\nCommittee decided in 2007 to eliminate future\nplan participation for new executive officers.\nThis plan provides earnings credits based on a\npercentage of annual incentives awarded under\neligible executive bonus plans in accordance\nwith a schedule based on the participant\u2019s age\nand years of credited service. This plan also\nprovides quarterly interest credits that\nmirror the interest credits under the\nqualified pension plan.\n\nExecutive officers who participated in the\nsupplemental executive retirement plan on\nDecember 31, 1998 and who were at least age 50\nwith five or more years of credited service\nreceive grandfathered benefits based on the\npension formula in effect prior to 1999. For\nexecutive officers at or above a certain\norganizational level who participated on\nDecember 31, 1998 but who did not meet the\nrequirements for grandfathered benefits, we\ndoubled the earnings credit percentages in\norder to mitigate the effect of the transition\nto the cash balance pension formula.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        69  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \n                                              \n                 Num\u2026          Pres\u2026          \n                   of          Value    Pay\u2026  \n                 Yea\u2026             of    Dur\u2026  \n                 Cre\u2026          Accu\u2026    Last  \n         Plan    Ser\u2026          Bene\u2026    Fis\u2026  \n  NEO    Name    (#)\u2026          ($)(\u2026    Year  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Wi\u2026    Qua\u2026                                 \n  S.

Credited service, where\napplicable, is generally equal to actual full\nyears of service; however, for purposes of\ndetermining the level of benefits earned in\nthe Qualified Pension Plan and ERISA Excess\nPension Plan, credited service has been frozen\nas of December 31, 2009. As of that date, the\nNEOs had the following years of credited\nservice: Mr. Demchak, 7; Mr. Reilly, 22; Mr.\nParsley, 6; and Ms. Larrimer, 14. Mr. Lyons\nwas hired after service accruals ceased to be\napplicable for purposes of calculating the\namount of Qualified Pension Plan and ERISA\nExcess Pension Plan benefits.\n\n(b) We compute the present values shown here\nas of December 31, 2021 in accordance with\nFASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation\u2014Retirement\nBenefits, as specified in applicable SEC\nregulations. The amounts do not necessarily\nreflect the amounts to which the NEOs would be\nentitled under the terms of these plans as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nWe calculate the present values for the plans\nby projecting the December 31, 2021 account\nbalances to an assumed retirement age of 65,\nusing an interest crediting rate of (i) 4.40%\nfor Mr. Demchak, Mr. Reilly, Mr. Parsley and\nMs. Larrimer, and (ii) 1.65% for Mr. Lyons,\nwho is not eligible for the guaranteed minimum\nannual interest crediting rate since he became\na plan participant after January 1, 2010. We\nthen apply a discount rate of 2.90% for the\nQualified Pension Plan and 2.65% for other\nplans to discount the balances back to\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nSee Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021\nfor additional information regarding the\ndiscount rates and other material assumptions.\n                                              \n  70    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \nNon-qualified deferred compensation in fiscal\n2021\n\nWe offer an incentive savings plan (\"ISP\") in\nwhich most of our employees can participate\nafter they meet any applicable service\nrequirements, and for designated employees who\nexceed a compensation threshold, we also offer\na non-qualified deferred compensation and\nincentive plan (\"DCIP\"). Prior to establishing\nthe DCIP in 2012, we offered a non-qualified\nsupplemental incentive savings plan (\"SISP\"),\nwhich was a supplement to the ISP, and a non-\nqualified deferred compensation plan (\"DCP\"),\nin each case for certain designated employees\nwho exceeded applicable compensation\nthresholds.\n                                              \n  Incentive savings plan (ISP).               \n                                              \nThe ISP is a defined contribution 401(k) plan\nthat is intended to be qualified under Section\n401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. During\n2021, participants could elect to contribute\nbetween 1% and 75% of eligible compensation to\nthe plan each year as pre-tax or Roth after-\ntax elective deferrals (or a combination of\npre-tax and Roth after-tax elective\ndeferrals), subject to Internal Revenue Code\nlimits. Participants who are age 50 or older\nmay contribute additional pre-tax amounts\ncalled \u201ccatch-up contributions\u201d each year. For\n2021, we made employer matching contributions\non behalf of eligible participants equal to\n100% of elective deferrals up to 4% of\neligible compensation. Matching contributions\nwere made in cash. Participants direct the\ninvestment of their accounts among the\ninvestment options offered under the plan, and\ntheir account balances are adjusted for gains\nor losses resulting from those investment\ndirections.\n                                              \n  Deferred compensation and incentive plan    \n  (DCIP).                                     \n                                              \nWe maintain a DCIP for designated employees\nwho exceed a compensation threshold.\nParticipants can elect to defer up to 20% of\nbase salary and/or up to 75% of eligible\nshort-term incentive pay earned with respect\nto a plan year. The DCIP\u2019s plan year is the\ncalendar year. Participants can direct the\ninvestment of their accounts among the\nhypothetical investment alternatives made\navailable under the plan, and their accounts\nare adjusted for deemed investment gains or\nlosses resulting from such investment\ndirections.\n\nSupplemental incentive savings plan (SISP) and\ndeferred compensation plan (DCP). Effective\nJanuary 1, 2012, the SISP and DCP were frozen\nto new participants and to the deferral of\namounts earned on and after January 1, 2012.\nDistributions from these plans are paid in\ncash in accordance with the participant\u2019s\nelection. Participants with existing account\nbalances can direct the investment of their\naccounts among the hypothetical investment\nalternatives made available under the plan,\nand their accounts are adjusted for deemed\ninvestment gains or losses resulting from such\ninvestment directions.\n                                              \n  Investment options.                         \n                                              \nISP, DCIP, SISP and DCP participants have the\ninvestment options listed on page 75.

may receive various forms of\ncompensation or benefits in connection with a\ntermination of employment. These benefits\nresult from:\n\n\u2022 change of control agreements,\n\n\u2022 the terms of our equity-based grants, and\n\n\u2022 other existing plans and arrangements in\nwhich our NEOs participate.\n\nWe do not have a separate severance plan or\nprogram for the NEOs. The Human Resources\nCommittee has discretion to provide severance\nbenefits subject to the parameters of our\nBoard-approved policy, as described in the\nCD&A on page 60.\n\nThe benefits an executive may receive will\ndepend on whether PNC or the executive\nterminated employment and, if PNC terminated\nemployment, whether the termination was for\ncause, resulted from death or disability, or\nfollowed a change in control, and whether the\nexecutive is retirement-eligible. If a\nretirement-eligible employee resigns or is\nterminated without cause, we consider it a\nretirement. For these purposes, a \u201cretirement-\neligible\u201d employee is someone who is at least\n55 years old and has at least five years of\nservice with PNC. As of December 31, 2021,\nfour of our NEOs were retirement-eligible.\n                                              \n  Change of control agreements                \n                                              \nAs of December 31, 2021, we have entered into\nseparate change of control agreements with\neach of our NEOs and similar agreements with a\nlimited group of other senior officers. These\nagreements have been a valuable component of\nour executive compensation program for several\nyears. We believe these arrangements mitigate\nconcerns arising from a change of control, and\nhelp to ensure the continued dedicated service\nof our key employees. Cash payments\ncontemplated by these agreements require a\n\u201cdouble trigger\u201d \u2014 that is, the occurrence of\nboth a change of control and a qualifying\ntermination of employment. A qualifying\ntermination would occur if the executive\nresigned for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or the surviving\ncompany terminated the executive other than\nfor \u201cCause,\u201d \u201cDisability\u201d or death (each as\ndefined in the change of control agreement).\nThe treatment of equity awards upon a change\nof control is addressed in the equity award\nagreements themselves, as described below,\nrather than the change of control agreements.\n\nThe change of control agreements provide for\ncash payments to our NEOs calculated based on\nvarious compensation components, including\nannual base salary and an annual incentive\naward (bonus). For purposes of the change of\ncontrol agreements, annual base salary is\nequal to 12 times the highest monthly base\nsalary rate payable to the executive in the\n12-month period preceding the month of the\nchange of control. The cash payment related to\nbase salary is equal to two times the annual\nbase salary, and the cash payment related to\nbonus is equal to two times the applicable\nbonus percentage multiplied by annual base\nsalary. The agreements also provide for\ncontinued benefits under (or compute cash\npayments by reference to) certain of our\nretirement and health and welfare benefit\nplans.\n\nNone of our change of control agreements\ncontain any excise tax \u201cgross-up\u201d provisions.\nOur current change of control agreements\nprovide that in the event the benefits payable\nto an executive trigger excise taxes under\nSection 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the\nexecutive will be entitled to a reduction in\nbenefits so that no excise tax is imposed if\nsuch a reduction would result in a greater net\n(after-tax) benefit to the executive than\npayment of the full amount of his or her\nbenefits. We have a Board-approved policy that\nrequires shareholder approval of certain\nfuture severance arrangements if the\narrangement provides for additional severance\nbenefits in an amount exceeding 2.99 times the\nsum of the executive\u2019s annual base salary and\ntarget bonus.\n\nThe change of control agreements prohibit the\nexecutives from employing or soliciting any of\nour officers during the one-year period\nfollowing termination, and from using or\ndisclosing any of our confidential business or\ntechnical information or trade secrets.\n\nWhile the benefits to be received under a\nchange of control agreement may be significant\nto an individual, they first require the\noccurrence of a significant transaction. As a\nresult, the benefits are highly speculative\nand are contingent on a variety of facts and\ncircumstances. In recognition of this, the\nHuman Resources Committee of the Board does\nnot consider the amount of potential change in\ncontrol payments when it makes annual\ncompensation decisions for our NEOs. Change in\ncontrol protections, although meaningful, also\nbecome relatively less significant to PNC as\nwe increase in size.\n                                              \n  74    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Equity-based grants                         \n                                              \nIf an NEO resigns or the NEO\u2019s employment is\nterminated with or without cause, any unvested\nequity-based compensation is generally\nforfeited. However, if an NEO retires (i.e., a\nretirement-eligible NEO resigns or is\nterminated without cause), equity-based\ncompensation is not forfeited and continues in\neffect until its originally scheduled payment\ndate. Equity-based compensation is also not\nforfeited under certain circumstances\nfollowing a change in control. Grants to our\nexecutive officers contain a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d\nfeature, meaning such grants require the\noccurrence of both a change in control and a\nqualifying termination (which includes a\ntermination without cause or a resignation for\ngood reason) in order to vest prior to the\noriginal vesting date in connection with a\nchange in control.\n\nA change in control of PNC, retirement of an\nNEO or termination of an NEO\u2019s employment by\nPNC by reason of disability has the following\nimpact on unvested equity-based compensation:\n                                              \n   RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  Change in       Retirement      Disability  \n  Control                                     \n  Following a                                 \n  change in                                   \n  control,                                    \n  outstanding                                 \n  RSUs will                                   \n  vest upon a                                 \n  qualifying                                  \n  termination                                 \n  or continued                                \n  employment                                  \n  through the                                 \n  original                                    \n  vesting                                     \n  date, and                                   \n  will be paid                                \n  as soon as                                  \n  practicable                                 \n  following       RSUs                        \n  the original    continue in                 \n  vesting         effect in                   \n  date.

In addition, Mr. Demchak, Mr.\nReilly, Mr. Parsley and Ms. Larrimer\nparticipate in our SISP, and Mr. Demchak and\nMr. Reilly participate in our DCP (although\nthey may no longer make contributions to these\nplans). The NEOs earn these benefits for\nservices provided to us while employed, and\nmany of these plans are also available on a\nbroader basis to other employees. For the most\npart, an NEO\u2019s entitlement to these benefits\ndoes not depend on how employment is\nterminated.\n\nMr. Demchak and Mr. Reilly also participate in\nour supplemental executive retirement plan, a\ncompany-paid executive long-term disability\n(\"LTD\") program, and the Key Executive Equity\nProgram (\"KEEP\"), a split-dollar life\ninsurance program. Participants in the\nexecutive LTD program are generally eligible\nfor additional LTD benefits of $10,000 per\nmonth until they are no longer disabled or\nhave reached age 65. KEEP provides benefits in\nthe event of a participating executive\u2019s death\nwhile actively employed (equal to 1.5 times\nthen-current annual base salary) or following\nan eligible retirement (retirement after\nreaching age 55 and five years of service with\nPNC, generally equal to annual base salary\nprior to retirement). Following a change in\ncontrol, the life insurance policy would\ntransfer to the participating executive. The\nsupplemental executive retirement plan,\nexecutive LTD program and KEEP were frozen to\nnew participants as of December 31, 2007.\n\nCertain NEOs are also eligible to receive two\nyears of company-paid financial planning and\ntax preparation services upon retirement.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        75  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Estimated benefits upon termination         \n                                              \nThe following table shows the estimated\nincremental benefits payable to our NEOs as of\nDecember 31, 2021 as a result of termination\nof employment in a variety of situations.\nThese estimated amounts have been calculated\nas if employment was terminated on December\n31, 2021. For change in control benefits, we\nassumed a change in control of PNC and a\ntermination of employment by the surviving\ncompany without cause (or a resignation of the\nofficer for good reason) on that date. To the\nextent relevant, the amounts assume a PNC\nstock price of $200.52, the closing price of\nour common stock on December 31, 2021. If we\ncalculated these amounts using a different\nprice, the amounts could be significantly\ndifferent. The benefits below do not include\nthe balances under our qualified cash balance\npension plan, ERISA excess pension plan,\nsupplemental executive retirement plan, SISP,\nISP, DCIP or DCP unless the NEO receives an\nenhanced benefit under the termination\nscenario.

Demchak, our\nChairman, President and CEO, and the annual\ntotal compensation of our median employee\n(other than Mr. Demchak).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of Mr. Demchak\nwas $17,527,319\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of our median\nemployee was $78,333 (see below for an\nexplanation of how we calculate this amount)\n\n\u2022 The resulting ratio of Mr. Demchak's annual\ntotal compensation to the annual total\ncompensation of our median employee is 224 to\n1\n\nWe believe our ratio represents a reasonable\nestimate, calculated in a manner consistent\nwith SEC rules, based on the following\nmethodology:\n\n\u2022 To identify the median employee, we used the\nForm W-2 (Box 5) issued by the IRS for federal\ntax purposes as the compensation measure and\nevaluated the compensation for 51,865 active\nU.S. employees as of December 31, 2021 (this\npopulation excluded Mr. Demchak, all of our\n132 non-U.S. employees 1 and the 7,469\nemployees that became our employees as a\nresult of our acquisition of BBVA USA in June\n2021). We did not annualize the compensation\nof any employee who was employed by us for\npart of the year.\n\n\u2022 We calculated the 2021 annual total\ncompensation for the median employee 2\n1 As of December 31, 2021, we had 80 employees\nin the UK, 38 employees in Canada and 14\nemployees in Germany, representing less than\n1% of our total employee population.\n\n2 We calculated the annual total compensation\nfor the median employee in accordance with SEC\nrules, using the same methodology used to\ncalculate Mr. Demchak\u2019s total compensation in\nthe Summary compensation table, and we also\nincluded PNC\u2019s health care premium\ncontributions for both the median employee and\nMr. Demchak. As a result, Mr. Demchak\u2019s annual\ntotal compensation for pay ratio purposes is\nslightly higher than the amount reported for\nhim in the Summary compensation table on page\n65.\n                                              \n  78    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF       \n   EMPLOYMENT                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n   SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND       \n   CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS                  \n                                              \nSecurity ownership of directors and executive\nofficers\n\nThe table below sets forth information\nregarding ownership of our common stock by our\ndirectors and executive officers.

In\nconnection with this responsibility, the\nCommittee evaluates, monitors and reports to\nthe Board regarding the independence,\nqualifications and performance of the\nindependent auditors, including an evaluation\nof the lead audit partner. The Committee\napproves all audit engagement fees and terms\nassociated with the retention of the\nindependent auditors. The Audit Committee\ncharter requires the Committee to consider,\nnot less frequently than when the lead audit\npartner is rotated, whether PNC should adopt a\npolicy of regular rotation of the independent\naudit firm. In addition to assuring the\nrequired rotation of the lead audit partner,\nthe Committee oversees the selection of the\nnew lead audit partner and the chair of the\nCommittee participates directly in the\nselection of the new lead audit partner.\n\nThe Audit Committee has selected\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\"PwC\") as our\nindependent auditors for 2022. PwC has been\nour independent auditors since 2007. In making\nthis selection, the Committee considered\nwhether there should be a rotation of the\nindependent audit firm. It also carefully\nconsidered, among other things, PwC's\nqualifications and performance, the quality\nand candor of its communications with the\nCommittee and PNC, and its independence,\nobjectivity and professional skepticism. On\nFebruary 10, 2022, the Committee presented its\nconclusions regarding the selection and\nappointment of PwC as our independent auditors\nto the Board, including a determination that\nthe selection of PwC as our independent\nauditors is in the best interest of PNC.\nFollowing this presentation, the Board voted\nunanimously to recommend that shareholders\nvote to ratify the Committee\u2019s selection of\nPwC as our independent registered public\naccounting firm for 2022. The Committee and\nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof PwC as our independent auditors is in the\nbest interest of PNC.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Board have adopted\na policy that if the ratification of the\nindependent auditors does not receive a\nmajority of the votes cast at the annual\nmeeting, the Committee will reconsider its\nselection of independent auditors. However,\nthe Committee will be under no obligation to\nselect new independent auditors. If the\nCommittee does select new independent auditors\nfor 2022, we will not seek shareholder\nratification of the new selection.\n\nWe expect representatives of PwC to be\navailable during the annual meeting.

The Committee is given\nthis responsibility to confirm that providing\nservices will not impair our auditors\u2019\nindependence. The Committee performs this\nfunction for us and our subsidiaries.\n\nThe Audit Committee\u2019s responsibility also\nincludes pre-approval of the fees for such\nservices (although SEC regulations do not\nrequire the pre-approval of fees) and the\nother terms of the engagement. The Committee\nmay either pre-approve specific fees or a\nmethodology for determining fees. Any proposed\nincrease in fees that exceeds the pre-approved\namounts requires the Committee\u2019s approval.\n\nPre-approval may be general (categories of\nservices) or specific (individual services).\nIf the Audit Committee pre-approves a general\ncategory of services, it will review the scope\nof services related to such general pre-\napproval at least annually. The Committee is\nresponsible for approving any fee or other\ncompensation arrangements for services covered\nby a pre-approval of a general category of\nservices.\n\nThe full Audit Committee may exercise pre-\napproval authority, or the chair of the\nCommittee may exercise the authority as\nrequired between meetings. The Committee may\nalso delegate this authority, in whole or in\npart, to one or more Committee members. Any\nperson exercising delegated authority reports\non the pre-approvals at the next scheduled\nmeeting of the Committee, which will be\nreflected in the meeting minutes.\n\nThe Committee may not delegate its pre-\napproval authority to any other person,\nincluding any member of management or other\nPNC employee or agent.\n\nThe written request for pre-approval includes,\nat a minimum, a description of the nature of\nthe engagement, the proposed fee for the\nservices and a statement that the services to\nbe performed by the independent auditor are\nconsistent with SEC and other applicable rules\non auditor independence. In addition, each\npre-approval request is reviewed by the\nindependent auditor to confirm the provision\nof services is consistent with SEC and other\napplicable auditor independence rules. All\nrequests for pre-approval of services are\nreviewed by management to ensure the services\nare permitted under SEC regulations and the\nAudit Committee charter and include a\nrecommendation of the proposal by the Chief\nFinancial Officer or the Controller and the\nGeneral Auditor. In reviewing a pre-approval\nrequest, the Committee or the chair of the\nCommittee may request that members of\nmanagement provide their views on auditor\nindependence questions.\n\nThe Controller or a designee of the Controller\nreports to the Audit Committee at least\nquarterly as to the status of services that\nhave been pre-approved and the related fees.\n\nThe Committee may amend these procedures from\ntime to time.\n\nAll audit services, audit-related services and\npermitted non-audit services and related fees\ndisclosed above were pre-approved by the Audit\nCommittee.\n                                              \n  82    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2022 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE              \n                                              \nThe Audit Committee\u2019s job is one of oversight,\nas set forth in its charter.

The\nindependent auditors are responsible for the\naudit of PNC\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and the audit of the effectiveness\nof PNC\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting.\n\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed\nPNC\u2019s audited consolidated financial\nstatements with management and with\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\"PwC\"), PNC\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor 2021.

A portion\nof the Audit Committee\u2019s review and discussion\nof PNC\u2019s audited consolidated financial\nstatements with PwC occurred in private\nsessions, without PNC management present.\n\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with PwC the\nmatters required to be discussed by the\napplicable requirements of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (the \"PCAOB\") and\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n\"SEC\").\n\nThe Audit Committee has received the written\ndisclosures and the letter from PwC required\nby applicable requirements of the PCAOB\nregarding the independent accountant\u2019s\ncommunications with the Audit Committee\nconcerning independence, and has discussed\nPwC\u2019s independence with representatives of\nPwC.\n\nBased on the review and discussions referred\nto above, the Audit Committee has recommended\nto the Board of Directors that the audited\nconsolidated financial statements be included\nin PNC\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, for filing with\nthe SEC.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nof The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n                                              \n  Richard J.

After our shareholders voted in 2017,\nthe Board affirmed that recommendation and\nelected to hold future say-on-pay advisory\nvotes on an annual basis, until the next\nshareholder vote on say-on-pay frequency. We\nexpect to conduct the next shareholder vote on\nsay-on-pay frequency at our 2023 annual\nmeeting of shareholders.\n\nWith this item, shareholders may submit an\nadvisory vote on the compensation of our CEO\nand the other four executive officers named in\nthe Summary compensation table on page 65. The\nSummary compensation table provides an annual\nsnapshot of the compensation paid or granted\nto our NEOs.\nWhat does it mean to have a \u201csay-on-pay\u201d\nadvisory vote?\nAs an advisory vote, the outcome will not bind\nPNC or the Board. We will disclose how many\nshareholders voted \u201cFor\u201d and \u201cAgainst\u201d the\nresolution and how many shareholders abstained\nfrom voting.\n\nWe believe in soliciting input from our\nshareholders throughout the year on a variety\nof issues, and this advisory vote fits within\nour broader shareholder engagement efforts.\nLast year, over 95% of the votes cast by our\nshareholders approved the compensation of our\nnamed executive officers, and we have averaged\nover 96% support in say-on-pay votes over the\npast five years.\n\nWhile this vote is non-binding, the Board\nvalues the opinions of shareholders and will\ncarefully consider the results when making\nfuture compensation decisions. In considering\nan overall executive compensation program,\nsay-on-pay cannot convey a shareholder\u2019s view\non a discrete element of our compensation\nprogram or a specific decision made by the\nHuman Resources Committee. Each year, the\nCommittee receives reports on the outcome of\nthe say-on-pay vote, how our say-on-pay vote\ncompared to our peers and other large public\ncompanies, and whether any changes to the\ncompensation program were being recommended\nfor the Committee\u2019s consideration in light of\nthe results. The Committee expects to\nundertake a similar evaluation this year.\nWhere can I find more information on executive\ncompensation?\nWe describe our executive compensation program\nand the compensation awarded under that\nprogram in the CD&A, the compensation tables\nand the related disclosure contained in this\nproxy statement. See pages 41 to 80 for\nadditional information.\nWhat are some of the performance and\ncompensation program highlights for 2021?\nPlease review the CD&A, which begins on page\n41, as well as the accompanying compensation\ntables and related disclosure beginning on\npage 65. Performance and compensation program\nhighlights for 2021, which are included in the\nCD&A, should be read in conjunction with the\nfull CD&A, the compensation tables and the\nrelated disclosure contained in this proxy\nstatement.\n\nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR\nthe following advisory resolution:\n\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the holders of the common\nstock and the voting preferred stock of The\nPNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

PNC's processes\nappear to lack an analysis of social risks, as\nit has not publicly identified any sectors\nthat require elevated due diligence because of\nexposure to social risk. 8\n\nPNC faces significant legal, financial, and\nreputational risks if it continues to be\nlinked to the nuclear weapons industry.\nFollowing the Treaty on the Prohibition of\nNuclear Weapons' entry into force in January\n2021, investor screens for nuclear weapons\ncompanies have been increasing. Over 90\nfinancial institutions appear to have stopped\nfunding activities to the nuclear weapons\nindustry, and at least 35 financial\ninstitutions have adopted policies to prohibit\nlending altogether. 9\n\nIn response to public pressure, PNC\nreevaluated its financing of private prisons\nand mountaintop removal mining. 10 Despite the\nsevere human rights risk and business risks\nfrom nuclear weapons financing, PNC has failed\nto take similar action.\n\nIncreasing scrutiny of lending practices and\ninternational pressure for nuclear disarmament\nescalates the risk to PNC and exposes the\ncompany to reputational risk as a retail\nbanker. For example, the 'Stop Banking the\nBomb Campaign' has held over 75 demonstrations\noutside of PNC offices, including during PNC's\nshareholder meetings, calling for divestment\nfrom nuclear weapons manufacturers. 11\n3 https://www.ihrb.org/uploads/submissions/Joh\nn_Ruggie_Comments_Thun_Banks_Feb_2017.pdf\n\n4 https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/11/2021-Perilous-\nProfiteering-final.pdf\n\n5 https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/A\nCT3008932019ENGLISH.PDF\n\n6\nhttps://www.icrc.org/en/document/humanitarian-\nimpacts-and-risks-use-nuclear-weapons\n\n7 https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/t\npnw/\n\n8 https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/corporate-\nresponsibility/corporate-social-\nresponsibility/governance-risk/values-\nbusiness.html\n\n9 https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/\n\n10 https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/corporate-\nresponsibility/corporate-social-\nresponsibility/governance-risk/values-\nbusiness.html;\nhttps://www.pnc.com/content/dam/pnc-\ncom/pdf/aboutpnc/CSR/PNC_2019_CSR_Report.pdf\n\n11 http://www.nuclearban.us/stop-banking-the-\nbomb-the-campaign-to-get-pnc-bank-to-divest-\nfrom-nuclear-weapons/;\nhttps://newpeoplenewspaper.com/2020/07/31/stop\n-banking-the-bomb-resumes-pickets-at-pnc/\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        85  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Board of Directors Response                 \n                                              \nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST this\nProposal because:\n\n\u2022 In February 2022, the Board reviewed PNC's\nlending relationships with the companies the\nco-filers have characterized as \"nuclear\nweapons companies,\" and the potential risks\nthey represent. The Board concluded that these\nrelationships do not pose a material credit,\nlegal or reputational risk to PNC and were\nappropriately vetted for potential\nenvironmental and human rights risks through\nPNC's Environmental and Social Risk Management\n(\"ESRM\") framework.\n\n\u2022 PNC's credit to these companies is de\nminimis, representing 0.2% of PNC's total\ncredit commitments as of December 31, 2021;\nPNC's lending represents approximately 2% of\nthese companies' capital structures; and an\nindependent third party ranked PNC 59th among\nfinancial organizations in its exposure to\nthese types of companies, while the\ninstitutions ranked ahead of PNC have, in\naggregate, over 312 times more exposure. 12\n\n\u2022 The loans relevant to this proposal are\nsubject to a management-level environmental\nand human rights risk assessment pursuant to\nPNC's ESRM framework which is applied to all\nlending decisions. PNC has historically found\nno environmental, social and governance risks\nthat would inherently exclude these loan\nrecipients from the application of PNC's fair\nand consistent lending guidelines. The Board\nis regularly updated on the ESRM framework and\nas a result of shareholder feedback commits to\nannually review PNC's ESRM framework to\nensure: (i) that it continues to be\nappropriate for PNC's expanding business, the\nshifting risk landscape, and heightened\nenvironmental, social, human rights and\nreputational risk considerations; and (ii)\nthat it continues to appropriately balance the\nneeds of our customers and prospective\ncustomers with the interests of our other\nstakeholders, including investors, communities\nand employees.\n\n\u2022 The companies the co-filers have\ncharacterized as \"nuclear weapons companies,\"\ninclude large and diversified companies like\nBoeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and\nJacobs Engineering Group 13 that provide a\nmyriad of products and services that benefit\nsociety and enhance the quality of human life.\nThe vast majority of these company operations\nand revenue bear no relationship to nuclear\nweapons.\n\nPNC's credit to the companies the co-filers\nhave characterized as \"nuclear weapons\ncompanies\" is de minimis, representing 0.16%\nof PNC's total loan portfolio and 0.20% of\nPNC's total credit commitments as of December\n31, 2021. PNC also represents a very small\nportion of these companies' capital structures\n(approximately 2%). An independent report\nproduced by PAX in conjunction with the\nInternational Campaign to Abolish Nuclear\nWeapons (ICAN) ranks PNC 59th among financial\norganizations in terms of total financing\nexposure to the types of companies at issue,\nand the institutions ahead of PNC have in\naggregate over 312 times more exposure.\n\nPNC's decisions to lend to these companies are\nconsistent with standard U.S. banking\npractices. The co-filers cite to the Treaty on\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (\"TPNW\") as\nan \"in force\" pact triggering increased\nscrutiny of lending practices to these\ncompanies. In fact, the United States, Britain\nand France, among other countries, have\nrejected the TPNW as it \"turns back the clock\non verification and disarmament and is\ndangerous to the half-century-old Nuclear\nNonproliferation Treaty (to which the United\nStates is a signatory), considered the\ncornerstone of global nonproliferation\nefforts.\" 14 Further, we are not aware of a\nsingle U.S. bank that has adopted policies to\nprohibit lending to or stopped funding\ncompanies the co-filers have characterized as\nassociated with the nuclear defense industry.\n15\n\nPNC management applies a multi-layered ESRM\nprocess to all corporate lending, which\nincludes a Rapid Risk Screen that subjects\nevery Corporate & Institutional Banking\ntransaction to a baseline environmental and\nhuman rights risk assessment. This assessment\nis industry-agnostic, and is applied to every\ntransaction \u2014 no matter the size. It is\ndesigned to be modular, so that as PNC's\nbusiness changes, the company can quickly\ndevelop and communicate enhancements to the\ntool. Such changes could occur when PNC enters\nnew markets or new industries, or as the\nexternal risk landscape shifts, to ensure the\ncompany's practices continue to take into\nconsideration pertinent risks, including\nemergent risks. Transactions flagged by the\nscreening are escalated to leaders in the\nbusiness and underwriting groups, who\ndetermine whether to pass on the transaction,\ndo enhanced due diligence alongside the\ncompany's ESG team, or proceed as requested.\n\nPNC strives to make lending decisions that\nbalance the needs of our customers and\nprospective customers with the interests of\nour other stakeholders, including investors,\ncommunities and employees. PNC recognizes that\nthese decisions must also take into account\nevolving environmental, social, human rights\nand reputational risk considerations. PNC's\nESRM framework \u2014 information about which is\npublished in our annual Corporate\nResponsibility Report \u2014 strives to capture\nthese nuances by embedding a deep commitment\nto stakeholder engagement in the risk\nmanagement process.

PNC also provided this\noverview to the co-filers directly. PNC has\nbeen and will continue to increase disclosure\naround its ESRM process.\n\nThe Board is regularly updated on the ESRM\nframework and as a result of shareholder\nfeedback commits to annually review PNC's ESRM\nframework to ensure: (i) that it continues to\nbe appropriate for PNC's expanding business,\nthe shifting risk landscape, and heightened\nenvironmental, social, human rights and\nreputational risk considerations; and (ii)\nthat it continues to appropriately balance the\nneeds of our customers and prospective\ncustomers with the interests of our other\nstakeholders, including investors, communities\nand employees. In 2021 and again in February\n2022, the Board undertook a special and\ndetailed review of PNC's financing\nrelationships with companies described by the\nco-filers as connected to the nuclear defense\nindustry. This covered, among other things,\nthe credit, legal, and reputational risks\npotentially inherent to these particular\nlending relationships. Following this review,\nthe Board concluded that PNC's relationships\nwith these companies are consistent with its\nESRM framework; and these companies do not\npose a material credit, legal or reputational\nrisk to PNC.\n\nFinally, in contrast to the co-filers'\nclassification of the companies in question as\n\"nuclear weapons companies,\" nuclear defense\nrepresents a small portion of their\noperations. For example, the co-filers have\nidentified the likes of Boeing, Lockheed\nMartin, General Dynamics and Jacobs\nEngineering Group as companies in the nuclear\nweapons industry. 16 Products and services\nprovided by the many companies the co-filers\ncharacterize as \"nuclear weapons companies\"\ninclude the manufacture of cybersecurity and\ninformation technology solutions; construction\nmanagement and critical infrastructure\ndevelopment; navigation and radar systems;\nenvironmental remediation and revitalization;\nsafe drinking water management; wastewater\ntreatment; medical isotopes, which are use in\ncancer detection and treatment; and commercial\naircraft, golf carts, snowmobiles, and\nhealthcare technology, among others. To\naccomplish all these things, these companies\ncollectively employ more than 945,000 people.\n\nAs a result, while we remain committed to\nengaging on this and other topics important to\nour stakeholders, the Board has determined:\n\n\u2022 PNC does not have a material impact on the\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons;\n\n\u2022 The companies in question have been\nthoroughly and appropriately vetted by PNC's\nESRM process;\n\n\u2022 PNC's ESRM systems effectively manage the\nrisks associated with PNC's loans to these\ncompanies; and\n\n\u2022 The Board has enhanced its risk oversight\nand will annually review PNC's ESRM framework.\n16\nhttps://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/nwproducers/\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2022                             87  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REPORT ON RISK\nMANAGEMENT AND THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS INDUSTRY\n(ITEM 4)\n                                              \n   GENERAL INFORMATION                        \n                                              \nWe will hold our annual meeting of\nshareholders on Wednesday, April 27, 2022.\nThis proxy statement includes information\nabout PNC, describes the proposals to be\nconsidered at the meeting and explains the\nvoting process.

Different proposals may have different\nvoting requirements for approval. This section\nprovides information regarding the vote\nrequired for approval of each proposal\npresented in the proxy statement and\nadditional details regarding the mechanics of\nproposal approval.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania law, if you abstain from\nvoting or fail to vote, your shares will not\nbe counted as votes cast on the proposal. To\nabstain, you must check the \u201cAbstain\u201d box on\nyour proxy card, or select the appropriate\noption when voting by Internet or telephone. A\nbroker non-vote is treated as a failure to\nvote. Therefore, if you do not provide\ninstructions to your broker or bank regarding\nhow to vote on a proposal that is a non-\nroutine item, your shares will not be counted\nas votes cast on that proposal. If you are a\nshareholder of record and you sign, date and\nreturn your proxy card but do not provide\nvoting instructions, or you submit your proxy\nby Internet or telephone and do not provide\nvoting instructions, we will vote your shares\nrepresented by that proxy as recommended by\nthe Board and those shares will be counted as\nvotes cast.\n\nElection of directors (Item 1). Under\nPennsylvania law, unless a company\u2019s articles\nof incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise,\ndirectors are elected by a plurality of the\nvotes cast. Our Bylaws include an eligibility\nrequirement for director nominees in\nuncontested elections, whereby an incumbent\ndirector will offer to resign from the Board\nif he or she does not receive a majority of\nthe votes cast. To receive a majority of the\nvotes cast, the shares voted \u201cfor\u201d a\ndirector\u2019s election must exceed 50% of the\ntotal number of shares voted with respect to\nthat director\u2019s election. Our Bylaws and\ncorporate governance guidelines describe this\nmajority voting requirement and the related\nprocedure in the event that a director must\ntender his or her resignation to the Board.\nThis is considered a non-routine item, so\nthere may be broker non-votes with respect to\nthis proposal. Broker non-votes and\nabstentions will not be included in the total\nvotes cast and will not affect the results of\nthe vote on this proposal.\n\nRatification of independent registered public\naccounting firm (Item 2). A majority of the\nvotes cast will be required to approve the\nratification of the Audit Committee\u2019s\nselection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor 2022 . This is considered a routine item,\nso brokers will have the discretion to vote\nuninstructed shares on behalf of beneficial\nowners with respect to this proposal.\nTherefore, broker non-votes are not expected\nto exist for this proposal, although a broker\nmay otherwise fail to submit a vote. Failures\nby brokers to vote and abstentions will not be\nincluded in the total votes cast and will not\naffect the results of the vote on this\nproposal.\n\n\u201cSay-on-pay\u201d: Advisory vote on executive\ncompensation (Item 3). A majority of the votes\ncast will be required to approve this item, an\nadvisory vote on the compensation of our named\nexecutive officers. Because your vote is\nadvisory, it will not be binding on the Board\nor PNC. This is considered a non-routine item,\nso there may be broker non-votes with respect\nto this proposal. Broker non-votes and\nabstentions will not be included in the total\nvotes cast and will not affect the results of\nthe vote on this proposal.\n\nShareholder proposal (Item 4). A majority of\nthe votes cast will be required to approve the\nshareholder proposal. This is considered a\nnon-routine item, so there may be broker non-\nvotes with respect to this proposal. Broker\nnon-votes and abstentions will not be included\nin the total votes cast and will not affect\nthe results of the vote on this proposal.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2022 Proxy                        91  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   GENERAL INFORMATION                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2023 ANNUAL   \n  MEETING                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  SEC Rule 14a-8.                             \n                                              \nIf you are a shareholder who would like us to\ninclude your proposal in the notice of our\n2023 annual meeting of shareholders and\nrelated proxy materials, you must comply with\nSEC Rule 14a-8, including with respect to\nsubmission of your proposal by the applicable\ndeadline.

Each shareholder\nwill be limited to one question.\n                                              \n  4.                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Responses to Questions; Time Limit          \n                                              \nQuestions from shareholders will be taken on a\nrotating basis.

Please keep questions brief in\norder to give us the opportunity to address as\nmany questions as possible.
