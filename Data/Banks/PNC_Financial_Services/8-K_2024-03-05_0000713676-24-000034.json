(the\n\u201cCorporation\u201d), discussed business performance\nand strategy at the RBC Capital Markets Global\nFinancial Institutions Conference in New York\nCity. This presentation was accompanied by a\nseries of electronic slides that included\ninformation pertaining to financial results\nand business strategies. A copy of these\nslides and related material is included in\nthis report as Exhibit 99.1 and is furnished\nherewith.\n                                              \n  Item 8.01. Other Events.                    \n                                              \nAs previously disclosed by the Corporation,\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC\u201d) invoked the systemic risk exception to\ncertain resolution-related and Deposit\nInsurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) restrictions\nfollowing the closures of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank in March 2023 to fully\nprotect all depositors of the affected\ninstitutions, including uninsured deposits. In\nNovember 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to\nimplement the special assessment, estimating\nthat the assessed losses to the DIF would\ntotal approximately $16.3 billion. Also as\npreviously disclosed, under the rule, the FDIC\nwill collect from the Corporation, along with\nother bank holding companies and insured\ndepository institutions, special assessments\nat an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis\npoints of an institution\u2019s uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022 (adjusted to\nexclude the first $5 billion), over eight\nquarterly assessment periods, beginning after\nthe first quarter of 2024. As a result, the\nCorporation estimated noninterest expense\nrelated to the special assessment to total\napproximately $515 million on a pre-tax basis\nand incurred this expense during the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\n\nBecause the losses to the DIF from the\nsystemic risk exception are estimated, the\nFDIC will periodically adjust the estimate,\nwhich could result in extending the special\nassessment for additional quarters, imposing a\nfinal special assessment on a one-time basis\nif actual losses exceed the amounts collected,\nor cease collection early if the FDIC has\ncollected enough to recover actual losses. In\nlate February 2024, subsequent to the filing\nof PNC\u2019s annual Form 10-K, the FDIC estimated\nthat the assessed losses will now total\napproximately $20.4 billion. The Corporation\nestimates that the additional noninterest\nexpense related to the revised special\nassessment will be approximately $130 million\non a pre-tax basis, which the Corporation\nexpects to incur during the first quarter of\n2024, and that the total noninterest expense\nwill be approximately $645 million on a pre-\ntax basis.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation\n\nThis Report contains forward-looking\nstatements regarding the Corporation\u2019s\nanticipated FDIC special assessment related to\nthe closures of Silicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank, and the associated impacts to\nexpense.
