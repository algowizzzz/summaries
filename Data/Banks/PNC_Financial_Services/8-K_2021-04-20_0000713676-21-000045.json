Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Report\nspeak only as of the date of this Report, and\nwe assume no duty, and do not undertake, to\nupdate them. Actual results or future events\ncould differ, possibly materially, from those\nthat we anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nForward-looking statements in this Report are\nsubject to the following risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransaction itself and to the integration of\nthe acquired business into PNC after closing:\n\n\u2022 The business of BBVA USA Holdco, including\nits U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA Bank,\nmay not perform as we currently project or in\na manner consistent with historical\nperformance. As a result, the anticipated\nbenefits, including estimated cost savings, of\nthe transaction may be significantly harder or\ntake longer to achieve than expected or may\nnot be achieved in their entirety as a result\nof unexpected factors or events, including\nthose that are outside of our control.\n\n\u2022 The combination of BBVA USA Holdco,\nincluding its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA\nUSA Bank, with that of PNC and PNC Bank may be\nmore difficult to achieve than anticipated or\nhave unanticipated adverse results relating to\nBBVA USA Holdco, including its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA Bank, or our existing\nbusinesses.\n\n\u2022 Completion of the transaction is dependent\non the satisfaction of customary closing\nconditions, which cannot be assured. The\ntiming of completion of the transaction is\ndependent on various factors that cannot be\npredicted with precision at this point.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are also\nsubject to the principal risks and\nuncertainties applicable to our businesses\ngenerally that are disclosed in our 2020 Form\n10-K and in our subsequent filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the\n\u201cSEC\u201d).
