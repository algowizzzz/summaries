All  \nother NEOs receive at least 50% of their total\ncompensation in the form of long-term equity- \nbased incentive awards. In addition to being  \nat-risk,these incentives are not payable for  \nseveral years.

Under   \u2502\n\u2502  PNC\u2019s governing documents, all directors  \u2502\n\u2502  are elected annually to serve             \u2502\n\u2502  aone-yearterm until the next annual       \u2502\n\u2502  meeting and until their\u00a0successors are    \u2502\n\u2502  elected and qualified. Our Bylaws         \u2502\n\u2502  contemplate a range in the size of the    \u2502\n\u2502  Board from five to 25 directors.For the   \u2502\n\u2502  2024 annual meeting, the Board has fixed  \u2502\n\u2502  the number of directors to be elected at  \u2502\n\u2502  12 and nominated each incumbent director  \u2502\n\u2502  to serve for anotherone-yearterm ending   \u2502\n\u2502  at next year\u2019s annual meeting. All        \u2502\n\u2502  nominees were previously elected to the   \u2502\n\u2502  Board by our shareholders at PNC\u2019s 2023   \u2502\n\u2502  annual meeting. Each of our nominees has  \u2502\n\u2502  consented to being named in this proxy    \u2502\n\u2502  statement and to serve if elected. The    \u2502\n\u2502  Board has no reason to believe that any   \u2502\n\u2502  nominee will be unavailable or unable to  \u2502\n\u2502  serve as a director. In the event that a  \u2502\n\u2502  nominee becomes unable to serve as a      \u2502\n\u2502  director, proxies will be voted for the   \u2502\n\u2502  election of such other person as the      \u2502\n\u2502  Board may designate as a nominee, unless  \u2502\n\u2502  the Board chooses to reduce the number    \u2502\n\u2502  of directors authorized to serve on the   \u2502\n\u2502  Board.Of our 12 director nominees, all    \u2502\n\u2502  12 have valuable senior leadership        \u2502\n\u2502  experience, 11 are independent, four are  \u2502\n\u2502  women and three bring racial or ethnic    \u2502\n\u2502  diversity to the Board.In this section,   \u2502\n\u2502  we provide the following information      \u2502\n\u2502  regarding each nominee:\u220eName and age (as  \u2502\n\u2502  of the date of the annual meeting, April  \u2502\n\u2502  24, 2024)\u220eThe year in which they first    \u2502\n\u2502  became a director of PNC\u220ePrincipal        \u2502\n\u2502  occupation and public company             \u2502\n\u2502  directorships over the past five years\u220eA  \u2502\n\u2502  brief discussion of the specific          \u2502\n\u2502  experience, qualifications, attributes    \u2502\n\u2502  or skills that led to the Board\u2019s         \u2502\n\u2502  conclusion that the individual should     \u2502\n\u2502  serve as a directorFor information about  \u2502\n\u2502  the Board\u2019s nomination process, see       \u2502\n\u2502  \u201cCorporate Governance\u2014Board               \u2502\n\u2502  committees\u2014Nominating and Governance      \u2502\n\u2502  Committee\u201d in this\u00a0proxy statement.Board  \u2502\n\u2502  composition and attributesThe slate of    \u2502\n\u2502  director nominees for the 2024 annual     \u2502\n\u2502  meeting was developed by the Board with   \u2502\n\u2502  the assistance of its Nominating and      \u2502\n\u2502  Governance Committee. The Board and its   \u2502\n\u2502  Nominating and Governance Committee       \u2502\n\u2502  consider Board composition holistically;  \u2502\n\u2502  their goal is to assure that the Board,   \u2502\n\u2502  as PNC\u2019s highest governing body, has the  \u2502\n\u2502  experience, qualities, attributes and     \u2502\n\u2502  skills needed to enable effective         \u2502\n\u2502  oversight of PNC and its strategic        \u2502\n\u2502  direction.Accordingly, our slate of       \u2502\n\u2502  director nominees includes senior         \u2502\n\u2502  leaders with substantial experience in    \u2502\n\u2502  technology, cybersecurity, financial      \u2502\n\u2502  services, regulatory affairs, risk        \u2502\n\u2502  management, operations and strategic      \u2502\n\u2502  planning, finance and accounting,         \u2502\n\u2502  marketing and branding, corporate         \u2502\n\u2502  responsibility matters, talent            \u2502\n\u2502  management and succession planning.We     \u2502\n\u2502  also recognize the value of a Board that  \u2502\n\u2502  is diverse in perspectives and            \u2502\n\u2502  experience. We understand that a diverse  \u2502\n\u2502  board helps us reach better decisions     \u2502\n\u2502  and achieve better outcomes for our       \u2502\n\u2502  employees, customers and communities.

Defining leadership roles As\none of its key responsibilities, the Board    \nmonitors and, as needed, updates its          \nleadership structure to promote robust        \nindependent oversight of PNC and an engaged   \nand effective board with complementary        \nqualities. The Board believes its leadership  \nstructure should be flexible enough to        \naccommodate different circumstances.          \nAccordingly, our governing documents permit   \nthe roles of Chair and CEO to be filled by the\nsame or different individuals, and the Board  \nhas not adopted a policy with respect to the  \nseparation of the Chair and CEO positions.    \nHowever, to maintain robust independent       \nleadership on the Board, our corporate        \ngovernance guidelines provide that the Board  \nshall appoint a Presiding Director to function\nas its lead independent director, and that the\nPresiding Director also shall serve as the    \nchair of the Nominating and Governance        \nCommittee. The Board reviews its leadership   \nstructure each yearand may choose a different \nleadership structure if circumstances should  \narise that lead the Board to conclude that a  \ndifferent leadership structure would enable   \nthe Board to manage PNC more effectively for  \nthe long-term interests of our shareholders.  \nThe Board determines whether to separate the  \nChair and CEO positions as necessary or       \nappropriate, in its judgment, including but   \nnot limited to when selecting a new CEO. The  \nBoard considers a range of factors, including:\n(i) the individuals serving in the roles of   \nCEO, Chair, and Presiding Director and their  \nrecord of leadership and performance in those \nroles; (ii) the composition of the Board;     \n(iii) PNC\u2019s operating and financial           \nperformance and strategic plans; (iv) any     \nrecent or anticipated changes in the CEO role;\n(v) the effectiveness of the processes and    \nstructures for Board interaction with and     \noversight of management; and (vi) the         \nimportance of maintaining a single voice in   \nleadership communications and Board oversight,\nboth internally and with shareholders and     \nother stakeholders. The Board believes the    \ninterests of our shareholders are best served \nat this time through the current combined     \nChair and CEO leadership structure, in        \nconjunction with a Presiding Director who has \nrobust oversight and leadership               \nresponsibilities. This structure provides the \nappropriate balance between a Chair and CEO   \nwith responsibilities for day-to-             \ndaymanagement, Board leadership and setting   \nlong-term strategy, and an empowered          \nindependent Presiding Director with well-     \ndefined responsibilities, such as facilitating\nthe Board\u2019s independent oversight of PNC,     \nconducting the CEO evaluation, promoting a    \nclear understanding and communication between \nmembers of senior management and the Board on \nstrategic issues such as management           \ndevelopment and succession planning, executive\ncompensation and company performance, and     \nengaging and communicating with shareholders  \nand other stakeholders as appropriate.        \n                                              \n  William S.

In between meetings, each   \ndirector is encouraged to raise with the      \nPresiding Director any topics or issues that  \nthe director believes should be discussed in  \nexecutive session. As chair of the Nominating \nand Governance Committee, the Presiding       \nDirector leads the annual self-evaluation     \nprocess for the Board and its committees and  \nsubcommittee and the annual evaluation of     \ndirector independence. The Nominating and     \nGovernance Committee also reviews, and the    \nPresiding Director as chair of the Committee  \nreports to the Board on, developments in      \ncorporate governance that may be relevant to  \nPNC. \u220e Regular executive sessions of          \nindependent directors To help sustain a board \nculture of robust independent oversight, the  \nagenda for each quarterly meeting of the Board\nincludes a regularly scheduled executive      \nsession of the independent directors. These   \nsessions provide dedicated time for the       \nindependent directors to engage in candid     \ndiscussions as a group. Pursuant to our       \ncorporate governance guidelines, Andrew T.    \nFeldstein, our Presiding Director, presides   \nover these executive sessions.                \n                                              \n  22    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE Board\u2019s role in risk     \noversight A strong risk culture that          \neffectively informs strategic decisions is    \ncentral to PNC\u2019s vision for long-term success \nas a large, complex financial institution. ERM\nFramework PNC\u2019s enterprise-wide risk          \ngovernance framework (the \u201cERM Framework\u201d)    \nguides the objectives and design of our risk  \nmanagement processes. The ERM Framework       \nconsists of the following seven core          \ncomponents that provide executive management  \nand the Board with an aggregate view of the   \nsignificant risks impacting the organization: \nrisk culture, enterprise strategy (including  \nrisk appetite, strategic planning, capital    \nplanning and stress testing), risk governance \nand oversight, risk identification, risk      \nassessments, risk controls and monitoring, and\nrisk aggregation and reporting.Because we seek\nto manage PNC for the long term, our ERM      \nFramework and risk appetite primarily address \nour longer term strategic risks as understood,\nanalyzed and quantified through all phases of \nthe economic cycle. However, a significant    \nfocus is also applied to specific risks, such \nas credit, operational, liquidity, market and \ninformation security risks, that could have a \nmaterial impact in the short or medium term.  \n                                              \n  The Board oversees our risk-taking          \n  activities,                                 \n  holds management accountable for adhering   \n  to the                                      \n  ERM Framework, and is responsible for       \n  exercising                                  \n  sound, independent judgment when assessing  \n  risk.                                       \n  The Board receives assistance in carrying   \n  out its                                     \n  duties by delegations of oversight          \n  responsibility                              \n  to its committees and subcommittee. For     \n  more                                        \n  information, see \u201c\u2014Board committees\u201d in     \n  this proxy                                  \n  statement.                                  \n                                              \nThe enterprise policies that form the core    \ncomponents of the ERM Framework are subject to\nreview and approval by the Board\u2019s Risk       \nCommittee at least annually. Additionally, the\nrisk management processes that are established\nfrom time to time under the ERM Framework to  \nidentify, assess, monitor and report the      \nCompany\u2019s risks are subject to the oversight  \nand approval of the Risk Committee or its     \nCompliance Subcommittee or, in the case of    \ntechnology-related risks, the Technology      \nCommittee. Enterprise risk management function\nIn addition to oversight of PNC\u2019s ERM         \nFramework, the Board\u2019s Risk Committee is      \ndirectly responsible for the selection,       \nappointment, compensation and oversight of    \nPNC\u2019s Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk      \nOfficer is the senior executive who is        \nresponsible for PNC\u2019s enterprise risk         \nmanagement function and leads PNC\u2019s internal  \nindependent risk organization (\u201cIndependent   \nRisk Organization\u201d), which is independent from\nPNC\u2019s lines of business .The Chief Risk       \nOfficer also chairs the Enterprise Risk       \nManagement Committee, which provides          \nexecutive-level oversight of risk management  \nand implementation of the Enterprise Risk     \nProfile across the lines of business, as well \nas emerging risk trends and issues. The Chief \nRisk Officer and PNC\u2019s Chief Compliance       \nOfficer, who reports up through the Chief Risk\nOfficer, provide regular reports to the Risk  \nCommittee (or the Compliance Subcommittee, as \napplicable) regarding the Company\u2019s risk      \nprofile; significant existing, new or emerging\nrisks; significant initiatives to identify,   \nmanage and control such risks; and the        \noperations of the risk management function.   \nPNC\u2019s Independent Risk Organization operates  \nthrough a multi-level risk committee          \nstructure, whose purpose is to enable         \noversight of business activities at a more    \ngranular level and ensure that policies       \ndefined by our ERM Framework are followed and \nthat business decisions are made and executed \nconsistent with the Board\u2019s desired risk      \nprofile. Based on the channels for information\nflow established under the Independent Risk   \nOrganization, the Chief Risk Officer and the  \nChief Compliance Officer are able to (i) keep \nthe Risk Committee and the Compliance         \nSubcommittee informed of the significant risks\nthe Company faces and management\u2019s assessment \nof how those risks affect the Enterprise Risk \nProfile and the risk appetite policy of the   \nERM Framework, and (ii) systematically        \ndisseminate feedback from the Risk Committee  \nand Compliance Subcommittee to the lines of   \nbusiness. Additionally, the Independent Risk  \nOrganization regularly engages external       \nparties, both formally and informally, to help\nensure emerging threats and trends are        \nidentified and considered in our ongoing risk \nidentification, assessment, monitoring and    \nreporting frameworks. Engagements with        \nexternal parties include memberships in       \nindustry trade groups, consultations with     \nindustry experts and formal engagements with  \nindependent consultants. As new or emerging   \nrisks are identified, PNC evaluates the       \ncomprehensiveness of our existing ERM         \nFramework to identify, assess, monitor and    \ncontrol those risks. Chair/CEO and Presiding  \nDirector engagement with risk management A    \ncritical feature of our leadership structure  \nand enterprise risk management function is the\nregular engagement of the Chair and Presiding \nDirector in the enterprise risk management    \nprocess. Mr. Demchak\u2019s membership on the      \nmanagement-level Enterprise Risk Management   \nCommittee and the membership of Messrs.       \nDemchak and Feldstein on the Board-level Risk \nCommittee facilitate ongoing engagement and   \nproficiency with the enterprise risk          \nmanagement process and the risks that are     \nescalated for discussion at those committees. \nWe believe this promotes an open line of      \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             23  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE communication between our\nChair and our Presiding Director on risk-     \nrelated issues and enables them to lead our   \nfull Board more productively in discussions,  \ndecision-making and strategy development.     \n                                              \n  For information about the Board\u2019s role in   \n  oversight of specific risks, including      \n  information                                 \n  security risk, climate risk and others,     \n  see                                         \n  \u201c\u2014Board committees\u201d in this proxy           \n  statement.                                  \n                                              \nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics PNC   \nhas adopted, and the Audit Committee has      \napproved, a Code of Business Conduct and      \nEthics that applies generally to all employees\nand directors.

Our adoption of the Code of        \nBusiness Conduct and Ethics is intended to    \nsatisfy the SEC\u2019s requirement to adopt a code \nthat applies to a company\u2019s CEO and senior    \nfinancial officers. The Audit Committee must  \napprove any waivers of or exceptions to code  \nprovisions granted to our directors or        \nexecutive officers. We will post on our       \nwebsite any future amendments to, or waivers  \nfrom, a provision of the Code of Business     \nConduct and Ethics that applies to any of our \ndirectors or executive officers (including our\nChairman and CEO, Chief Financial Officer     \n(\u201cCFO\u201d) and Controller). PNC has also adopted,\nand the Audit Committee has approved, Ethics  \nGuidelines for Directors to supplement the    \nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics. See      \n\"Director and Executive Officer               \nRelationships\u2014Code of Business Conduct and    \nEthics\" for more information. CEO and senior  \nexecutive succession planning Oversight of CEO\nand senior executive succession planning is a \ncore fiduciary responsibility of our Board. At\nthe direction of the Board, the Human         \nResources Committee has assumed responsibility\nfor overseeing and annually evaluating the    \nsuccession plans for the CEO, the CEO\u2019s direct\nreports and other key positions, except for   \nthe review and evaluation of the succession   \nplans for the General Auditor and Chief Risk  \nOfficer and their direct reports, which are   \nperformed by the Audit Committee and the Risk \nCommittee, respectively. Succession planning  \nencompasses both long-term succession         \nscenarios and contingencies or unplanned      \nscenarios. At least annually, the Human       \nResources Committee reviews a detailed        \nsuccession planning report from PNC\u2019s talent  \nmanagement function. The report typically     \nincludes a discussion of the individual       \nperformance of each executive officer, as well\nas succession plans and development           \ninitiatives for other emerging talent. Our CEO\nalso contributes his recommendations and      \nevaluations of potential successors and       \nguidance on the development plans for those   \nindividuals. The senior executive management  \nsuccession plan, including for the CEO, is    \nalso reviewed with the full Board from time to\ntime.                                         \n                                              \n  24    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE As part of the Board\u2019s   \ncommitment to continuing to strengthen and    \ndevelop PNC\u2019s senior leadership team, in      \nFebruary 2024 the Board unanimously voted to  \nappoint Michael P.

Shareholder engagement PNC \nhighly values engagement with our shareholders\nand other stakeholders and we maintain an     \nactive dialogue with them throughout the year.\nDuring 2023, we engaged with 210 unique firms \nrepresenting approximately 50% of the         \nownership of our outstanding common stock. We \nregularly engage with shareholders on a wide  \nvariety of topics such as strategy, financial \nand operating performance, corporate          \nresponsibility matters and corporate          \ngovernance, among others. These discussions   \nincluded participation from our investor      \nrelations team as well as our CEO and CFO,    \nline of business leaders, and technology,     \nrisk, corporate responsibility, corporate     \ngovernance and human resources teams.         \nManagement regularly reports to the           \nindependent directors regarding investor      \ndiscussions and feedback on topics of         \ninterest, enabling the Board to consider and  \naddress those matters effectively. Shareholder\nfeedback is taken into consideration and may  \nbe used to inform company practices and       \ndisclosures. Other corporate governance       \npractices Director orientation and education  \nAs an organization that delivers complex      \nproducts and services in a highly competitive \nand evolving environment, we believe that     \ncontinuing education plays an important role  \nin sustaining an effective board. Our         \ncorporate governance guidelines mandate a     \ndirector orientation and continuing education \nprogram, which is implemented as described    \nbelow.                                        \n                                              \n  Orientation            Continuing           \n                         Education            \n  All of our new                              \n  directors undergo a                         \n  director               Our continuing       \n  orientation            education program    \n  program, which         takes into account   \n  includes written       directors\u2019           \n  materials and          knowledge and        \n  personalized           experience and our   \n  orientation            risk profile, and    \n  sessions.              includes training    \n  Personalized           on complex products  \n  orientation            and services, our    \n  sessions               lines of business,   \n  generally include      significant risks    \n  meetings with          to the Company,      \n  members                applicable laws,     \n  of senior              regulations and      \n  management to          supervisory          \n  familiarize new        requirements, and    \n  directors with our     other relevant       \n  strategic plans,       topics, as           \n  significant            identified by the    \n  financial,             Board and senior     \n  accounting and         management. \u00a0 The    \n  risk management        continuing           \n  issues, capital        education program    \n  markets                is delivered         \n  activities,            through a            \n  compliance             combination of       \n  programs, the          personalized         \n  Code of Business       sessions and         \n  Conduct and Ethics     external seminars,   \n  and                    including those      \n  related policies,      offered by           \n  our principal          regulators, that     \n  officers, and our      are relevant to the  \n  internal and           duties of a          \n  independent            director.

Appropriate action plans are   \nthen developed to implement enhancements and  \nother changes based on the feedback received. \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             25  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE Majority vote standard in\ndirector elections PNC\u2019s Bylaws and corporate \ngovernance guidelines provide that, except in \na contested election, directors are elected by\na majority of the votes cast at the meeting.  \nThe term \u201ca majority of the votes cast\u201d means \nthat the number of shares voted \u201cfor\u201d the     \nmatter exceeded 50% of the total number of    \n\u201cfor\u201d and \u201cagainst\u201d votes cast with respect to\nthe same matter. Abstentions and broker non-  \nvotesare not counted as votes cast either     \n\u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst.\u201d A \u201ccontested election\u201d is \nany election of directors in which the number \nof candidates exceeds the number of directors \nto be elected at the meeting. If an incumbent \ndirector standing for re-electionfails to     \nreceive the requisite shareholder support at a\nmeeting, and a successor director is not      \nelected at the same meeting, our Bylaws and   \ncorporate governance guidelines require the   \nincumbent director to tender his or her       \nresignation to the Board. The Board then must \naccept or reject the tendered resignation,    \ntaking into account the recommendation of the \nNominating and Governance Committee, and must \npublicly disclose its decision and rationale  \nwithin 90 days after the date of certification\nof the election results. If the incumbent     \ndirector\u2019s resignation is not accepted by the \nBoard, he or she would continue to serve until\nthe next annual meeting and until his or her  \nsuccessor is duly elected, or until his or her\nearlier resignation or removal.

Because the Compliance     \n     Subcommittee is a subcommittee of the    \n     Risk Committee, proposed changes to its  \n     charter are subject to Risk Committee    \n     approval.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     The chairs and members of the            \n     committees and the subcommittee are      \n     appointed annually by the Board, based   \n     on the recommendations of the            \n  \u220e  Nominating and Governance Committee.     \n     The Board also may consult with the      \n     Risk Committee chair in determining the  \n     membership of the Compliance             \n     Subcommittee.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each committee and subcommittee except   \n     the Executive Committee has a regular    \n     meeting schedule, typically coordinated  \n  \u220e  with the quarterly Board meetings.       \n     Certain committees meet more often than  \n     once per quarter to accommodate the      \n     committee\u2019s areas of oversight.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     We maintain a systematic information     \n     flow from each committee and             \n     subcommittee to the full Board. At each  \n     quarterly meeting of the full Board,     \n  \u220e  each committee and subcommittee chair    \n     presents a report of the items           \n     discussed and actions approved at        \n     previous meetings of such committee or   \n     subcommittee .                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each committee and subcommittee has the  \n     authority to hire, at the expense of     \n  \u220e  PNC, independent legal, financial or     \n     other advisors as the committee and      \n     subcommittee may deem necessary,         \n     advisable or appropriate.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Except for the Risk Committee and the    \n     Executive Committee, each committee and  \n     subcommittee is composed entirely of     \n     directors who satisfy the relevant       \n     independence requirements under our      \n     corporate governance guidelines, the     \n  \u220e  NYSE corporate governance rules and, as  \n     applicable, SEC regulations. We believe  \n     the membership of Mr.\u00a0Demchak, our       \n     Chairman and CEO, on the Risk Committee  \n     and Executive Committee enables those    \n     committees to function more              \n     effectively.

Each year, the   \nHuman Resources Committee makes decisions     \nregarding the amount and form of annual       \ncompensation and equity-based or other longer-\nterm compensation for our executive officers, \nincluding our named executive officer         \n(\u201cNEOs\u201d), and certain other designated senior \nemployees. For the most part, these decisions \nare made in the first quarter of each year,   \nfollowing an evaluation of the prior year\u2019s   \nperformance. In addition to the summary below,\nsee \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d and\n\u201cCompensation Committee Report\u201d in this proxy \nstatement for more information about the      \nprocess for determining executive             \ncompensation. \u220e Information gathering and     \ndecision-making process. The Committee obtains\nassistance in its executive compensation      \ndeterminations from members of management and \nexternal compensation consultants. For        \nexample, the Committee relies on comparative  \ncompensation data, which may be prepared by or\non behalf of management based on proxy        \nstatements and other public disclosures, or   \nmay be provided by compensation consultants in\nthe form of surveys and reports. For the 2023 \nperformance year, the Committee\u2019s independent \ncompensation consultant, Meridian Compensation\nPartners, LLC (\u201cMeridian\u201d), prepared          \ndiscussion materials relating to the          \ncompensation of the CEO, which Meridian       \ndiscussed with the Committee in executive     \nsession. Meridian also prepared other         \nbenchmarking reviews and pay for performance  \nanalyses for the Committee with respect to the\nCEO, CFO, and other NEOs. At least one        \nrepresentative from Meridian attended all     \nmeetings of the Committee and met regularly   \nwith the Committee without members of         \nmanagement present. Before each Committee     \nmeeting, the Committee chair typically meets  \nwith members of management and the independent\ncompensation consultant to discuss the agenda,\nproposed meeting materials, and any areas of  \nfocus. The Committee Chair may schedule other \nmeetings with the Committee\u2019s independent     \ncompensation consultant without management    \npresent as needed. During Committee meetings, \nthe CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer \noften review corporate, business segment, and \nindividual executives\u2019 performance as part of \nthe compensation discussions, and may present \ntheir views or recommendations. The Committee \nevaluates these recommendations, generally in \nconsultation with the Committee\u2019s independent \ncompensation consultant. Other members of     \nexecutive management also may be invited to   \nprovide the Committee with more detailed      \ninformation about specific elements of        \nbusiness performance. For example, our Chief  \nRisk Officer regularly presents to the        \nCommittee on risk performance matters that are\nconsidered as part of executive compensation  \ndeterminations. The Committee considers       \ncompensation decisions for the CEO and the    \nChief Human Resources Officer in executive    \nsession, without either officer present for   \nthe discussion of their compensation. Any     \ndecisions on CEO compensation are also        \ndiscussed with the full Board in executive    \nsession. Role of compensation consultants. \u220e  \nIndependent compensation consultant. As       \nindicated above, the Committee retained       \nMeridian as its independent compensation      \nconsultant for 2023 to advise on PNC\u2019s        \ncompensation programs for its CEO and other   \nexecutive officers. In this capacity, Meridian\nreported directly to the Committee. PNC paid  \nno fees to Meridian in 2023 other than fees   \npaid in connection with the work performed by \nMeridian for the Committee. The Committee     \nevaluated whether the work of Meridian raised \nany conflicts of interest. The Committee      \nconsidered various factors, including the six \nfactors mandated by SEC regulations, and      \ndetermined that no conflict of interest was   \nraised by the work performed by Meridian for  \nthe Committee.                                \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             31  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \u220e Other consultants.     \nManagement also retains compensation          \nconsultants for its own use. In 2023,         \nmanagement retained McLagan to provide certain\nmarket data in the financial services         \nindustry. Management also engages Willis      \nTowers Watson, a global professional services \nfirm, to provide various actuarial and        \nmanagement consulting services from time to   \ntime, including:                              \n                                              \n     Preparing specific actuarial             \n  \u220e  calculations on values under our         \n     retirement plans                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  Preparing surveys of competitive pay     \n     practices                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Analyzing our director compensation      \n     packages and providing related reports   \n  \u220e  to management and the Nominating and     \n     Governance Committee, which is           \n     responsible for overseeing compensation  \n     for PNC\u2019s non-employee directors         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Providing insurance brokerage and        \n  \u220e  consulting services to mitigate certain  \n     property and casualty risks              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Providing guidance on certain aspects    \n  \u220e  of total rewards, talent management and  \n     other human resources initiatives        \n                                              \nReports prepared by Willis Towers Watson and  \nMcLagan that relate to executive compensation \nmay also be shared with the Human Resources   \nCommittee. Delegations of authority. The Human\nResources Committee has delegated authority to\nmanagement to make certain decisions or take  \ncertain actions with respect to compensation  \nor benefit plans or arrangements, other than  \nthose that are solely or predominantly for the\nbenefit of executive officers. \u220e Grants of    \nequity awards . For grants of equity or       \nequity-based awards, the Human Resources      \nCommittee has delegated to the CEO and the    \nChief Human Resources Officer (or the designee\nof either) the authority to make decisions    \nwith respect to equity grants for employees   \nwho are not designated by the Committee as    \nexecutives, including the determination of    \nparticipants and grant sizes, the allocation  \nof the pool from which a grant would be made, \nthe establishment and documentation of the    \nterms and conditions of such grants, the      \napproval of amendments to outstanding grants  \n(subject to any limitations set forth in the  \napplicable plan or the Committee\u2019s delegation \nof authority) and the exercise of any         \ndiscretionary authority provided to PNC or the\nCommittee pursuant to the terms of the        \noutstanding grants and the applicable plan.   \nThe Audit Committee and the Risk Committee (or\nin the case of equity-based grants, a         \nqualified subcommittee of the Risk Committee) \nhave the authority to award compensation under\napplicable plans to our General Auditor and   \nour Chief Risk Officer, respectively. Human   \ncapital strategy and succession planning. The \nHuman Resources Committee has responsibility  \nfor overseeing our programs, policies and     \npractices related to talent and human capital \nstrategy, the recruitment, development,       \nretention and advancement of talent, including\nas it relates to diverse talent, employee     \nengagement, health, safety and well-being, and\ncorporate culture. Unless reviewed or         \nevaluated by the full Board, the Committee is \nalso responsible for overseeing and annually  \nevaluating the succession plans for the CEO,  \nhis direct reports, and other key positions,  \nexcept for the succession planning for the    \nGeneral Auditor and Chief Risk Officer and    \ntheir related direct reports, which shall be  \nperformed by the Audit Committee and the Risk \nCommittee, respectively. Member               \nqualifications. The Human Resources Committee \nis composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe Committee\u2019s membership is intended to     \nsatisfy the independence standards established\nby applicable securities laws, as well as NYSE\ncorporate governance standards. When the Board\nmeets on April 24, 2024 to organize its       \ncommittees, only independent directors will be\nappointed to the Committee, including to the  \nposition of chair of the Committee.           \nCompensation committee interlocks and insider \nparticipation During 2023, the members of the \nHuman Resources Committee were Debra A.       \nCafaro, Andrew T. Feldstein, Richard J.       \nHarshman, Robert A. Niblock, Michael J. Ward  \n(until April 26, 2023) and Toni Townes-Whitley\n(until June 30, 2023). None of these directors\nwere officers or employees of PNC during 2023,\nnor are they former officers of PNC or any PNC\nsubsidiaries. During 2023, no executive       \nofficer of PNC served on the board of         \ndirectors or compensation committee (or other \nboard committee performing equivalent         \nfunctions) of an entity that had an executive \nofficer who served on the Board or the Human  \nResources Committee. Certain members of the   \nHuman Resources Committee, their immediate    \nfamily members or entities with which they are\naffiliated were our customers or had          \ntransactions with us (or our subsidiaries)    \nduring 2023. Transactions that involved loans \nor commitments by subsidiary banks were made  \nin the ordinary course of business on         \nsubstantially the same terms, including       \ninterest rates and collateral, as those       \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \ntransactions with other persons and did not   \ninvolve more than the normal risk of          \ncollectability or present other unfavorable   \nfeatures, and otherwise complied with         \nregulatory restrictions applicable to such    \ntransactions.

The Committee also assists the     \nBoard by identifying individuals qualified to \nbecome Board members. The Committee recommends\nto the Board the director nominees for each   \nannual meeting of shareholders, and may also  \nrecommend the appointment of qualified        \nindividuals as directors to fill any vacancies\nbetween annual meetings. The Committee also is\nresponsible for overseeing matters related to \nthe compensation of non-employeedirectors. The\nCommittee also oversees our engagement with   \nshareholders on corporate responsibility      \nmatters. Director nomination process . At     \nleast annually, the Nominating and Governance \nCommittee assesses the skills, qualifications \nand experience of our directors and recommends\na slate of director nominees to the Board for \nthe annual meeting. The Committee utilizes as \na discussion tool a matrix of certain skills  \nand experiences the Committee believes would  \nbe beneficial to have represented on the Board\nand its committees. The Committee considers   \nPNC\u2019s strategy and industry trends in         \ndeveloping a view of those skills and         \ncharacteristics that would benefit the Board. \nThe Committee is also focused on skills that  \nare required or beneficial for those serving  \nin key Board positions, such as committee     \nchairs, and considers succession planning for \nthose positions. The Committee leverages the  \nmatrix and considers the Board-approved       \nevaluation criteria and various regulatory    \nrequirements described below when identifying \npotential director candidates. The Committee  \nmay identify potential candidates through     \nrecommendations made by our current or former \ndirectors or members of executive management, \nor by contacts in the business, civic,        \nacademic, legal and non-profitcommunities, and\nthe Committee may retain a search firm to     \nidentify potential candidates.                \n                                              \n  Candidate recommendations from              \n  shareholders: The Nominating and            \n  Governance Committee also will consider     \n  director candidates recommended by our      \n  shareholders for nomination at the next     \n  year\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. For  \n  the Committee to consider a director        \n  candidate recommended by a shareholder,     \n  the shareholder must submit the             \n  recommendation in writing to the Corporate  \n  Secretary at our principal executive        \n  offices. The submission must include the    \n  information described under \u201cDirector       \n  Nomination Process\u201d in section\u00a03 of our     \n  corporate governance guidelines, which can  \n  be found in the \u201cGovernance Documents\u201d      \n  section of                                  \n  www.pnc.com/corporategovernance. To be      \n  considered for the 2025 annual meeting of   \n  shareholders, the submission must be        \n  received by November\u00a013, 2024. \u00a0 The        \n  Nominating and Governance Committee will    \n  evaluate director candidates recommended    \n  by a shareholder in the same manner as      \n  candidates identified by the Committee or   \n  recommended by others. The Committee will   \n  not consider any candidate with an obvious  \n  impediment to serving as one of our         \n  directors.                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will  \nmeet to review and discuss relevant available \ninformation regarding director candidates,    \nconsidering the Board-approved evaluation     \ncriteria, the candidate\u2019s contribution to the \ndiversity of the Board and PNC\u2019s evolving     \nstrategic needs. If the Committee decides not \nto recommend a candidate for nomination or    \nappointment, or for additional evaluation, no \nfurther action is taken, and in the case of a \nshareholder-recommended candidate, the        \nCorporate Secretary will communicate the      \ndecision to the shareholder. If the Nominating\nand Governance Committee decides to recommend \na director candidate to the Board as a nominee\nfor election at an annual meeting of          \nshareholders or for appointment by the Board, \nthe Committee chair will report that decision \nto the full Board. Following a discussion     \nregarding the recommendation, the full Board  \nwill vote on whether to nominate the candidate\nfor election or appoint the candidate to the  \nBoard, as applicable. Invitations to join the \nBoard are extended by the Chair and the       \nPresiding Director, jointly acting on behalf  \nof the Board.                                 \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             33  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE Shareholder nominations. \nShareholders who wish to nominate a director  \ncandidate directly at an annual meeting of    \nshareholders or nominate and include a        \ndirector candidate in our annual meeting proxy\nmaterials must do so in accordance with the   \nprocedures contained in our Bylaws as well as \nthe additional requirements of SEC Rule       \n14a-19,as applicable, as described in         \n\u201cShareholder Proposals for the 2025 Annual    \nMeeting\u201d under the headings, \u201cAdvance notice  \nprocedures\u201d and \u201cProxy access procedures      \n,\u201drespectively.

In  \nevaluating existing directors and new director\ncandidates, the Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee assesses the current needs of the   \nBoard and its committees and the              \nqualifications of the individual. The Board   \nmust possess a mix of qualities and skills    \nappropriate to address the various risks      \nfacing PNC. Accordingly, the Committee expects\ndirectors to be capable of acquiring a sound  \nunderstanding of our strategic vision, our mix\nof businesses and our approach to regulatory  \nrelations and risk management.

For\nexample, at least a majority of our directors \nmust be independent under NYSE standards. Our \ncorporate governance guidelines impose a more \nrigorous standard and require that a          \nsubstantial majority (at least two-thirds)of  \nour directors be independent. We require a    \nsufficient number of independent directors to \nsatisfy the membership needs of Board         \ncommittees that also require independence.    \nNon-employeedirector compensation. The        \nNominating and Governance Committee reviews   \nthe elements of non-employeedirector          \ncompensation annually and approves adjustments\nwhen warranted. To aid its determinations, the\nCommittee may utilize analyses and related    \nreports prepared by Willis Towers Watson, a   \nglobal professional services firm retained by \nmanagement to perform various consulting      \nservices. For more information about the      \nprocess for determining non-employeedirector  \ncompensation, see \u201cDirector Compensation\u201d in  \nthis proxy statement. Member qualifications.  \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee is    \ncomposed entirely of independent directors.   \nWhen the Board meets on April 24, 2024 to     \norganize its committees, only independent     \ndirectors will be appointed to the Nominating \nand Governance Committee.                     \n                                              \n  34    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE Risk Committee           \n                                              \n                         Other members: \u00a0     \n  Chair Martin           Marjorie Rodgers     \n  Pfinsgraff Held 9      Cheshire William S.  \n  Meetings               Demchak Andrew T.    \n  in 2023                Feldstein Daniel R.  \n                         Hesse Linda R.       \n                         Medler               \n                                              \nThe Risk Committee\u2019s purpose is to require and\noversee the establishment and implementation  \nof our enterprise-wide risk governance        \nframework, including related policies,        \nprocedures, activities and processes to       \nidentify, assess, monitor, manage and report  \nmaterial risks at PNC, except for accounting  \nand financial reporting risk exposures and    \nrelated reputational risks, which are the     \nresponsibility of the Audit Committee.

A material relationship between a   \ndirector and PNC can be deemed to exist as a  \nresult of a relationship between PNC and an   \norganization affiliated with the director.    \nMaterial relationships may include commercial,\nindustrial, banking, consulting, legal,       \naccounting, charitable and family             \nrelationships.

In the event a director has a   \nrelationship with PNC that is relevant to his \nor her independence and is not addressed by   \nthe bright-line independence tests under NYSE \nrules, the Board would determine, considering \nall relevant facts and circumstances, whether \nsuch relationship is material to the          \ndirector\u2019s ability to exercise independent    \njudgment as a member of our Board.

With the variety\nof products and services offered by PNC, some \nof our directors also may be PNC customers or \nhave other relationships with PNC that would  \nnot affect the director\u2019s independent         \njudgment. As an aid for assessing director    \nindependence, our Board has adopted guidelines\ndescribing four types of relationships that   \nwould not constitute a material relationship  \nbetween the director and PNC. If a            \nrelationship involving a director meets the   \ncriteria outlined in these guidelines, the    \ndirector may be deemed to be independent for  \nNYSE purposes, provided that the director     \notherwise meets the relevant independence     \ntests under NYSE rules. These guidelines are  \nincluded in our corporate governance          \nguidelines, which can be found in the         \n\u201cGovernance Documents\u201d section of our website \nat www.pnc.com/corporategovernance . The four \ncategories of relationships described in the  \ndirector independence guidelines include:     \n                                              \n     Ordinary course business relationships,  \n     such as lending, deposit, banking or     \n     other financial service relationships,   \n     or other relationships involving the     \n     provision of products or services by or  \n  \u220e  to PNC or its subsidiaries and           \n     involving a director, an immediate       \n     family member, or an affiliated entity   \n     of a director or immediate family        \n     member, where such relationships         \n     satisfy the criteria described in the    \n     guidelines                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Contributions made by PNC, its           \n     subsidiaries or a PNC-sponsored          \n     foundation to a charitable organization  \n  \u220e  of which a director or an immediate      \n     family member is an executive officer,   \n     director or trustee, subject to the      \n     conditions described in the guidelines   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Relationships involving a director\u2019s     \n  \u220e  relative who is not an immediate family  \n     member                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Relationships or transactions between    \n     PNC or its subsidiaries and a company    \n     or charitable organization where a       \n  \u220e  director or an immediate family member   \n     serves solely as a non-management board  \n     member or trustee or where an immediate  \n     family member is employed in a           \n     non-officer position                     \n                                              \nIn applying these guidelines, an \u201cimmediate   \nfamily member\u201d includes a person\u2019s spouse,    \nparents, children, siblings, mothers- and     \nfathers-in-law,sons- and daughters-in-        \nlaw,brothers- and sisters-in-law,and anyone   \n(other than domestic employees) who shares    \nsuch person\u2019s home. If a director has a       \nrelationship that would not be considered     \nmaterial under our director independence      \nguidelines but is one of the relationships    \ndescribed in the NYSE\u2019s bright-line           \nindependence tests, the NYSE rules govern and \nthe director will not qualify as independent. \nSee \u201c\u2014 Transactions with directors\u201d below for \na summary of the nonmaterial relationships    \nbetween current Board members and PNC that we \nidentified in 2023. Transactions with         \ndirectors The following is a summary of the   \nnonmaterial relationships between current     \nBoard members and PNC that we identified in   \n2023. Under our director independence         \nguidelines, the transactions below would not  \nimpair a director\u2019s independent judgment.     \nCustomer relationships. We provide financial  \nservices to most of our directors, some of    \ntheir immediate family members and certain of \ntheir respective affiliated entities. We offer\nthese services in the ordinary course of our  \nbusiness and provide the services on          \nsubstantially the same terms and conditions,  \nincluding price, as we provide to other       \nsimilarly situated customers. We also extend  \ncredit to some of our directors, their        \nimmediate family members and certain of their \nrespective affiliated entities.

The Code of Business     \nConduct and Ethics applies generally to all   \nemployees, including our executive officers,  \nand directors. Doing business with PNC. An    \nemployee or an immediate family member may    \nwant to engage in a business arrangement, such\nas the sale or lease of property or the       \nprovision of services, with PNC. For these    \ntransactions, we require prior approval from a\nsupervisor and our Corporate Ethics Office. If\na director desires to engage in a business    \narrangement with PNC, approval is required    \nfrom our Corporate Ethics Office and the      \nappropriate Board committee, as determined by \nour Presiding Director in accordance with our \nrelated person transactions policy, described \nin this proxy statement under \u201cRelated Person \nTransactions\u2014Related person transactions      \npolicy.\u201d Financial services to employees . Our\nemployees and their extended families are     \nencouraged to use PNC for their personal      \nfinancial services. These services must be    \nprovided on the same terms as are available to\nthe general public, all employees in a market \nor business, or all similarly situated        \nemployees. Transacting PNC business . We      \nrestrict directors and employees from         \ntransacting business on behalf of PNC with a  \nsupplier or customer in which the director,   \nemployee or an extended family member has a   \nsignificant personal or financial interest. We\nalso restrict directors and employees from    \ntransacting business on behalf of PNC with    \nrespect to their own accounts, extended family\nmember accounts or accounts for anyone whose  \nclose relationship may reasonably be viewed as\ncreating a conflict of interest. Our phrase   \n\u201cextended family member\u201d is similar to the    \nSEC\u2019s definition of \u201cimmediate                \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             41  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nDIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER RELATIONSHIPS  \nfamily member\u201d in Item 404(a) of Regulation   \nS-K.We have established procedures in certain \nof our businesses to permit employees to      \ntransact business with family members, subject\nto appropriate oversight and compliance with  \napplicable laws and regulations, including    \nRegulation O. Employing relatives . We may    \nemploy relatives of certain executive officers\nand directors, in some cases under            \ncircumstances that may constitute related     \nperson transactions under the SEC\u2019s Item      \n404(a) of Regulation S-K.See \u201c\u2014Family         \nrelationships\u201d below. In such cases, we track \nthe employment and compensation of relatives  \nof our executive officers and directors, and  \nwe have policies that restrict special        \ntreatment in the hiring or compensation of a  \nrelative of an executive officer or director. \nOur employment of a director\u2019s relative is    \nalso a factor in the determination of the     \ndirector\u2019s independence under NYSE rules and  \nour own guidelines regarding director         \nindependence. See \u201c\u2014Director independence\u201d    \nabove for a summary of the factors considered \nin determining director independence. Waivers \n. Employees may generally request waivers or  \nexceptions from certain provisions of the Code\nof Business Conduct and Ethics from our       \nCorporate Ethics Office. In the case of       \ndirectors and executive officers, any proposed\nwaiver or exception must be approved by both  \nour Corporate Ethics Office and the           \nappropriate Board committee. In 2023, no      \ndirectors or executive officers requested a   \nwaiver of any of the provisions described     \nabove. Ethics Guidelines for Directors . The  \nAudit Committee has adopted Ethics Guidelines \nfor Directors that contain comprehensive      \nguidance regarding the various PNC policies   \ngoverning the conduct of our directors. These \nguidelines are designed to supplement and     \nassist directors in understanding relevant    \npolicies, including our Code of Business      \nConduct and Ethics described above, our       \nRegulation O policies and procedures and our  \nrelated person transactions policy, each as   \ndescribed in more detail below, our Director  \nPre-Clearanceof Securities Policy and our     \nAnti-Corruption Policy. The Ethics Guidelines \nfor Directors were most recently approved on  \nAugust 8, 2023. Regulation O policies and     \nprocedures We maintain additional policies and\nprocedures to help ensure our compliance with \nRegulation O, which imposes various conditions\non a bank\u2019s extension of credit to directors, \nexecutive officers, and principal shareholders\nand related interests of the foregoing. Any   \nextensions of credit we make must comply with \nour Regulation O policies and procedures. Our \nRegulation O policies and procedures require  \nas follows:                                   \n                                              \n     Extensions of credit to covered          \n     individuals or entities must be made on  \n     substantially the same terms (including  \n     interest rates and collateral) as those  \n     prevailing at the time for comparable    \n  \u220e  transactions with those who\u00a0are not      \n     covered individuals or entities. For     \n     credit extensions under a benefit or     \n     compensatory program widely available    \n     to all employees, we may not give        \n     preference to any covered individual.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     The covered extension of credit must be  \n     made following credit underwriting       \n     procedures no less stringent than those  \n     prevailing at the time for comparable    \n  \u220e  transactions with non-covered            \n     individuals or entities. The extension   \n     of credit may not involve more than the  \n     normal risk of repayment or present      \n     other unfavorable features.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     The amount of covered extensions of      \n     credit may not exceed individual and     \n  \u220e  aggregate lending limits, depending on   \n     the identity of the borrower and the     \n     nature of the loan.                      \n                                              \nOur subsidiary bank, PNC Bank, National       \nAssociation (the \u201cBank\u201d), has a Regulation O  \nCredit Officer who reviews extensions of      \ncredit to Regulation O insiders to determine  \nour compliance with these policies. If an     \nextension of credit would result in an        \naggregate extension of credit of more than    \n$500,000, or an extension of credit is        \nproposed in connection with an insider whose  \naggregate extensions of credit already exceed \n$500,000, the Bank\u2019s board of directors must  \napprove it in advance. In addition, a director\nwho has received an extension of credit can   \nonly meet the independence requirements under \nour corporate governance guidelines if the    \ncredit complied with Regulation O at the time \nthe credit was extended. The Bank\u2019s board of  \ndirectors receives a report of all extensions \nof credit made to directors and executive     \nofficers and their related interests under    \nRegulation O. All loans to our directors and  \nexecutive officers and their related interests\noutstanding during 2023 complied with         \nRegulation O. Family relationships No family  \nrelationships exist among any of our directors\nor executive officers. PNC and its            \nsubsidiaries employ more than 56,000          \nemployees, and may have employees who are     \nrelated to an executive officer, director or  \ndirector nominee of PNC. Such employees       \nparticipate in compensation and incentive     \nplans or arrangements on the same basis as    \nother similarly situated employees. See \u201c\u2014Code\nof Business Conduct and Ethics\u201d above for     \ninformation about our policies and practices  \nwith respect to employment of relatives of    \nexecutive officers, directors and director    \nnominees of PNC. We describe below PNC\u2019s      \nemployment relationships with such \u201cimmediate \nfamily members,\u201d as defined by SEC            \nregulations, in cases where the family        \nmember\u2019s 2023 compensation exceeded $120,000. \nThese relationships were reviewed by our Audit\nCommittee in accordance with our related      \nperson transactions policy.                   \n                                              \n  42    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nDIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER RELATIONSHIPS  \n                                              \n     A brother-in-law of Gregory Jordan,      \n     General Counsel and Chief                \n     Administrative Officer, was employed by  \n     PNC in 2023 and had been for many years  \n  \u220e  before Mr.\u00a0Jordan joined PNC in 2013.    \n     He does not reside in the same           \n     household with Mr.\u00a0Jordan, is not an     \n     executive officer of PNC and does not    \n     report directly to an executive officer  \n     of PNC.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Two sons of Michael Hannon, Chief        \n     Credit Officer, were employed by PNC in  \n     2023.

The covered person may   \nhave incurred a liability as a result of      \nservice on our behalf or at our request. We   \nmay also advance the costs of certain claims  \nor proceedings on behalf of a covered person. \nIf we advance costs, the covered person agrees\nto repay us if it is determined that the      \nperson was not entitled to indemnification.   \nThe insurance policies we maintain for our    \ndirectors and executive officers also provide \ncoverage against certain liabilities. The     \nindemnification provisions, the advancement of\ncosts and our insurance coverage may provide  \nbenefits to our directors and executive       \nofficers. During 2023, we did not advance     \nlegal costs to any director or executive      \nofficer.                                      \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             43  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nRELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS Related person    \ntransactions policy A related person          \ntransaction is generally any transaction in   \nwhich (i) PNC or its subsidiaries is or will  \nbe a participant, (ii) the amount involved    \nexceeds $120,000 and (iii) a director or      \nnominee, executive officer, family member or  \nany beneficial owner of more than 5% of our   \ncommon stock has or will have a direct or     \nindirect material interest. Our policy for the\nreview and approval of related person         \ntransactions was most recently approved on    \nAugust 8, 2023. This policy provides a        \nframework for reviewing potential related     \nperson transactions and approving or ratifying\nrelated person transactions, under the        \ndirection of the Presiding Director. Under the\npolicy, the Presiding Director shall assign   \nresponsibility for reviewing the transaction  \nto the full Board, a Board committee solely   \ncomposed of independent directors, or such PNC\nofficers or management-level committee as the \nPresiding Director determines to be           \nappropriate. In general, a potential related  \nperson transaction that involves a director   \nwould be reviewed by the Nominating and       \nGovernance Committee, as the transaction could\nalso impact independence. A transaction that  \ninvolves an executive officer or beneficial   \nowner of more than 5% of our common stock     \nwould generally be reviewed by the Audit      \nCommittee. The full Board receives reports on \napproved, disapproved and ratified            \ntransactions. Under the policy, a related     \nperson transaction may be permitted only if   \nthe appropriate Board committee approves the  \ntransaction as not inconsistent with the      \ninterests of PNC and its shareholders and the \ntransaction is on terms comparable to those   \nthat could be obtained in arm\u2019s length        \ndealings with an unrelated third party.       \nCertain related person transactions Based on  \ninformation contained in a Schedule 13G/A     \nfiled with the SEC, BlackRock, Inc.           \n(\u201cBlackRock\u201d), through certain of its         \nsubsidiaries, indicated that it beneficially  \nowned more than 5% of our outstanding shares  \nof common stock as of December 31, 2023 (see  \n\u201cSecurity Ownership of Management and Certain \nBeneficial Owners\u2014Security ownership of       \ncertain beneficial owners\u201d in this proxy      \nstatement). In 2023, we purchased             \napproximately $8.6 million in products and    \nservices from BlackRock, including a central  \nprocessing system for enterprise investment   \nmanagement and related services, such as risk \nanalytics, portfolio management compliance and\noperational processing, and services          \nsupporting certain employee benefit plans.    \nThese transactions were entered into on an    \narm\u2019s length basis and contain customary terms\nand conditions. During 2023, we received      \napproximately $4.9 million in fees from       \nBlackRock for distribution and shareholder    \nservicing activities. These transactions were \nentered into on an arm\u2019s length basis and     \ncontain customary terms and conditions. We may\nin the ordinary course of business engage in  \ntransactions with BlackRock mutual funds,     \nincluding using the BlackRock funds as        \ntreasury management vehicles for our corporate\nclients, selling BlackRock investment products\nto our customers or placing our customer funds\nin BlackRock mutual funds, using BlackRock    \nfunds as an investment vehicle for the PNC    \n401(k) accounts, providing commercial loan    \nservicing to BlackRock funds or providing     \nshareholder services to our clients who are   \nshareholders of BlackRock mutual funds. We may\nalso make loans to BlackRock or the BlackRock \nfunds. These loans are made in the ordinary   \ncourse of business on substantially the same  \nterms, including interest rates and           \ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time   \nfor comparable loans with persons not related \nto PNC, and do not involve more than the      \nnormal risk of collectability. Based on       \ninformation contained in a Schedule 13G/A     \nfiled with the SEC, The Vanguard Group        \n(\u201cVanguard\u201d) indicated it beneficially owned  \nmore than 5% of our outstanding shares of     \ncommon stock as of December 31, 2023 (see     \n\u201cSecurity Ownership of Management and Certain \nBeneficial Owners\u2014Security ownership of       \ncertain beneficial owners\u201d in this proxy      \nstatement). In the ordinary course of business\nduring 2023, our Corporate & Institutional    \nBanking business provided treasury management \nservices and other banking services to        \nVanguard. These transactions were entered into\non an arm\u2019s length basis and contained        \ncustomary terms and conditions. PNC also      \nparticipates in two syndicated credit         \nfacilities to Vanguard and Vanguard-managed   \nfunds. These credit transactions were on      \nsubstantially the same terms, including       \ninterest rates and collateral, as those       \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \nfacilities with persons not related to PNC,   \nand did not involve more than the normal risk \nof collectability. In addition, our Asset     \nManagement Group and PNC Investments each     \ninclude Vanguard funds in their respective    \ninvestment platforms.                         \n                                              \n  44    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION PNC strives to provide  \nreasonable compensation that is commensurate, \nin both form and amount, with the duties of a \ndirector, in order to attract and retain the  \nhighest quality individuals to serve on the   \nBoard. In furtherance of this objective, each \nyear the Nominating and Governance Committee  \nof the Board reviews all elements of the non- \nemployeedirectors\u2019 annual compensation and    \napproves the form and amount of such          \ncompensation, with any such changes as        \ndetermined appropriate by the Committee. In   \naddition, from time to time, the Committee may\napprove special compensation to a director for\nextraordinary service. The primary objectives \nof the Committee\u2019s annual review are to       \nconfirm continued alignment with business and \nshareholder interests, evaluate our director  \ncompensation program relative to our peers,   \nand identify and respond to continued changes \nin director compensation in light of the      \ncompetitive environment. On April 26, 2023,   \nthe Committee approved various changes to the \nfees payable under PNC\u2019s annual compensation  \nprogram for non-employeedirectors, as outlined\nbelow. The changes were implemented during the\nApril 2023 to April 2024 term for director    \nservice. The changes were based in part on    \nmarket analyses prepared by Willis Towers     \nWatson (\u201cWTW\u201d), a global professional services\nfirm retained by management for various       \nconsulting services, including to advise on   \nthe non-employeedirector compensation program.\nWTW\u2019s market analyses examined the non-       \nemployeedirector compensation practices of the\nsame group of peer companies used by the Human\nResources Committee of the Board to benchmark \ncompensation (as identified in \u201cCompensation  \nDiscussion and Analysis\u2014Compensation policies \nand practices\u2014Peer group\u201d in this proxy       \nstatement). Prior to this update, the         \nCommittee most recently adjusted the fees     \npayable under the non-employeedirector        \ncompensation program in 2021. The Committee   \nbelieves the changes made in 2023 are         \nbeneficial to PNC because they simplify the   \nstructure of the non-employeedirector         \ncompensation program and help maintain non-   \nemployeedirectors\u2019 annual compensation within \na reasonable range of the market median level \nobserved in PNC\u2019s peer group.

Deferred\ncompensation plans. Our non-employeedirectors \nmay choose to defer the cash compensation they\nreceive (e.g., retainers) pursuant to the     \nDirectors Deferred Compensation Plan. Under   \nthis plan, the directors may elect to defer   \ncompensation into an account that tracks the  \nprice of PNC common stock or an interest rate \ndefined in the plan. The accounts that track  \nthe price of PNC common stock are credited    \nwith a number of units equal to the number of \nshares (including fractional shares) that     \ncould have been purchased with the equivalent \nof PNC common stock cash dividends that would \nhave been paid on such shares. We do not pay  \nabove-market or preferential earnings on any  \ndirector compensation that is deferred. The   \ndirectors may choose the payout date and      \nwhether the payout, which is made in cash,    \nwill be in a lump sum or up to 10 annual      \ninstallment payments. Under the Outside       \nDirectors Deferred Stock Unit Program, a      \nsubprogram of PNC\u2019s shareholder-approved 2016 \nIncentive Award Plan, each non-               \nemployeedirector is eligible to receive an    \nannual grant of DSUs that vest immediately    \nupon grant and are paid out in shares of PNC  \ncommon stock at retirement or death on a one- \nshareto one-DSUbasis. The number of DSUs      \ngranted is equal to the dollar value specified\nfor the award, divided by the closing price of\na share of PNC common stock on the date of    \ngrant, rounded down to the nearest whole      \nshare. The DSUs accrue dividends with         \nreinvestment equal to the number of DSUs that \ncould have been purchased with the equivalent \nof PNC common stock cash dividends (rounded   \ndown to the nearest whole share). DSUs have no\nvoting rights. The aggregate number of DSUs   \nand units that track the price of PNC common  \nstock held by each incumbent director pursuant\nto these deferred compensation plans is       \nincluded in \u201cSecurity ownership of management \nand certain beneficial owners\u201d in this proxy  \nstatement under the columns \u201cCommon Stock     \nUnits\u201d and \"Cash-Payable Common Stock Unit    \nOwnership.\" All such units are vested.        \n                                              \n  46    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION Other benefits. We      \ngenerally limit the benefits we provide to    \nnon-employeedirectors, but we regularly       \nprovide the following:                        \n                                              \n     Charitable matching gifts. We will       \n  \u220e  match a non-employee director\u2019s          \n     personal gifts to qualifying charities   \n     up to a limit of $5,000 per year.        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Insurance policies. We pay for various   \n     insurance policies that protect          \n  \u220e  non-employee directors and their         \n     families from personal loss connected    \n     with Board service.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Expenses related to Board service. We    \n     pay for expenses connected with our      \n  \u220e  non-employee directors\u2019 Board service,   \n     including travel on corporate, private   \n     or commercial aircraft, lodging, meals   \n     and incidentals.                         \n                                              \nWe may also provide other incidental benefits \nto our non-employeedirectors from time to     \ntime, including tickets to cultural, social,  \nsporting or other events and small gifts for  \nholidays, birthdays or special occasions. In  \nlimited circumstances, we may provide travel  \non corporate aircraft for personal purposes,  \nsuch as when a family emergency arises or a   \nseat is available on a previously scheduled   \nflight. We determine the value of these       \nbenefits based on the incremental cost to PNC \nand we include the amount in the \u201cAll Other   \nCompensation\u201d column of the Non-              \nemployeedirector compensation in 2023 table   \nbelow. Director stock ownership requirement.  \nThe Board has adopted a common stock ownership\nguideline for our non-employeedirectors. Under\nthis guideline, each non-employeedirector must\nown shares of PNC common stock (including     \nphantom stock units issued pursuant to the    \nDirectors Deferred Compensation Plan) with a  \nvalue of at least five times the value of his \nor her annual base retainer. Until a director \nmeets this ownership level, he or she must    \npurchase or acquire common stock or stock     \nunits that equal at least 25% of the annual   \nretainer for that year. Directors are expected\nto satisfy the stock ownership requirement by \nmaking open market purchases or by deferring  \ntheir cash retainers into stock units under   \nthe Directors Deferred Compensation Plan as   \ndescribed above. As of December 31, 2023, the \nminimum ownership threshold for non-          \nemployeedirectors was valued at $525,000,     \nreflecting the increased Board retainer amount\napproved in April 2023. All of our directors  \nserving at that time, other than Bryan S.     \nSalesky, who was appointed in October 2021,   \nand Renu Khator, who was appointed in May     \n2022, satisfied the minimum ownership         \nthreshold. Director compensation in 2023 The  \ntable below shows the compensation we provided\nto our non-employeedirectors for their service\nin 2023.

PNC demonstrated strength and\nstability by growing the customer base,       \ndeepening relationships across the coast-to-  \ncoastfranchise, adding to the loan portfolio  \nand managing the balance sheet for long-term  \nsuccess. PNC generated record revenue and     \ncontrolled core expenses, delivering positive \nadjusted operating leverage (growing revenue  \nfaster than expenses). Throughout the year,   \nPNC maintained strong credit quality metrics  \nas well as a strong capital and liquidity     \nposition. For the full year 2023, PNC returned\n$3.1 billion of capital to shareholders       \nthrough common stock dividends and share      \nrepurchases.

The Committee  \nuses the following principles to help guide   \nits executive compensation decisions:         \nCompensation principles                       \n                                              \n                        Provide appropriate   \n  \u220e\u2002\u200aPay for            compensation for      \n  performance:          demonstrated          \n                        performance across    \n                        the enterprise        \n                        Align executive       \n                        compensation with     \n  \u220e\u2002\u200aCreate value:      long-term             \n                        shareholder value     \n                        creation              \n                        Provide competitive   \n                        compensation          \n                        opportunities to      \n  \u220e\u2002\u200aManage talent:     attract, retain and   \n                        motivate              \n                        high-quality          \n                        executives            \n                        Encourage focus on    \n  \u220e\u2002\u200aDiscourage         the long-term         \n  excessive             success of PNC and    \n  risk-taking:          discourage excessive  \n                        risk-taking           \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the successful    \napplication of these principles requires a    \nthoughtful program design, which includes a   \nbalanced evaluation of performance. The       \nCommittee believes that discretion,           \nflexibility and judgment are critical to its  \nability to award incentive compensation that  \nreflects near-term performance results and    \nprogress toward longer-term strategic         \npriorities that allow PNC to create value for \nour shareholders. See \u201c\u2014Evaluating            \nperformance\u201d below for more information on how\nthe Committee evaluates performance. Key      \nprogram features The Committee reviews and    \napproves the compensation to be paid to our   \nNEOs. We seek clarity and transparency in our \ncompensation structure, using features that we\nbelieve will help to create a balanced        \nprogram. While we consider the expectations of\nvarious stakeholders, we want our compensation\nprogram to achieve multiple objectives,       \nconsistent with our compensation principles.  \nThe Committee also regularly reviews the      \noperation of our compensation program to help \nensure that our objectives continue to be met.\nTaken as a whole, our executive compensation  \nprogram includes several complementary, risk- \nmitigating features:                          \n                                              \n     We provide incentives for performance    \n  \u220e  over different time horizons (short-     \n     and long-term).                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     We embed performance goals into a        \n     significant portion of our long-term     \n  \u220e  incentives and include a risk-based      \n     performance review that could reduce or  \n     eliminate the awards.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     We reward achievement against both       \n  \u220e  quantitative and qualitative

The Federal Reserve, the OCC and     \nother financial industry regulatory entities, \nincluding the SEC, may provide guidance       \nperiodically on compensation matters.         \n                                              \n  54    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Total    \ncompensation framework To help achieve our    \ncompensation objectives, we evaluate our      \nexecutive pay program and make pay decisions  \nusing a total compensation framework, similar \nto many of our peers.                         \n                                              \n     Each NEO has a total compensation        \n  \u220e  target for the year that consists of     \n     (1)\u00a0a base salary and (2)\u00a0an incentive   \n     compensation target amount.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Committee generally sets these       \n     total compensation targets in the first  \n  \u220e  quarter of the year or when an           \n     executive joins PNC or assumes new       \n     responsibilities.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     The incentive compensation target is     \n     composed of annual cash and long-term    \n     equity-based awards, and the Committee   \n  \u220e  establishes a specific minimum           \n     percentage of compensation that will be  \n     delivered through long-term              \n     equity-based awards.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Under our program, the CEO receives at   \n     least 70% of total compensation (i.e.,   \n     base salary and incentive compensation)  \n     in the form of long-term equity-based    \n  \u220e  incentive awards, as illustrated below.  \n     All other NEOs receive at least 50% of   \n     total compensation in the form of        \n     long-term equity-based incentive         \n     awards.                                  \n                                              \nOnce the Committee sets the total compensation\ntarget, base salary, the only fixed source of \ncash compensation, is paid during the         \nperformance year. After year-end,what remains \nto be awarded within the total compensation   \nframework is variable incentive compensation \u2014\nthe annual cash incentive award and the long- \nterm equity-based incentive award. These      \namounts are evaluated and approved by the     \nCommittee during the first quarter of the     \nfollowing year, as discussed in more detail in\n\u201c\u20142023 performance and compensation           \ndecisions\u20142023 compensation decisions\u201d below. \nTotal incentive compensation evaluated        \ntogether. Under PNC\u2019s total compensation      \nframework, short-term and long-term incentive \nawards are evaluated together, not as separate\nprograms. This means that once the total      \ncompensation target is set each year, any     \nsubsequent adjustments to the target must run \nthrough the total compensation framework again\n(with no change to the base salary initially  \nset by the Committee in the first quarter).   \nGiven this structure, the Committee cannot    \nadjust the annual cash incentive element or   \nthe long-term incentive element without also  \nadjusting the other elements. For example, if \nthe Committee determines that an above-target \nperformance adjustment is appropriate for a   \ngiven year, that adjustment will then apply to\nthe full total compensation target. The       \nCommittee may, however, increase the          \npercentage of long-term incentive award within\nthe overall pay mix (e.g., the Committee may  \nshift a 50% cash compensation and 50% long-   \nterm incentive mix to a 40% cash compensation \nand 60% long-term incentive mix, where \u201ccash  \ncompensation\u201d refers to both base salary and  \nannual cash incentive.) Setting total         \ncompensation targets As discussed above, each \nNEO has a total compensation target for the   \nyear that consists of a base salary and an    \nincentive compensation target (composed of    \nannual cash and long-term equity-based awards)\nwhich the Committee sets during the first     \nquarter of the year or when an executive joins\nPNC or assumes new responsibilities. The      \nCommittee believes the total compensation     \ntargets collectively provide an appropriate   \nbalance between fixed and variable amounts,   \nmeasuring short-term and long-term            \nperformance, immediate and deferred payouts,  \nand cash and equity-based awards. For         \ninformation on how the Committee\u2019s 2023       \nincentive compensation decisions compared to  \nthe targets for the 2023 performance year, see\n\u201c\u20142023 performance and compensation           \ndecisions\u20142023 compensation decisions.\u201d When  \nconstructing an appropriate total compensation\ntarget for an NEO, the Committee uses         \nguidelines consistent with our compensation   \nprinciples: \u220e We set targets using several    \nfactors, including market data. The Committee \nreviews available market data but does not use\na formula to set an executive\u2019s target        \ncompensation. The Committee evaluates many    \nfactors, including the appropriateness of the \njob match and market data, the                \nresponsibilities of the position and the      \nexecutive\u2019s demonstrated performance, skills  \nand experience.                               \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             55  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \u220e At     \nleast 50% of compensation is equity-based and \nnot payable for several years. The Committee  \nbelieves that a significant portion of        \ncompensation should be at risk, tied to PNC   \nstock performance and not payable for several \nyears. Accordingly, at the beginning of the   \nperformance year, the Committee establishes a \nspecific minimum percentage of each           \nexecutive\u2019s total compensation that will be   \ndelivered through long-term equity-based      \nawards. For 2023, the Committee established   \nminimum equity percentages for each NEO       \nranging from 50% to 70%. The specific mix of  \ncash and equity for each NEO is discussed in  \nmore detail in \u201c\u20142023 compensation decisions.\u201d\n\u220e We split the equity-based incentive between \ntwo forms of awards. Each NEO who receives a  \nlong-term equity-based incentive award        \ngenerally receives the award in two primary   \nforms, a Performance Share Unit (\u201cPSU\u201d)       \nrepresenting 60% of the value of the long-term\naward, and a Restricted Share Unit (\u201cRSU\u201d)    \nrepresenting 40% of the value. Payouts under  \nthese awards are deferred over multiple years.\nFor information on the terms of these awards, \nsee \u201c\u2014Our compensation program\u2014Incentive      \ncompensation program.\u201d Evaluating performance \nIn the first quarter of each year, the        \nCommittee evaluates performance for the prior \nyear to (1) determine the prior year\u2019s total  \nincentive compensation awards and (2) set the \ntotal compensation target for the current     \nyear. The Committee believes that an effective\nexecutive compensation program requires a     \ncomprehensive evaluation of performance across\nmultiple categories. This evaluation generally\nincludes a review of financial performance,   \nhow we executed against our strategic         \nobjectives and how we manage risk, customer   \nexperience, talent management and leadership. \nIn determining the amount of incentive awards \nagainst the incentive compensation targets,   \nthe Committee may consider these performance  \nmetrics without assigning a specific weight or\nformula to any one metric. The Committee has  \nnot adopted a formula-driven compensation     \nprogram, believing that formulas may reward   \nshort-term results or behaviors that do not   \nserve the long-term interests of our          \nshareholders. Metrics that rely solely on     \nformulas may also be inappropriately skewed by\nresults outside of management\u2019s control.      \nFinally, formulas may undervalue important    \nstrategic objectives that do not translate to \neasily or immediately quantifiable metrics. As\na result, the Committee evaluates a variety of\nquantitative and qualitative metrics to attain\na comprehensive understanding of PNC\u2019s overall\nperformance. To the extent possible, the      \nperformance metrics reviewed by the Committee \nalign the objectives of our management,       \nshareholders and federal banking regulators.  \nIn some cases, these stakeholders have        \ndifferent objectives that cannot be easily    \nreconciled \u2014 for example, shareholders seeking\nhigher returns may be willing to tolerate more\nrisk than a federal banking regulator would   \naccept. That is another reason we rely on     \nmultiple metrics, representing performance    \nagainst a range of goals, and include the     \nability to make significant adjustments for   \nrisk management performance. Committee        \nevaluates performance quarterly. The CEO      \nreviews PNC\u2019s quarterly and annual performance\nwith the Committee. During these quarterly    \nreviews, the Committee receives a report on   \nthe following metrics, with comparisons to the\nprior year\u2019s results, the current year\u2019s      \nbudget or peer performance results, as        \nappropriate:                                  \n                                              \n  Category of                  Metrics        \n  Metric                       Evaluated      \n  Financial                    Net interest   \n  Performance                  income         \n                Noninterest                   \n                income*                       \n                EPS growth*                   \n  (measured                                   \n  against                                     \n  prior year,                  Return on      \n  current year                 assets*        \n  budget and                                  \n  peer group)                                 \n                Return on                     \n                equity*                       \n                Risk-adjusted                 \n                efficiency                    \n                ratio*                        \n  Capital,                                    \n  Risk and                     Tangible book  \n  Expense                      value          \n  Management                                  \n                CET1 ratio                    \n                Loans to                      \n                deposits                      \n                ratio                         \n  (measured                                   \n  against                      Net            \n  prior year                   charge-offs    \n  and to the                   to average     \n  extent                       loans          \n  available,                                  \n  peer group)                                 \n                Allowance for                 \n                loan and                      \n                lease losses                  \n                to total                      \n                loans                         \n                Noninterest                   \n                expense*                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  56    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \n                                              \n  Category of                  Metrics        \n  Metric                       Evaluated      \n  Business                     Average loan   \n  Growth                       balances       \n                Allowance for                 \n                loan and                      \n                lease losses                  \n                Average                       \n                interest-bea\u2026                 \n                deposits                      \n  (measured                                   \n  against                                     \n  prior year,                                 \n  current year                 Average        \n  budget and                   noninterest-\u2026  \n  to the                       deposits       \n  extent                                      \n  available,                                  \n  peer group)                                 \n                Average total                 \n                deposits                      \n                Average                       \n                noninterest-\u2026                 \n                deposits mix                  \n                Assets under                  \n                administrati\u2026                 \n                Mortgage                      \n                origination                   \n                value                         \n  Total                                       \n  Shareholder                                 \n  Return                                      \n  (\u201cTSR\u201d)                                     \n                One-year                      \n  (measured                                   \n  against peer                                \n  group and                    Three-year     \n  the                                         \n  S&P banking                                 \n  index)                                      \n                Five-year                     \n                                              \n* As adjusted We also adjust some of these    \nmetrics for certain events as described in    \nmore detail in the \u201c\u20142023 performance and     \ncompensation decisions\u20142023 compensation      \ndecisions\u201d section. Evaluating risk           \nperformance, talent management and succession \nplanning. In addition to these metrics, the   \nCommittee meets with the Chief Risk Officer on\na quarterly basis to review and discuss risk  \nperformance. The Committee also conducts      \nquarterly reviews of talent trends throughout \nour workforce as well as workforce            \nrepresentation. In addition, as part of its   \nBoard-delegated duties, the Committee is      \nresponsible for regularly discussing          \nsuccession planning and overseeing and        \nevaluating succession plans for PNC\u2019s senior  \nexecutive management (other than the Chief    \nRisk Officer, the General Auditor and their   \ndirect reports, which are handled by the Risk \nand Audit Committees respectively). Senior    \nexecutives are accountable for succession     \nplans in their respective lines of business   \nand for supporting the development of all     \npotential successors, and this is taken into  \nconsideration by the Committee in evaluating  \nperformance. Incentive compensation program   \nDetermination of incentive compensation       \nlevels.The incentive compensation target      \nawarded by the Committee includes two         \ncomponents: (1) an annual incentive award     \npayable in cash and (2) a long-term incentive \naward that is equity-based and granted in two \ndifferent forms (PSUs and RSUs). Step 1: After\nthe performance year ends, the Committee      \nevaluates PNC\u2019s aggregate performance for the \nyear, as well as the individual performance of\neach NEO, and determines an incentive         \ncompensation amount to be awarded to each     \nexecutive, expressed as a percentage of the   \ntotal compensation target set at the beginning\nof the performance year. Step 2: Once the     \nCommittee determines the final incentive      \ncompensation amount, it is divided between the\nannual cash incentive and the long-term       \nequity-based incentive. The long-term         \nincentive award makes up at least 50% of the  \nvalue of the total compensation awarded to the\nNEO. The Committee\u2019s evaluation of 2023       \nperformance and the related compensation      \ndecisions made by the Committee for each NEO  \nare described in the \u201c\u20142023 performance and   \ncompensation decisions\u20142023 compensation      \ndecisions\u201d section. Long-term incentive awards\n(equity-based). The long-term incentive is    \nequity-based and granted through two separate \nawards \u2014 PSUs and RSUs. The Committee made    \nthese grants to NEOs in the first quarter of  \n2024 (for 2023 performance) and in the first  \nquarter of 2023 (for 2022 performance). These \nawards, and all other equity-based awards, are\nmade under PNC\u2019s shareholder-approved 2016    \nIncentive Award Plan.                         \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             57  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The table\nbelow summarizes the material terms and       \nconditions of the awards granted in 2024 for  \n2023 performance (these material terms and    \nconditions are the same as the awards granted \nin 2023 for 2022 performance):                \n                                              \n           %\u00a0                    Pay\u2026         \n  N\u2026       of\u00a0                   Ran\u2026    St\u2026  \n  of       Lo\u2026    Ves\u2026    Me\u2026    (%      or   \n  A\u2026       Te\u2026    Sch\u2026           of      Ca\u2026  \n           In\u2026                   Tar\u2026    Pa\u2026  \n           Va\u2026                                \n                          PN\u2026                 \n                          re\u2026                 \n                          on                  \n                  Aft\u2026    eq\u2026                 \n                  thr\u2026    (R\u2026                 \n  P\u2026       60%    per\u2026    as     0\u20131\u2026    St\u2026  \n                  per\u2026    ad\u2026                 \n                  ends    co\u2026                 \n                          to                  \n                          pe\u2026                 \n                          ta\u2026                 \n      EPS                                     \n      gr\u2026                                     \n      as                                      \n      ad\u2026                                     \n      ra\u2026                                     \n      ag\u2026                                     \n      our                                     \n      pe\u2026                                     \n      gr\u2026                                     \n                  Ann\u2026                        \n                  ins\u2026                        \n  R\u2026       40%    over    Ti\u2026    0\u20131\u2026    St\u2026  \n                  thr\u2026                        \n                  yea\u2026                        \n                                              \nPSUs. With respect to 2023 performance, in the\nfirst quarter of 2024 the Committee granted to\ncertain of our senior executives, including   \nall NEOs, PSUs that represent an opportunity  \nto receive shares of PNC common stock. The    \npayout is based on how PNC performs against   \ntwo corporate performance metrics over a      \nthree-year performance period. Performance    \nagainst these two metrics generates a         \npercentage (the corporate performance factor).\nThe award may be decreased if PNC fails to    \nsatisfy a risk performance metric or based on \na discretionary risk performance review       \nconducted by the Committee. After applying any\nrisk-related performance adjustment (and if   \nPNC satisfies the risk performance metric),   \nthe resulting percentage is applied to the    \nnumber of target PSUs to determine the final  \nnumber of units available for settlement. The \nPSUs have a maximum payout opportunity of 150%\nof target. Payout of any award under the PSUs \nalso requires the satisfaction of service     \nrequirements and other award conditions. Two  \ncorporate performance metrics. The two        \ncorporate performance metrics include an      \nabsolute metric (an internal PNC measurement  \nagainst a target) and a relative metric (PNC  \nperformance against our peer group). The      \nabsolute metric is PNC\u2019s three-year average   \nreturn on equity (\u201cROE\u201d), as adjusted,        \ncompared to three-year ROE performance targets\nestablished in advance by the Committee. The  \nrelative metric is PNC\u2019s three-year average   \nEPS growth, as adjusted, compared to the      \nthree-year average EPS growth of our peer     \ngroup.                                        \n                                              \n      Absolute metric \u2013 3-year average ROE    \n      (as adjusted). We adjust ROE for the    \n      items described in the paragraphs       \n      following the table below. The ROE      \n      metric, as adjusted, will be            \n      calculated annually for each year of    \n      the performance period. At the end of   \n      the three-year performance period,      \n  1.  average ROE for the performance period  \n      will be determined as the average of    \n      PNC\u2019s annual ROE for each year. In      \n      establishing the ROE performance        \n      targets, the Committee considers        \n      multiple factors, including our         \n      historical performance, budget and      \n      future growth expectations, peer group  \n      results, cost of capital and analyst    \n      expectations.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      Relative metric \u2013 3-year average EPS    \n      growth (as adjusted). The EPS growth    \n      metric, as adjusted, will be            \n      calculated for each year of the         \n      performance period. At the end of the   \n  2.  three-year performance period, the      \n      annual EPS growth percentages will be   \n      averaged. PNC\u2019s three-year average EPS  \n      growth will be compared to the          \n      three-year average of each member of    \n      our peer group to determine our         \n      percentile rank.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      Determining corporate performance       \n      factor. Once PNC\u2019s percentile rank      \n      relating to average EPS growth, as      \n      adjusted, and PNC\u2019s average ROE, as     \n  3.  adjusted, are determined for purposes   \n      of the grants, the corporate            \n      performance factor, ranging from        \n      0\u2013150%, will be calculated using the    \n      grid below and applying bilinear        \n      interpolation.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  58    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The chart\nbelow shows the corporate performance metrics \nfor the 2024 PSU grants (the corporate        \nperformance metrics for the 2023 grants were  \ndisclosed in last year\u2019s proxy statement). For\nthe 2024 PSU grants, the Committee maintained \nthe same three-year average ROE maximum level \nof 13.0% and the threshold level of 8.00% as  \nthe prior year PSU awards, while adjusting the\ntarget level based on the overall economic    \nenvironment and PNC\u2019s risk appetite. In       \napproving the grid, the Committee also        \nconsiders an analysis of PNC\u2019s cost of capital\nand a multi-year pro forma analysis of ROE.   \n                                              \n      20\u2026                 Th\u2026                 \n      PSU                 av\u2026                 \n      Aw\u2026                 EPS                 \n      (2\u2026                 gr\u2026                 \n      Pe\u2026                 as                  \n      Pe\u2026                 ad\u2026                 \n                          (r\u2026                 \n                     PNC                 PNC  \n                     pe\u2026       PNC       pe\u2026  \n                     ra\u2026       pe\u2026       ra\u2026  \n                     (2\u2026       ra\u2026       (7\u2026  \n                     pe\u2026       (5\u2026       pe\u2026  \n                     or        pe\u2026       or   \n                     be\u2026                 ab\u2026  \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026       13\u2026       10\u2026       12\u2026       15\u2026  \n  as                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n      11\u2026       87\u2026       11\u2026       13\u2026       \n      10\u2026       75\u2026       10\u2026       12\u2026       \n      9.\u2026       62\u2026       87\u2026       10\u2026       \n      8.\u2026       50\u2026       75\u2026       87\u2026       \n      Be\u2026       0.\u2026       25\u2026       50\u2026       \n                                              \nSpecific adjustments to corporate performance \nmetrics:                                      \n                                              \n     Provision for credit losses: When        \n     calculating our adjusted average ROE     \n     and EPS growth for this award,           \n     consistent with our prior awards, we     \n     add back the after-tax impact of our     \n     provision for credit losses and          \n     subtract the tax effected impact of      \n     total net charge-offs from the net       \n     income amount. Net charge-offs           \n     represent the amount of a loan (or       \n     portion of a loan) that we remove from   \n  \u220e  our balance sheet due to being           \n     uncollectible, less any recoveries that  \n     we receive on the disposition of the     \n     loan. We expect this adjusted ROE and    \n     EPS growth to present a more accurate    \n     measurement of how efficiently we        \n     create profit, as it replaces our        \n     estimated credit losses (provision)      \n     with the actual losses we incur (net     \n     charge-offs). We make this same          \n     adjustment for the companies in our      \n     peer group, as appropriate.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Other adjustments: Adjustments will      \n     also be made on an after-tax basis for   \n     the impact to PNC and the companies in   \n     our peer group, as appropriate, of       \n  \u220e  items resulting from changes in federal  \n     tax law, discontinued operations (as     \n     such term is used under GAAP), and any   \n     acquisition costs and merger             \n     integration costs.                       \n                                              \nCommittee\u2019s limited discretionary ability     \nunder PSUs. Under the terms of the PSUs, the  \nCommittee has limited discretion to adjust the\nfinal payout. The Committee may increase or   \ndecrease the size of the final payout to      \nmaintain the intended economics of the award  \nif circumstances change. These circumstances  \ninclude external events affecting PNC or      \nmembers of its peer group or its financial    \nstatements that are outside of PNC\u2019s control  \nand not reasonably anticipated. Further, in   \nevaluating the corporate performance metrics, \nafter applying the specific adjustments       \ndiscussed above, the Committee may also       \nconsider other unusual or nonrecurring        \nadjustments (applied on a consistent basis) in\ndetermining the final award payout percentage.\nRSUs. With respect to 2023 performance, in    \nearly 2024 the Committee also granted to      \ncertain of our senior executives, including   \nall NEOs, RSUs that represent an opportunity  \nto receive shares of PNC common stock. The    \nRSUs vest pro rata over three years, with each\nof the three annual installments (tranches)   \nvesting on the anniversary of the grant date  \n(or if later, the date the Committee          \ndetermines that all risk conditions have been \nsatisfied). Vesting also requires the         \nsatisfaction of service requirements and other\naward conditions. Risk-related metrics        \napplicable to both PSUs and RSUs. The risk    \nprovisions described in this section apply to \nboth of our long-term incentive awards \u2014 the  \nPSUs and the RSUs. Objective risk-based       \nperformance metric.All long-term incentive    \nawards are subject to risk-based performance  \nreviews. The primary risk-based metric        \nmeasured as part of this review is the Basel  \nIII common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (the   \n\u201cCET1 Ratio\u201d). At the end of the performance  \nyear, PNC\u2019s minimum required CET1 Ratio was   \n7.0%.                                         \n                                              \n     Impact of risk-based performance metric  \n     under PSUs: For each year during the     \n     three-year performance period that PNC   \n     fails to meet the CET1 Ratio, one-third  \n     of the target number of PSUs granted     \n     will be eligible for forfeiture. After   \n  \u220e  the three-year performance period ends,  \n     the Committee will conduct a final       \n     performance review and may reduce the    \n     number of target shares available for    \n     payout if PNC did not meet the CET1      \n     Ratio for one or more years during the   \n     performance period.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Impact of risk-based performance metric  \n     under RSUs: Each RSU tranche is subject  \n     to the same risk-related performance     \n     metric that will be applied to the       \n     PSUs, with all or a portion of that      \n     tranche being eligible for forfeiture.   \n     After the year ends, the Committee will  \n     conduct a risk-based performance review  \n     and may decrease the number of shares    \n     available for payout under the           \n     applicable RSU tranche if PNC did not    \n     meet the CET1 Ratio as of the end of     \n     the most recent year before the vesting  \n  \u220e  date of that tranche.                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             59  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \nSubjective risk-based performance review.In   \naddition, and independent from the evaluation \nof the CET1 Ratio, the Committee may conduct  \nanother risk performance review for the PSUs  \nand the RSUs. This discretionary review would \ngenerally occur in connection with a risk-    \nrelated action of potentially material        \nconsequence to PNC. If the Committee exercises\nits discretion to conduct a risk performance  \nreview, the Committee will review and         \ndetermine if a reduction to the corporate     \nperformance factor for risk performance is    \nappropriate for the PSUs or if a reduction for\nrisk performance is appropriate for the       \napplicable RSU tranche. Dividend equivalent   \npayments. Both the PSUs and the RSUs will     \naccrue cash dividend equivalents during their \nrespective performance periods. For the PSUs, \nthe accrued dividend equivalents will be      \nadjusted by the same percentage as the target \nPSUs at the time of payout and will then be   \npaid out in cash. For the RSUs, the accrued   \ndividend equivalents with respect to a tranche\nwill pay out in cash at the same time, and    \nwill be adjusted by the same payout           \npercentage, as the RSUs to which they relate. \nOther compensation and benefits In addition to\nthe components included in the total          \ncompensation target outlined above, our       \nexecutive compensation program also includes  \nlimited perquisites (to increase efficiency   \nand focus on our business), change of control \narrangements (for continuity of management in \nconnection with a potential change of control)\nand health and retirement plans (to promote   \nhealth and wellness and post-retirement       \nfinancial security).

When establishing the  \ntotal compensation targets for 2023, the      \nCommittee reviewed available market data with \nMeridian, its independent compensation        \nconsultant, and members of management. The    \ntotal compensation targets for the 2023       \ncompensation year remained unchanged from the \nprior year for all but Ms. Guild, who was not \nan NEO last year. 2023 performance At meetings\nheld during the first quarter of 2024, the    \nCommittee reviewed PNC\u2019s 2023 performance with\nthe CEO, the Chief Risk Officer and other     \nmembers of management. In evaluating          \nperformance and determining incentive         \ncompensation awards for our NEOs, the         \nCommittee may consider several metrics,       \nwithout assigning a particular weight to any  \none metric. To evaluate PNC\u2019s 2023            \nperformance, the Committee reviewed PNC\u2019s     \nperformance against the range of metrics      \ndescribed in \u201c\u2014Our compensation               \nprogram\u2014Evaluating performance\u201d section of    \nthis CD&A, including the selected performance \nmetrics as presented in the following table.  \nThe Committee also considered the impact on   \nsome financial performance metrics (diluted   \nEPS, ROE and risk-adjusted efficiency ratio)  \nof the $515 million pre-tax FDIC special      \nassessment levied upon PNC for the recovery of\nlosses related to the closures of Silicon     \nValley Bank and Signature Bank, as well as    \nworkforce reduction charges, in order to      \nincrease comparability of these metrics across\nperiods.

In addition to\nevaluating our corporate performance based on \nthese financial and strategic metrics, the    \nCommittee reviewed the individual performance \nof each NEO. The CEO discussed the individual \nperformance of the other NEOs with the        \nCommittee and, where appropriate, discussed   \nthe performance of the lines of business or   \nfunctions managed by the NEOs. The Committee  \napproved compensation for each NEO based on an\nevaluation of corporate, business and         \nindividual performance. The Committee         \ndiscussed compensation recommendations for the\nCEO with Meridian, the Committee\u2019s independent\ncompensation consultant for 2023, our Chief   \nHuman Resources Officer, and our Head of      \nExecutive Compensation. Other than the        \nsecretary for the meeting, no other members of\nmanagement were present. The Committee also   \nreviewed the CEO compensation decisions in an \nexecutive session of the independent members  \nof the Board, with no members of management   \npresent. In that executive session, the       \nCommittee allowed time for the independent    \ndirectors to provide comments or questions    \nabout the CEO\u2019s performance or compensation.  \nAt a meeting following the Board discussion,  \nthe Committee approved the compensation for   \nour CEO in an executive session. 2023         \ncompensation decisions Based on a             \ncomprehensive evaluation of PNC\u2019s 2023        \nperformance, as described above and in the    \nfollowing sections, the Committee determined  \nthat it was appropriate to award incentive    \ncompensation that for some NEOs was at the    \ntarget amount, and for some NEOs, was above   \nthe target amount. Consistent with our        \nprogram, the Committee also decided to award  \n70% of the CEO\u2019s overall pay mix in the form  \nof long-term incentive compensation and 30% of\nhis overall pay mix in cash compensation. When\napplying this mix to the CEO\u2019s variable       \nincentive compensation, this same ratio       \ntranslates to 75% of the CEO\u2019s incentive      \ncompensation awarded in the form of long-term \nincentive compensation and 25% awarded in     \nannual cash incentive compensation. The       \nCommittee\u2019s rationale for its decision is     \ndetailed in the \u201c\u20142023 CEO compensation       \ndecisions\u201d section that follows the table     \nbelow. 2023 NEO incentive compensation awards.\nFor each of our NEOs, the table below compares\nthe incentive compensation target to the      \nactual incentive compensation awarded for the \n2023 performance year.

In   \n  making                                      \n  its decision, the Committee highlighted     \n  Mr.                                         \n  Demchak\u2019s proven ability to build           \n  long-term value                             \n  for the benefit of all stakeholders and     \n  through                                     \n  all phases of the economic cycle. His       \n  exceptional                                 \n  leadership was evident during a very        \n  challenging                                 \n  time in the industry, and the Committee     \n  believes                                    \n  his overall performance merits              \n  above-target                                \n  incentive compensation. 2023 was a          \n  tumultuous year                             \n  in the banking industry. Bank failures in   \n  the                                         \n  first half of 2023 created a crisis of      \n  confidence                                  \n  in regional banks that altered the          \n  competitive                                 \n  landscape across the industry. Against      \n  that                                        \n  backdrop, the Committee believed Mr.        \n  Demchak\u2019s                                   \n  leadership and execution of PNC\u2019s strategy  \n  resulted in PNC\u2019s successful navigation of  \n  challenging market conditions and industry  \n  uncertainty during 2023. The strength of    \n  the                                         \n  franchise was apparent during the first     \n  quarter of                                  \n  2023, as PNC was a net beneficiary of       \n  deposits                                    \n  following those bank failures. PNC added    \n  clients                                     \n  and gained market share in expansion        \n  markets                                     \n  during 2023 and is well-positioned for      \n  acquisition                                 \n  opportunities that may exist. Under Mr.     \n  Demchak\u2019s                                   \n                                              \nleadership, PNC generated record revenue, grew\nand deepened customer relationships, and      \nachieved adjusted positive operating leverage \nthrough disciplined expense management. In    \nmaking its decision, the Committee considered \nthe factors outlined in the paragraphs below. \nStrong performance during a challenging year. \nThe Committee believed PNC\u2019s financial results\nwere strong despite a volatile year for bank  \nstock performance. PNC generated record       \nrevenue of $21.5 billion supported by rising  \ninterest rates, which resulted in net interest\nincome increasing 7% and PNC\u2019s net interest   \nmargin expanding to 2.76%. PNC delivered net  \nincome of $5.6 billion, which equates to      \n$12.79 per diluted common share or $14.10 per \ndiluted common share (as adjusted to exclude  \nthe impact of the FDIC special assessment and \nworkforce reduction charges) and maintained a \nstrong balance sheet. Throughout the year, PNC\nmaintained a strong low-costdeposit base and  \nhad one of                                    \n                                              \n  64    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS the      \nlowest non-interestbearing to interest-bearing\ndeposit shifts in the peer group. During the  \nyear, PNC continued to strengthen its capital \nlevels, allowing us to acquire $16.6 billion  \nin capital commitments facilities from        \nSignature Bridge Bank, N.A. The Committee also\nnoted that, despite the volatility in the     \nindustry, PNC\u2019s shares continued to trade at  \none of the highest share price-to-            \nearningsmultiples in the peer group in 2023,  \nreflecting recognition from stakeholders of   \nthe consistent value delivered by PNC. The    \nCommittee attributes this strength and        \nconsistency to Mr. Demchak\u2019s leadership and   \ninfluence across PNC as well as the larger    \nfinancial services sector. Long-term          \nperformance durability. In evaluating Mr.     \nDemchak\u2019s performance, the Committee focused  \non his demonstrated long-term performance     \nconsistency, noting that PNC\u2019s 10-yearTSR     \nranked 2nd in the peer group and PNC\u2019s        \n5-yearTSR ranked in the second quartile of the\npeer group. The Committee did take into       \naccount PNC\u2019s 3-yearTSR, which ranked in the  \nthird quartile of the peer group but balanced \nthis result against the longer-term view in   \nlight of the volatile year for bank stocks.   \nThe Committee also considered the durability  \nof PNC\u2019s strong levels of capital and         \nliquidity and credit quality metrics, as      \nreflected by:                                 \n                                              \n     A CET1 ratio of 9.9% at year-end 2023,   \n     up from 9.1% as of December\u00a031, 2022.    \n     Based on current estimates, PNC remains  \n     well above our regulatory minimum        \n     requirements inclusive of the proposed   \n     regulatory changes related to Basel III  \n  \u220e  endgame.                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Tangible book value of $85.08 per        \n     common share, up 18% from year-end       \n  \u220e  2022, reflecting an improvement in       \n     accumulated other comprehensive income   \n     (AOCI) and organic growth in PNC\u2019s       \n     capital levels.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Net loan charge-offs to average loans,   \n  \u220e  which remained below historical levels   \n     in 2023 at 0.22%, and was one of the     \n     lowest in our peer group.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Well-controlled core expenses, noting    \n     that Mr.\u00a0Demchak led an expense          \n     initiative to reduce 2024 expenses by    \n  \u220e  $325\u00a0million to better position PNC for  \n     long-term success. In mid-2023 PNC       \n     increased its initial CIP target by $50  \n     million to $450\u00a0million and once again   \n     exceeded this target.                    \n                                              \nFurther strengthening PNC leadership and risk \nculture. The Committee also discussed Mr.     \nDemchak\u2019s vision and leadership, which was    \ncritical in strengthening the organization\u2019s  \nsuccession planning program and processes,    \ncreating a multi-level organizational         \nsuccession plan with regular Board and        \nCommittee oversight that reinforced risk      \nmanagement capabilities. Mr. Demchak promoted \nalignment of talent and resources with PNC\u2019s  \nstrategic priorities and risk management      \nexpectations, including expense and resource  \nalignment. He exceeded targeted CIP expense   \nsavings and led the organization through an   \nexpense reduction initiative while maintaining\na focus on risk framework execution and       \noversight. In summary, the Committee discussed\nthe CEO\u2019s strong performance in 2023 in       \nnavigating through the industry challenges,   \ndelivering strong financial results, and      \npositioning PNC for future growth             \nopportunities. Based on these considerations, \nthe Committee determined it was appropriate to\ngrant Mr. Demchak total incentive compensation\nof $17,500,000 for performance year 2023. 2023\nNEO compensation decisions As described above \nand in the following sections, the Committee  \ndetermined that it was appropriate to award   \nincentive compensation that was at, or        \nslightly above, the target amount for each    \nNEO. The paragraphs below set out the key     \nachievements of each NEO during 2023. In      \naddition to the 2023 performance              \nconsiderations described above, the Committee \nalso reviewed each NEO\u2019s performance with the \nCEO and considered specific individual        \nachievements, as described in the paragraphs  \nbelow.                                        \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             65  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The      \ncharts below (and for the CEO\u2019s pay above)    \nshow the base salary for 2023 for each        \nexecutive, and the annual cash and long-term  \nequity-based incentives awarded in 2024 (for  \n2023 performance).

These awards\nare intended to serve distinct retention      \nobjectives or acknowledge significant         \npromotions of senior leaders throughout the   \norganization, and, in very select             \ncircumstances, may be awarded to executive    \nofficers. As part of this program, Ms. Guild  \nreceived a five-year restricted share unit    \naward (\u201c5-YearRSU\u201d) with a grant date value of\n$2,000,000 in February 2023. Ms. Guild was not\na NEO in any prior years. In determining the  \ngrant of this award, the Committee reviewed   \nthe overall technology labor market, which    \nremains fiercely competitive and characterized\nby a constant demand for top-tiertalent across\nall industries. Ms. Guild is a visible leader \nacross the technology industry with three     \ndecades of experience in financial services.  \nThe financial services industry faces an      \nongoing challenge in securing and retaining   \ntechnology leadership adept in cutting-edge   \ntechnology and cybersecurity. In addition to  \nthe heightened emphasis on technology talent, \nparticularly as it relates to regulatory      \nexpectations within the financial services    \nindustry, the Committee also considered the   \nimportance of technology to PNC\u2019s strategic   \nobjectives. As previously mentioned, one of   \nPNC\u2019s core strategic priorities is to leverage\ntechnology to create efficiencies that help us\nbetter serve customers. The Committee granted \nMs. Guild this 5-Year RSU in recognition of   \nour technology leadership\u2019s indispensable     \nexperience and expertise in achieving these   \nobjectives. In determining the $2,000,000     \ngrant date value of Ms. Guild\u2019s award, the    \nCommittee conducted a comprehensive review of \nsimilarly positioned executives while         \nconsidering the five-year term of the award.  \nThe 5-YearRSU awards span a five- year vesting\nperiod, with 25% vesting on each of the 3rd   \nand 4th anniversaries of the grant date and   \nthe remaining 50% on the 5th anniversary of   \nthe grant date. This award does not include   \nthe ability to continue vesting following a   \nqualifying retirement and has a maximum payout\nof 100% of target. This award incorporates the\nsame risk-based performance metrics as the    \nPSUs and RSUs previously described, with the  \npotential to decrease payouts based on        \nobjective and subjective risk management      \nevaluations. Prior long-term incentive awards \nAt meetings held on January 30 and February   \n16, 2024, the Committee also approved payouts \nfrom awards that had previously been granted  \nto each of our NEOs. The Committee evaluated  \nperformance and risk-based metrics for the    \noutstanding long-term incentive awards that   \nvested based on performance for the period    \nended December 31, 2023. The Committee        \napproved a payout for each award in accordance\nwith the terms and conditions of the          \napplicable award agreement.                   \n                                              \n  Gr\u2026    Type            Per\u2026           Form  \n  Ye\u2026    of      Gra\u2026    Per\u2026    Pa\u2026    of\u00a0   \n         Awa\u2026                           Pay\u2026  \n         Res\u2026                    10\u2026    Paid  \n  20\u2026    Sha\u2026    All\u00a0    202\u2026    ve\u2026    in\u00a0   \n         Uni\u2026    NEOs            (2\u2026    sto\u2026  \n                                 Tr\u2026          \n  20\u2026    202\u2026                                 \n  20\u2026    202\u2026                                 \n         Per\u2026    All                    Paid  \n  20\u2026    Sha\u2026    NEOs    202\u2026    10\u2026    in    \n         Uni\u2026                           sto\u2026  \n                 Not                          \n                 app\u2026                         \n                 (th\u2026    Not\u00a0                 \n  20\u2026    202\u2026    per\u2026    app\u2026                 \n                 per\u2026                         \n                 not                          \n                 com\u2026                         \n  20\u2026    202\u2026                                 \n                                              \nRSUs .The RSUs vest in annual installments    \nover three years.

In addition, the \nCommittee may reduce or increase the payout   \nunder the award to maintain the intended      \neconomics of the award in light of changed    \ncircumstances \u2014 meaning external events       \naffecting PNC, its financial statements or    \nmembers of its peer group that are            \nsubstantially outside of PNC\u2019s control and    \ncould not reasonably be planned for as of the \ngrant date. In determining the corporate      \nperformance factor and final payout           \npercentage, the Committee did consider the    \nunusual or nonrecurring adjustment related to \na special assessment by the FDIC following the\nbank failures that occurred in March 2023.    \nFollowing these bank failures, the FDIC       \ninvoked the systemic risk exception to support\nuninsured depositors of the failed            \ninstitutions. To recover losses to the Deposit\nInsurance Fund, the FDIC levied a special     \nassessment to be collected from PNC and other \nbank holding companies, including all of PNC\u2019s\npeers. When considering the payout for the    \n2021 PSU awards, the Committee discussed the  \nsignificant impact to expenses of the $515    \nmillion FDIC special assessment, an event     \noutside of PNC\u2019s control. In calculating ROE  \nand EPS growth, the Committee adjusted        \nexpenses to remove this unusual and recurring \nexpense for both PNC and PNC\u2019s peers. The     \nCommittee did not consider workforce reduction\ncharges in its determination of the final     \npayout percentage for the 2021 PSU awards. The\nFDIC special assessment adjustment resulted in\na final payout percentage of 105.56%. Without \nthis adjustment, the formulaic final payout   \npercentage for the PSUs was 102.54%.          \nCompensation policies and practices The       \nCommittee adopts policies and procedures to   \nassist in the fulfillment of its duties, and  \nwe describe some of the significant policies  \nand procedures in this section. In addition to\nformal policies and procedures, the Committee \nhas several practices that it follows in the  \nfulfillment of its duties and                 \nresponsibilities. Some of those practices are \ndescribed below. Compensation and risk The    \nCommittee evaluates the risks inherent in the \nincentive compensation program. For a detailed\ndiscussion of how the Committee evaluates     \nrisk, see \u201cCompensation and Risk\u201d in this     \nproxy statement. Independent compensation     \nconsultant The Committee retains Meridian     \nCompensation Partners, LLC as its independent \ncompensation consultant. For a discussion of  \nthis relationship and the considerations the  \nCommittee takes into account when determining \nindependence, see the discussion under the    \nheading \u201cCorporate Governance\u2014Board           \ncommittees\u2014Human Resources Committee.\u201d Peer   \ngroup The Committee selects a peer group each \nyear. We use this group to help measure       \nrelative performance and to determine payouts \nunder our long-term incentive awards. We also \nuse this group for general compensation       \ncomparisons. In approving a peer group, the   \nCommittee analyzes several factors, including \nthe mix and complexity of businesses, the     \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             69  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS markets  \nbeing served, market capitalization, asset    \nsize and changes resulting from mergers or    \nshifts in strategic direction. We also look at\nthe companies with whom we generally compete  \nfor talent. We use the same peer group for    \nboth performance and compensation comparisons.\nEach year, the Committee reviews the          \ncomposition of the peer group with management \nand its independent compensation consultant.  \nFor 2023, the Committee believed that the     \nexisting peer group generally provided a      \nbalanced mix of institutions considering our  \nsize, mix and scope of businesses, products   \nand services, and sources of executive talent.\nThe peer group currently includes the         \nfollowing 11 companies, with assets and market\ncapitalization for PNC and our peer group     \nmeasured as of December 31, 2023 and revenue  \nfor PNC and our peer group measured for the   \nfull year:                                    \n                                              \n                   \u2026            \u2026             \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026             \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026       \u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n      \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n           \u2026    $  \u2026    \u2026    $  \u2026        $    \n                                              \nAfter a review by the Committee, the peer     \ngroup for 2024 remained unchanged from 2023.  \nExecutive stock ownership and retention       \nrequirements Our executive officers           \nhistorically have held a significant portion  \nof their assets in the form of our common     \nstock (or other equity-based instruments that \nreflect the performance of our common stock). \nThe Committee believes it is important to     \nrequire our executive officers to meet minimum\nstock ownership guidelines, denominated in PNC\nshares. Each executive officer must meet      \nadditional ownership requirements, even after \nmeeting the original ownership target. The    \nownership requirements increase the number of \nPNC shares that an individual must own over   \ntime with an ongoing retention requirement.   \nThis retention requirement provides that as   \nnew equity awards vest, designated executives \nmust retain a percentage of the stock, which  \nthey must generally hold until they retire or \nleave PNC. This ownership policy reflects     \ncompensation awards over an executive\u2019s career\nand ties an executive\u2019s personal wealth       \nclosely to the long-term performance of PNC   \nand the interests of our shareholders. Equity \ninterests that count toward satisfaction of   \nthe ownership guidelines include:             \n                                              \n      Shares owned outright by the officer,   \n  1.  or his or her spouse and dependent      \n      children;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  2.

Under the\npolicy, the Committee considers the           \ncircumstances of an executive\u2019s failure to    \ncomply with the policy when making            \ncompensation decisions for that executive. At \nthe time of the compensation decisions, the   \nCommittee determined that all of our NEOs     \ncomplied with the policy. Clawback and        \nforfeiture Dodd-Frank Recoupment Policy. On   \nAugust 9, 2023, the Committee adopted the     \nDodd-Frank Recoupment Policy as required by   \nthe final rules under the Dodd-Frank Act and  \nNYSE listing standards. The Dodd-Frank        \nRecoupment Policy requires us to recoup any   \nexcess incentive compensation paid to current \nor former executive officers based on         \nfinancial statements that were required to be \nrestated due to material noncompliance with   \nfinancial reporting requirements, without     \nregard to any fault or misconduct. Our Dodd-  \nFrank Recoupment Policy became effective on   \nOctober 2, 2023. The Dodd-Frank Recoupment    \nPolicy is a standalone clawback policy that   \nexists in addition to our Incentive           \nCompensation Adjustment and Clawback Policy   \n(\u201cPNC Clawback Policy\u201d), which is described in\ndetail below.                                 \n                                              \n      In the event of a triggering event      \n      under the Dodd-Frank Recoupment         \n  1.  Policy, the Committee will first apply  \n      the terms of the Dodd-Frank Recoupment  \n      Policy.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Following application of that policy,   \n      to the extent any adjustment or         \n      clawback under the PNC Clawback Policy  \n  2.  should additionally be applied, the     \n      Committee will then apply the PNC       \n      Clawback Policy to any covered          \n      incentive compensation.                 \n                                              \nUpdates to PNC Clawback Policy. Since 2013,   \nPNC has maintained a formal \u201cclawback\u201d policy \nthat applies to our NEOs and other executive  \nofficers, as well as other senior executives  \nand those employees receiving equity-based    \ncompensation. The Committee reviews and       \nupdates this clawback and incentive adjustment\npolicy on a regular basis. During 2023, the   \nCommittee approved an update to this policy to\nadd a clawback of all incentive compensation, \nwhether vested or unvested, in the event of   \ncertain \u201cdetrimental conduct\u201d events for      \ncurrent and former executive officers.        \nPreviously, these same detrimental conduct    \nprovisions applied only to unvested long-term \nincentive compensation for all equity         \nrecipients. A summary of the updated PNC      \nClawback Policy is provided in the chart and  \nparagraphs below. Clawback for inaccurate     \nmetrics. For purposes of the clawback for     \nmaterially inaccurate performance metrics,    \nperformance metrics include any metric,       \nincluding corporate financial results, used   \ndirectly or indirectly to determine whether   \nincentive compensation is to be provided to an\nexecutive (or group of executives) or to      \ndetermine the amount of any such compensation.\nThe portion of the incentive compensation that\nrepresents the excess over what would have    \nbeen provided if there had been no material   \ninaccuracy in the performance metric will be  \nsubject to clawback. The Committee retains    \ndiscretion, to the extent legally permissible,\nto determine that it would not be in PNC\u2019s    \nbest interests to                             \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             71  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nseek to enforce the clawback.

Examples of adverse risk-  \nrelated impacts. The types of adverse impacts \ncould include matters such as impacts to the  \nfinancial performance, capital or liquidity   \npositions, reputation operations (including   \ncompliance, business continuity, technology   \nand information security) or business         \nprospects of PNC or a business segment or     \ncorporate function within PNC. The negative   \nadjustment resulting from risk-related actions\nallows PNC to recoup unvested equity awards   \nfrom recipients whose inappropriate risk-     \ntaking activities have resulted in, or are    \nexpected to result in, a material adverse     \nimpact to PNC in the future. By doing so, we  \ncan further balance the risks in our incentive\narrangements by accounting for both forward-  \nand backward-looking risk adjustments.        \nDisclosure of clawback of adjustment actions  \nunder PNC Clawback Policy. The policy provides\nthat if PNC applies the PNC Clawback Policy to\nrecoup or clawback incentive compensation or  \nnegatively adjust incentive compensation as a \nresult of risk-related actions and the        \nunderlying factual circumstances are otherwise\npublicly reported by PNC in a filing with the \nSEC or in disclosure that would otherwise meet\nthe requirements for public disclosure by PNC \nunder the SEC\u2019s Regulation FD, or are         \ndisclosed by a third party in a publicly      \navailable court or administrative filing, then\nPNC will disclose                             \n                                              \n  72    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS in the   \nproxy statement for its annual shareholder    \nmeeting, a current report on Form 8-Kor other \npublic filing made by it with the SEC or a    \nposting in a clearly identifiable location in \nthe Investor Relations section of its         \ncorporate website:                            \n                                              \n     a general description of the             \n     circumstances giving rise to the         \n     incentive compensation recovery or       \n  \u220e  adjustment, including items such as the  \n     number of employees, seniority of        \n     employees and line of business           \n     impacted; and                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  the aggregate amount of incentive        \n     compensation recovered or adjusted.      \n                                              \nPNC may limit such disclosure if it would be  \nlikely to result in, or exacerbate, any       \nexisting or threatened employee, shareholder  \nor other litigation, arbitration or proceeding\nagainst PNC. Adjustments following termination\nof employment. Adjustments following          \ntermination of employment. In circumstances   \nwhere the PNC Clawback Policy requires or     \npermits an adjustment, PNC may pursue the     \nadjustments against affected covered employees\nafter termination of their employment with PNC\nfor any reason. Approval of severance         \nagreements We have a Board-approved policy    \nregarding shareholder approval of future      \nseverance arrangements. Under this policy, PNC\nwill not enter into an arrangement with an    \nexecutive officer that provides for additional\nseverance benefits in an amount exceeding 2.99\ntimes the sum of the executive officer\u2019s      \nannual base salary and target bonus for the   \nyear of termination, unless the future        \nseverance arrangement is approved by the      \naffirmative vote of a majority of votes cast  \nby shareholders on the matter. The Board      \nretains the right to amend, terminate or waive\nthe policy and will promptly disclose any such\nchange. We have made this policy available in \nthe Governance Documents section of           \nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance. None of our  \nchange of control agreements contain any      \nexcise tax \u201cgross-up\u201dprovisions. For a more   \ndetailed discussion on change of control      \nagreements, see \u201cChange of Control and        \nTermination of Employment\u2014Change of control   \nagreements\u201d in this proxy statement. Limiting \nperquisites The Committee believes in limiting\nthe number and value of perquisites provided  \nto our executives. We consider a benefit to be\na perquisite or personal benefit unless its   \npurpose is clearly and exclusively business-  \nrelated. We determine the value of perquisites\nbased on their incremental cost to us. The    \nprincipal perquisites we may provide to our   \nexecutive officers include financial          \nconsulting and tax preparation services and   \nlimited personal use of corporate aircraft.   \nTwo NEOs also remain eligible to receive      \nexecutive physicals under a legacy program    \nthat we no longer offer. The perquisites we   \nprovide to our executive officers under the   \nprogram do not include any tax \u201cgross ups.\u201d   \nDuring 2023, PNC provided physical security   \nservices to Mr. Demchak due to verified       \nincidents regarding his personal safety. PNC  \ndetermined it was in the Company\u2019s business   \ninterest to introduce these security measures \nfor his safety and security. We view these    \nsecurity services as a necessary and          \nappropriate business expense but have reported\nthe incremental costs of these services to us \nin the \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column in the \nSummary compensation table because these      \nmeasures may be viewed as conveying a personal\nbenefit to Mr. Demchak. Certain executives,   \nincluding all currently employed NEOs (other  \nthan our CEO), receive a $10,000 allowance for\npersonal aircraft usage. As the Committee has \npreviously recommended that our CEO take all  \nflights (personal or business) on the         \ncorporate aircraft, the Committee has approved\nan allowance not to exceed $100,000 for       \npersonal flights taken on the corporate       \naircraft by our CEO. The cost of any personal \nflights taken on the corporate aircraft that  \nexceed the applicable allowance are reimbursed\nby the executive pursuant to the terms of a   \ntime-sharing agreement between the executive  \nand PNC. Due to certain operational           \nrestrictions and administrative efficiencies, \nwe operate our corporate aircraft under       \nFederal Aviation Administration rules and     \nregulations that limit our ability to accept  \nreimbursement for personal aircraft usage     \nunless an individual has a time-sharing       \nagreement. The time-sharing agreement provides\na mechanism to obtain reimbursement from the  \nexecutive. The costs paid by an executive     \nunder the terms of the agreement include      \nincremental costs, as well as a federal excise\ntax and other fees. For flights subject to a  \ntime-sharing agreement, the executive is      \nrequired to pay us for the following costs:   \n                                              \n  \u220e  fuel, oil, lubricants and other          \n     additives;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     travel expenses of crew, including       \n  \u220e  food, lodging and ground                 \n     transportation;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  hangar and tie-down costs away from the  \n     aircraft\u2019s base of operation;            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  insurance obtained for the specific      \n     flight;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  landing fees, airport taxes and similar  \n     assessments;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  custom, foreign permit and similar fees  \n     directly related to the flight;          \n                                              \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             73  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          \n                                        \n  \u220e  in-flight food and beverages; and  \n                                        \n                                       \n  \u220e  passenger ground transportation.  \n                                       \nThe Committee has adopted an aviation policy  \nand written procedures to document the        \nprinciples to be applied in determining the   \nclassification of a flight as business or     \npersonal and the calculation of aggregate     \nincremental costs for perquisite purposes,    \nincluding definitions of personal use,        \nenhanced methods for allocating costs between \nbusiness and personal use in complex          \nsituations and an approach for capturing      \ndeadhead flights, where appropriate, in the   \ncalculation of incremental costs for personal \nuse of the corporate aircraft. Guidelines on  \nthe use of discretion The Committee has       \nadopted guidelines on using discretion in     \nincentive compensation plans. Under these     \nguidelines, the use of discretion will be     \nexercised, when permitted under a plan, so    \nthat incentive compensation awards are        \nreasonably aligned with risk-adjusted         \nperformance. Certain plans have discretionary \nand formulaic components, while other plans   \nare fully discretionary. For plans with both  \ndiscretionary and formulaic components, the   \nguidance provides, among other things, that a \ndiscretionary increase in otherwise           \nformulaically determined incentive            \ncompensation should be based on behaviors,    \nactions or results that are deemed to be      \nextraordinary, exceed expectations or provide \nsignificant direct or indirect benefits to PNC\nor our businesses. At the same time, a        \ndiscretionary reduction in compensation should\nbe based on behaviors, actions or results that\nfail to meet expectations or negatively impact\nour performance, reputation or work           \nenvironment. The guidelines specifically      \naddress the need to evaluate both risk-taking \nbehaviors during the performance year, as well\nas the outcome of prior risk-taking behaviors,\nwhen making discretionary incentive           \ncompensation decisions. In addition, managers \nare generally required to document how        \ndiscretion was applied considering risk-taking\nbehaviors and outcomes in employees\u2019          \nperformance evaluations or incentive          \ncompensation recommendations, particularly for\nour most senior executives. Restrictions on   \ntrading, hedging and pledging Our Code of     \nBusiness Conduct and Ethics and related       \npolicies, which apply to our employees and    \ndirectors, include anti-hedging provisions    \nthat prohibit all employees and directors from\nday trading or short selling PNC securities   \nand from engaging in transactions in any      \nderivative of PNC securities (other than      \nsecurities issued under a PNC compensation    \nplan), including buying and writing options.  \nWe prohibit certain employees, including all  \nexecutive officers, and our directors from    \npurchasing or selling our securities beginning\nthe 16th day of the last month of each        \ncalendar quarter until the second business day\nafter we release our earnings for that        \nquarter. We may also impose additional trading\nrestrictions on certain employees, including  \nour executive officers, and our directors due \nto the availability of material non-          \npublicinformation regarding PNC or our        \nsecurities. In addition, we require certain   \nemployees, including all executive officers,  \nto pre-clearpersonal investments (other than  \nin specified types of securities) made by them\nor any of their immediate family members.     \nAdditionally, we do not allow directors,      \nexecutive officers and certain other senior   \nemployees to pledge PNC securities. These     \nrestrictions also generally apply to immediate\nfamily members of the covered employees and   \ndirectors. Consideration of tax deductibility \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (the \"Code\") does not        \ngenerally allow a company to deduct           \ncompensation over $1 million paid to certain  \nexecutive officers. Although the Committee    \nconsiders the deductibility of expenses when  \nit makes compensation decisions, the Committee\nbelieves in maintaining the flexibility and   \ncompetitive effectiveness of the executive    \ncompensation program. The Committee retains   \nthe discretion to establish the compensation  \npaid to the NEOs as the Committee determines  \nto be in the best interests of PNC and its    \nshareholders, and without regard to any       \nlimitation provided in Section 162(m). Tax    \ndeductibility, while an important             \nconsideration, is analyzed as one component of\nthe overall program.                          \n                                              \n  74    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Glossary \nof performance metrics This glossary describes\nsome of the performance metrics that the      \nCommittee may use to evaluate performance and \nmake compensation decisions.                  \n                                              \n                        Bank regulators have  \n                        established           \n                        risk-based and        \n                        leverage capital      \n                        ratios to evaluate    \n                        our capital adequacy  \n                        and financial         \n                        strength.

Risk management at PNC We \nencounter risk as part of the normal course of\noperating our business.

With each of our   \nemployees, we reinforce the importance of     \nmanaging risks in executing on our strategic  \nobjectives and in support of our desired risk \nappetite. We approve our Enterprise Risk      \nManagement Framework and key risk policies at \nthe Board level. We discuss our risk          \nmanagement approach in the Risk Management    \nsection of Item 7 of our Form 10-Kfor the year\nended December 31, 2023. We reflect our       \ndesired enterprise risk appetite by helping to\nensure that our performance management and    \ncompensation arrangements for all employees   \nare balanced in ways that do not create       \nincentives for imprudent or excessive risk-   \ntaking, are designed to provide a superior    \ncustomer experience and are reflective of our \nbusiness model, management structure and risk \nappetite. Our compensation philosophy supports\nand reflects PNC\u2019s risk appetite and risk     \nmanagement culture. Our risk policies and     \nprocedures guide our management decisions,    \nincluding how we pay employees. By setting and\ncommunicating our risk appetite in advance, we\nseek to manage and control the risks that     \nemployees can take or influence, consistent   \nwith their roles and responsibilities. All    \nemployees have performance goals tied to      \nbusiness and individual performance, but each \nemployee, no matter their role at PNC, also   \nhas customer focus and risk management goals. \nWe evaluate employee performance against these\ngoals, in addition to considering risk        \noutcomes from actions taken in prior years. We\nincorporate this comprehensive evaluation of  \nemployee risk management into our performance \nand incentive compensation decisions. In      \naddition, all employees are encouraged to     \ncollaborate across groups to identify and     \nmitigate risks and elevate and address        \nidentified issues or concerns. Our            \ncompensation program is designed to encourage \nmanagement of risk within our appetite and    \ndiscourage inappropriate risk-taking by       \ngranting a diverse portfolio of incentive     \ncompensation awards to our executives and     \nother senior employees that is expected to    \nreward desired behavior over time.            \nSpecifically, we balance our portfolio of     \nawards                                        \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             77  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION AND RISK between fixed and       \nvariable compensation; cash and equity-based  \ncompensation; and annual and long-term        \ncompensation. We base awards on the           \nCommittee\u2019s assessment of a variety of        \nquantitative and qualitative performance      \nmeasurements, both on an absolute and a       \nrelative basis. Compensation decisions also   \nrely on discretion to consider other factors, \nsuch as effective risk management, delivering \na superior customer experience, compliance    \nwith controls and ethical duties, commitment  \nto diversity and inclusion, competition for   \ntop talent, market-based pay levels and the   \nneed to attract and engage our leaders. As    \ndiscussed in the CD&A, the long-term incentive\nprogram includes grants to NEOs and certain   \nother executives that include a risk-based    \nperformance metric. Payouts under these grants\ncould be forfeited if we do not meet the CET1 \nRatio described in \u201cCompensation Discussion   \nand Analysis\u2014Our compensation                 \nprogram\u2014Incentive compensation program.\u201d We   \nalso have a broad-based clawback and incentive\ncompensation adjustment policy as described in\n\u201cCompensation Discussion and                  \nAnalysis\u2014Compensation policies and            \npractices\u2014Clawback and forfeiture.\u201d We        \nmaintain an equity program for approximately  \n158 senior leaders below the executive levels \nthat is designed to help ensure that their    \nincentive compensation awards reflect risk-   \nadjusted performance outcomes that would pay  \nout, if at all, over a three-year period.     \nThese senior leaders receive a portion of     \ntheir incentive compensation in an equity-    \nbased award that is subject to the same risk- \nrelated performance metric that will be       \napplied to the PSU and RSU grants made to NEOs\nand certain other executives. Additionally,   \nthe equity award agreements for these senior  \nleaders all contain an enterprise-wide risk-  \nbased review trigger, while the agreements for\nsenior leaders in business segments (as       \nopposed to those in administrative or control \nfunctions) contain an additional, business-   \nspecific risk-based review trigger. If a risk-\nbased review is triggered, the applicable     \nreview committee will determine whether a     \ndownward adjustment is warranted, up to a     \ncomplete cancellation of the share units in   \nthat year\u2019s tranche. Risk review of           \ncompensation plans Our Chief Risk Officer     \nreports at least quarterly to the Human       \nResources Committee to discuss risk management\nand review the connection between effective   \nrisk management and incentive compensation.   \nThe Chief Risk Officer also presents the      \nCommittee with a risk assessment for each of  \nour principal business units and a collective \nassessment of staff functions, including      \nfinance, human resources, legal, operations   \nand technology. In addition, we maintain at   \nleast one director who is a member of both the\nHuman Resources and Risk Committees. At       \npresent, PNC\u2019s Presiding Director, Andrew T.  \nFeldstein, who is a member of the Risk        \nCommittee, also serves on the Human Resources \nCommittee. We also have systematically        \nidentified individuals who could potentially  \nexpose us to material amounts of risk or      \nfinancial loss. As with our incentive         \ncompensation risk assessment described below, \nwe have established a cross-functional team   \nthat continues to identify and monitor these  \nindividuals. These individuals are subject to \na supplemental risk management review as part \nof the performance management process by the  \nChief Risk Officer and his designees; we take \nthis review into account when determining     \nincentive compensation awards for our most    \nsenior executives. We have developed a        \nstandardized governance framework for our     \nincentive compensation plans to help monitor  \nand validate that our plans balance risk and  \nreward, comply with applicable laws and       \nregulations, demonstrate fiscal responsibility\nand maintain an appropriate customer focus.   \nThis framework helps to ensure that we have   \nthe appropriate procedures, controls and      \nindependent challenges in place to do so. We  \ncontinue to assess and, where appropriate,    \nmodify our incentive compensation plans in    \naccordance with this framework to help ensure \nour plans appropriately reflect risk          \nconsiderations, including the management of   \nidentified issues, the duration of the risks, \nand alignment with our desired risk appetite. \nExamples of incentive plan modifications      \ninclude:                                      \n                                              \n     Adding or increasing the visibility of   \n     risk and customer focus metrics to       \n  \u220e  plans based on the structure of the      \n     plan and the nature of the business and  \n     the roles of participants                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Adding or formalizing language around    \n     delaying award payments or recapture or  \n  \u220e  reduction of payments where subsequent   \n     risk metrics indicate excessive          \n     risk-taking                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Enhancing documentation of the plan      \n     design and use of discretion in          \n  \u220e  non-formulaic plans at the pool          \n     funding, business allocation or          \n     individual award level                   \n                                              \nBased on our approach to risk management, our \ncomprehensive incentive plan governance       \nframework, our risk assessments for           \nsignificant businesses and staff functions,   \nand the inclusion of risk-based metrics in our\nlong-term incentive compensation programs, we \nbelieve that the risks arising from our       \ncompensation plans, policies and practices are\nnot reasonably likely to have a material      \nadverse effect on PNC.                        \n                                              \n  78    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-\u20092024 Proxy Statement           \n                                              \nCOMPENSATION TABLES Summary compensation table\n                                              \n                \u2026                             \n                \u2026                             \n                \u2026                             \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026           \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        &        \u2026  \n           \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2014        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2014        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2014        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNote: Mr. Demchak served as Chairman,         \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer through \nFebruary 2024.

This column    \n     includes the cost of financial           \n     consulting and tax preparation services  \n     for Messrs. Demchak, Reilly and Parsley  \n     and the cost of personal use of          \n     corporate aircraft by Messrs. Demchak    \n     and Lyons and Ms.\u00a0Guild during 2023.     \n     The incremental cost of Mr.\u00a0Demchak\u2019s    \n     use of the aircraft in 2023 was          \n     $100,000. Mr.\u00a0Demchak used his time      \n     sharing agreement for flights in excess  \n     of this amount during 2023. The          \n     incremental cost to PNC of personal      \n     aircraft use is calculated by            \n     multiplying the total number of          \n     personal flight hours by the average     \n     direct variable operating costs          \n     (including costs related to fuel,        \n     maintenance expenses related to          \n     operation of the plane during the year,  \n     and landing and parking fees) per        \n     flight hour for the particular aircraft  \n     for the year, plus crew expenses         \n     attributable to the personal use. Since  \n     the aircraft are used primarily for      \n  *  business travel, we do not include in    \n     the calculation the fixed costs that do  \n     not change based on usage, such as crew  \n     salaries and other maintenance and       \n     inspection and capital improvement       \n     costs intended to cover a multiple-year  \n     period. For Mr.\u00a0Demchak, this column     \n     also includes the cost of physical       \n     security services ($628,182) that are    \n     in addition to security arrangements     \n     provided while at work or on business    \n     travel. During 2023, PNC provided        \n     physical security services to Mr.\u00a0       \n     Demchak due to verified incidents        \n     regarding his personal safety. PNC       \n     determined it was in the Company\u2019s       \n     business interest to introduce these     \n     security measures for his safety and     \n     security. We view these security         \n     services as a necessary and appropriate  \n     business expense, but have reported      \n     incremental costs to us of the           \n     arrangements because they may be viewed  \n     as conveying a personal benefit to him.  \n     The NEOs each have a corporate travel    \n     credit card not generally available to   \n     all employees, for which there is no     \n     incremental cost to PNC.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      We pay premiums for certain of the      \n      NEOs in connection with our Key         \n      Executive Equity Program, which is a    \n      split-dollar insurance arrangement. In  \n      addition, we pay long-term disability   \n      premiums on behalf of certain of our    \n      NEOs. New participants have not been    \n      permitted in either program since       \n      2007.

Cash balance pension plan. We      \nmaintain a pension plan for most of our full- \ntime employees. The pension plan is a defined \nbenefit cash balance pension plan under the   \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of    \n1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and is intended to\nbe qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.\nEach calendar quarter, eligible participants  \nreceive \u201cearnings credits\u201d based on a         \npercentage of eligible compensation. Earnings \ncredit percentages for employees who were plan\nparticipants on December 31, 2009 are based on\na schedule using the participant\u2019s age and    \nyears of credited service at that date and are\nfrozen at that level. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who become participants on or after \nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible     \ncompensation. The plan defines eligible       \n\u201ccompensation\u201d as regular earnings plus       \neligible variable compensation, such as paid  \nannual incentives. Eligible \u201ccompensation\u201d    \ndoes not include deferrals under the terms of \nthe non-qualifieddeferred compensation and    \nincentive plan; these are instead taken into  \naccount under our excess pension plan         \ndescribed below. We generally limit eligible  \nvariable compensation for a plan year to a    \ntotal of 100% of the first $25,000 plus 50% of\nthe next $225,000. For participants who had   \naccrued benefits prior to 1999 under the      \npension plan formula then in effect, an       \ninitial cash balance \u201caccount\u201d was established\nbased on the present value of the accrued     \nbenefits at the time of the conversion to the \ncurrent program. Plan participants generally  \nreceive quarterly \u201cinterest credits\u201d at a rate\nof one-fourthof the annual interest rate on   \n30-yearTreasury securities. Employees who were\nalready plan participants as of December 31,  \n2009 receive a minimum interest credit. We    \ncontribute to the plan an actuarially         \ndetermined amount necessary to fund the total \nbenefits payable to participants. Actuaries   \ncalculate total contributions instead of      \ncontributions for each individual participant.\nExcess pension plan. We maintain an ERISA     \nexcess pension plan, which is a supplemental  \nnon-qualifiedpension plan. The excess benefits\nunder this plan equal the difference, if any, \nbetween a participant\u2019s benefit under the     \nqualified pension plan computed without regard\nto applicable Code limits and taking into     \naccount amounts deferred under the non-       \nqualifieddeferred compensation and incentive  \nplan, and the participant\u2019s actual benefit    \nunder the qualified pension plan. Supplemental\nexecutive retirement plan. We maintain a      \nsupplemental executive retirement plan for    \ncertain executive officers. As part of its    \nongoing review of compensation practices, the \nPersonnel and Compensation Committee (now     \nknown as the Human Resources Committee)       \ndecided in 2007 to eliminate future plan      \nparticipation for new executive officers. This\nplan provides earnings credits based on a     \npercentage of annual incentives awarded under \neligible executive bonus plans in accordance  \nwith a schedule based on the participant\u2019s age\nand years of credited service. This plan also \nprovides quarterly interest credits that      \nmirror the interest credits under the         \nqualified pension plan. Executive officers who\nparticipated in the supplemental executive    \nretirement plan on December 31, 1998 and who  \nwere at least age 50 with five or more years  \nof credited service receive grandfathered     \nbenefits based on the pension formula in      \neffect prior to 1999.

Incentive savings plan (ISP). The \nISP is a defined contribution 401(k) plan that\nis intended to be qualified under Section     \n401(a) of the Code. During 2023, participants \ncould elect to contribute between 1% and 75%  \nof eligible compensation to the plan each year\nas pre-taxor Roth after-taxelective deferrals \n(or a combination of pre-taxand Roth after-   \ntaxelective deferrals), subject to Code       \nlimits. Participants who are age 50 or older  \nmay contribute additional pre-taxamounts      \ncalled \u201ccatch-upcontributions\u201d each year. For \n2023, we made employer matching contributions \non behalf of eligible participants equal to   \n100% of elective deferrals up to 4% of        \neligible compensation. Matching contributions \nwere made in cash. Participants direct the    \ninvestment of their accounts among the        \ninvestment options offered under the plan, and\ntheir account balances are adjusted for gains \nor losses resulting from those investment     \ndirections.

Distributions from these     \nplans are paid in cash in accordance with the \nparticipant\u2019s election. Participants with     \nexisting account balances can direct the      \ninvestment of their accounts among the        \nhypothetical investment alternatives made     \navailable under the plan, and their accounts  \nare adjusted for deemed investment gains or   \nlosses resulting from such investment         \ndirections. Investment options. ISP, DCIP,    \nSISP and DCP participants have the investment \noptions listed on page 90. The employee       \ndirects investment of contributions under each\nplan. Investment options include several      \ncollective funds and mutual funds (including  \nBlackRock mutual funds). ISP, SISP and DCP    \nparticipants may also hold investments in a   \nPNC common stock fund; however, we no longer  \npermit new contributions or transfers into the\nPNC common stock fund.

        \nCHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF          \nEMPLOYMENT Benefits upon termination of       \nemployment Our NEOs may receive various forms \nof compensation or benefits in connection

These benefits   \nresult from:                                  \n                                    \n  \u220e  change of control agreements,  \n                                    \n                                              \n  \u220e  the terms of our equity-based grants,    \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e  other existing plans and arrangements    \n     in which our NEOs participate.           \n                                              \nWe do not have a separate severance plan or   \nprogram for the NEOs. The Human Resources     \nCommittee has discretion to provide severance \nbenefits subject to the parameters of our     \nBoard-approved policy, as described in        \n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d in this\nproxy statement. The benefits an executive may\nreceive will depend on whether PNC or the     \nexecutive terminated employment and, if PNC   \nterminated employment, whether the termination\nwas for cause, resulted from death or         \ndisability, or followed a change in control,  \nand whether the executive is retirement-      \neligible. If a retirement-eligible employee   \nresigns or is terminated without cause, we    \nconsider it a retirement. For these purposes, \na \u201cretirement-eligible\u201d employee is someone   \nwho is at least 55 years old and has at least \nfive years of service with PNC. As of December\n31, 2023, four of our five NEOs are           \nretirement-eligible. Change of control        \nagreements As of December 31, 2023, we have   \nentered into separate change of control       \nagreements with each of our NEOs and similar  \nagreements with a limited group of other      \nsenior officers. These agreements have been a \nvaluable component of our executive           \ncompensation program for several years. We    \nbelieve these arrangements mitigate concerns  \narising from a change of control, and help to \nensure the continued dedicated service of our \nkey employees. Cash payments contemplated by  \nthese agreements require a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d \u2014 \nthat is, the occurrence of both a change of   \ncontrol and a qualifying termination of       \nemployment. A qualifying termination would    \noccur if the executive resigned for \u201cGood     \nReason\u201d or the surviving company terminated   \nthe executive other than for \u201cCause,\u201d         \n\u201cDisability\u201d or death (each as defined in the \nchange of control agreement). The treatment of\nequity awards upon a change of control is     \naddressed in the equity award agreements      \nthemselves, as described below, rather than   \nthe change of control agreements. The change  \nof control agreements provide for cash        \npayments to our NEOs calculated based on      \nvarious compensation components, including    \nannual base salary and an annual incentive    \naward (bonus). For purposes of the change of  \ncontrol agreements, annual base salary is     \nequal to 12 times the highest monthly base    \nsalary rate payable to the executive in the   \n12-monthperiod preceding the month of the     \nchange of control. The cash payment related to\nbase salary is equal to two times the annual  \nbase salary, and the cash payment related to  \nbonus is equal to two times the applicable    \nbonus percentage multiplied by annual base    \nsalary. The agreements also provide for       \ncontinued benefits under (or compute cash     \npayments by reference to) certain of our      \nretirement and health and welfare benefit     \nplans. None of our change of control          \nagreements contain any excise tax \u201cgross-     \nup\u201dprovisions. Our current change of control  \nagreements provide that in the event the      \nbenefits payable to an executive trigger      \nexcise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code,  \nthe executive will be entitled to a reduction \nin benefits so that no excise tax is imposed  \nif such a reduction would result in a greater \nnet (after-tax)benefit to the executive than  \npayment of the full amount of his or her      \nbenefits. We have a Board-approved policy that\nrequires shareholder approval of certain      \nfuture severance arrangements if the          \narrangement provides for additional severance \nbenefits in an amount exceeding 2.99 times the\nsum of the executive\u2019s annual base salary and \ntarget bonus. The change of control agreements\nprohibit the executives from employing or     \nsoliciting any of our officers during the one-\nyearperiod following termination, and from    \nusing or disclosing any of our confidential   \nbusiness or technical information or trade    \nsecrets. While the benefits to be received    \nunder a change of control agreement may be    \nsignificant to an individual, they first      \nrequire the occurrence of a significant       \ntransaction. As a result, the benefits are    \nhighly speculative and are contingent on a    \nvariety of facts and circumstances. In        \nrecognition of this, the Human Resources      \nCommittee of the Board does not consider the  \namount of potential change in control payments\nwhen it makes annual compensation decisions   \nfor our NEOs. Change in control protections,  \nalthough meaningful, also become relatively   \nless significant to PNC as we increase in     \nsize.                                         \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             91  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF          \nEMPLOYMENT Equity-based grants If an NEO      \nresigns or the NEO\u2019s employment is terminated \nwith or without cause, any unvested equity-   \nbased compensation is generally forfeited     \n(other than the Leadership Continuity Awards, \nwhich may be eligible for continued vesting   \nupon a termination without cause at the       \ndiscretion of the Human Resources Committee.  \nHowever, if an NEO retires (i.e., a           \nretirement-eligible NEO resigns or is         \nterminated without cause), equity-based       \ncompensation is not forfeited and continues in\neffect until its originally scheduled payment \ndate (other than the Leadership Continuity    \nAwards, which may be eligible for continued   \nvesting following the third anniversary of the\ngrant date at the discretion of the Human     \nResources Committee, and the 5-YearRSU award, \nwhich does not have a provision permitting    \ncontinued vesting upon a qualifying           \nretirement). Equity-based compensation is also\nnot forfeited under certain circumstances     \nfollowing a change in control. Grants to our  \nexecutive officers contain a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d \nfeature, meaning such grants require the      \noccurrence of both a change in control and a  \nqualifying termination (which includes a      \ntermination without cause or a resignation for\ngood reason) in order to vest prior to the    \noriginal vesting date in connection with a    \nchange in control. A change in control of PNC,\nretirement of an NEO or termination of an     \nNEO\u2019s employment by PNC by reason of          \ndisability has the following impact on        \nunvested equity-based compensation: RESTRICTED\nSHARE UNITS                                   \n                                              \n  Change in Control      Retirement or        \n                         Disability           \n  Following a change                          \n  in control,                                 \n  outstanding RSUs                            \n  will vest upon a                            \n  qualifying                                  \n  termination or                              \n  continued                                   \n  employment through                          \n  the original                                \n  vesting                Outstanding RSUs     \n  date, and will be      continue in effect   \n  paid as soon as        in accordance with   \n  practicable            their terms as if    \n  following the          the grantee had      \n  original               remained employed    \n  vesting date.

Vested awards are paid out no     \nlater than December 31 of the year following  \nthe year of death. Other material conditions. \nThe retirement and disability awards          \nsummarized above are generally subject to     \nforfeiture if it is determined that a grantee \nhas engaged in certain competitive activities \nduring employment or the one-yearperiod       \nfollowing termination of employment, or if the\ngrantee has engaged in other detrimental      \nconduct. In addition, the award is subject to \ngrantee\u2019s agreement not to solicit certain    \ncustomers or employees of PNC during          \nemployment and the one-yearperiod following   \ntermination of employment, to at all times    \nmaintain the confidentiality of business and  \ntechnical information, and to disclose and    \nassign certain inventions. Awards are         \ngenerally subject to PNC\u2019s clawback,          \nadjustment, or similar policies and to any    \nclawback or recoupment that may be required by\napplicable law or regulations. Existing plans \nand arrangements As of December 31, 2023, our \nNEOs could participate in our qualified cash  \nbalance pension plan, ERISA excess pension    \nplan, ISP and DCIP. In addition, Mr. Demchak, \nMr. Reilly, and Mr. Parsley participate in our\nSISP, and Mr. Demchak and Mr. Reilly          \nparticipate in our DCP (although they may no  \nlonger make contributions to these plans). The\nNEOs earn these benefits for services provided\nto us while employed, and many of these plans \nare also available on a broader basis to other\nemployees. For the most part, an NEO\u2019s        \nentitlement to these benefits does not depend \non how employment is terminated. Mr. Demchak  \nand Mr. Reilly also participate in our        \nsupplemental executive retirement plan, a     \ncompany-paid executive long-term disability   \n(\u201cLTD\u201d) program, and the Key Executive Equity \nProgram (\u201cKEEP\u201d), a split-dollar life         \ninsurance program. Participants in the        \nexecutive LTD program are generally eligible  \nfor additional LTD benefits of $10,000 per    \nmonth until they are no longer disabled or    \nhave reached age 65. KEEP provides benefits in\nthe event of a participating executive\u2019s death\nwhile actively employed (equal to 1.5 times   \nthen-current annual base salary) or following \nan eligible retirement (retirement after      \nreaching age 55 and five years of service with\nPNC, generally equal to annual base salary    \nprior to retirement). Following a change in   \ncontrol, the life insurance policy would      \ntransfer to the participating executive. The  \nsupplemental executive retirement plan,       \nexecutive LTD program and KEEP were frozen to \nnew participants as of December 31, 2007.     \nCertain NEOs are also eligible to receive two \nyears of company-paid financial planning and  \ntax preparation services upon retirement.     \n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. - 2024                             93  \n  Proxy Statement                             \n                                              \nCHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF          \nEMPLOYMENT Estimated benefits upon termination\nThe following table shows the estimated       \nincremental benefits payable to our NEOs as of\nDecember 31, 2023 as a result of termination  \nof employment in a variety of situations.     \nThese estimated amounts have been calculated  \nas if employment was terminated on December   \n31, 2023. For change in control benefits, we  \nassumed a change in control of PNC and a      \ntermination of employment by the surviving    \ncompany without cause (or a resignation of the\nofficer for good reason) on that date. To the \nextent relevant, the amounts assume a PNC     \nstock price of $154.85, the closing price of  \nour common stock on December 29, 2023 (the    \nlast trading day of the year). If we          \ncalculated these amounts using a different    \nprice, the amounts could be significantly     \ndifferent. The benefits below do not include  \nthe balances under our qualified cash balance \npension plan, ERISA excess pension plan,      \nsupplemental executive retirement plan, SISP, \nISP, DCIP or DCP unless the NEO receives an   \nenhanced benefit under the termination        \nscenario. In addition, stock options are not  \nincluded as there were no stock options       \noutstanding for the NEOs as of December 31,   \n2023.                                         \n

Since our PEO       \nreceives a larger proportion of his total     \nannual compensation in the form of long-term  \nequity-based incentive awards, the impact of  \nthe increase in stock price (e.g., in 2021) on\nour PEO\u2019s CAP is more significant than the    \nimpact on the average Non-PEO NEO CAP for that\nyear. The average Non-PEO NEO CAP for 2022    \nincludes one-time performance-based equity    \nawards to three NEOs. For a discussion of how \nour Human Resources Committee assessed our    \nperformance and our NEO pay each year, see the\n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section\nin this proxy statement and in our 2023, 2022,\nand 2021 annual proxy statements.             \n                                              \n  98    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u2009-2024 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE                        \nDescription of Relationship Between PEO and   \nNon-PEONEO CAP and PNC TSR and Relationship   \nBetween PNC TSR and Peer Group TSR            \nThe following graph sets forth the            \nrelationship between CAP for our PEO, the     \naverage of CAP for our Non-PEONEOs, and PNC\u2019s \ncumulative TSR over the four most recently    \ncompleted fiscal years.

CAP for all NEOs is generally   \naligned with PNC\u2019s net income for 2021-2023,  \nbut CAP for all NEOs in 2020 appears much     \nlower relative to our net income during 2020, \nwhich was significantly impacted by PNC\u2019s     \nstrategic sale of its 22.4% equity investment \nin BlackRock. This sale resulted in an after- \ntaxgain on sale of $4.3 billion. In 2020, net \nincome from continuing operations, which      \nexcluded the impact of the BlackRock sale, was\n$3.0 billion, reflecting closer alignment for \nthe full period presented.

It also       \u2502\n\u2502  carefully considered, among other         \u2502\n\u2502  things, PwC\u2019s qualifications and          \u2502\n\u2502  performance, the quality and candor of    \u2502\n\u2502  its communications with the Committee     \u2502\n\u2502  and PNC, and its independence,            \u2502\n\u2502  objectivity and professional skepticism.  \u2502\n\u2502  On February\u00a016, 2024, the Committee       \u2502\n\u2502  presented its conclusions regarding the   \u2502\n\u2502  selection and appointment of PwC as our   \u2502\n\u2502  independent auditors to the Board,        \u2502\n\u2502  including a determination that the        \u2502\n\u2502  selection of PwC as our independent       \u2502\n\u2502  auditors is in the best interest of PNC.  \u2502\n\u2502  Following this presentation, the Board    \u2502\n\u2502  voted unanimously to recommend that       \u2502\n\u2502  shareholders vote to ratify the           \u2502\n\u2502  Committee\u2019s selection of PwC as our       \u2502\n\u2502  independent registered public accounting  \u2502\n\u2502  firm for 2024. The Committee and the      \u2502\n\u2502  Board believe that the continued          \u2502\n\u2502  retention of PwC as our independent       \u2502\n\u2502  auditors is in the best interest of       \u2502\n\u2502  PNC.The Audit Committee and the Board     \u2502\n\u2502  have adopted a policy that if the         \u2502\n\u2502  ratification of the independent auditors  \u2502\n\u2502  does not receive a majority of the votes  \u2502\n\u2502  cast at the annual meeting, the           \u2502\n\u2502  Committee will reconsider its selection   \u2502\n\u2502  of independent auditors. However, the     \u2502\n\u2502  Committee will be under no obligation to  \u2502\n\u2502  select new independent auditors. If the   \u2502\n\u2502  Committee does select new independent     \u2502\n\u2502  auditors for 2024, we will not seek       \u2502\n\u2502  shareholder ratification of the new       \u2502\n\u2502  selection.We expect representatives of    \u2502\n\u2502  PwC to be available during the annual     \u2502\n\u2502  meeting.

For  \u2502\n\u2502  example, PNC was a key financier of       \u2502\n\u2502  Energy Transfer in 2017, which built the  \u2502\n\u2502  widely opposed Dakota Access Pipeline,3a  \u2502\n\u2502  project which incurred $7.5\u00a0billion in    \u2502\n\u2502  material social costs.4PNC additionally   \u2502\n\u2502  increased its fossil fuel financing by    \u2502\n\u2502  77% between 2021 and 2022, investments    \u2502\n\u2502  which are frequently linked to human      \u2502\n\u2502  rights abuses, particularly in            \u2502\n\u2502  Indigenous, Black, and brown              \u2502\n\u2502  communities.5For instance, PNC provided   \u2502\n\u2502  credit facilities to enable the now       \u2502\n\u2502  defunct Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which    \u2502\n\u2502  was abandoned in part due to civil        \u2502\n\u2502  rights concerns.6Additionally, PNC lends  \u2502\n\u2502  over $2.82\u00a0billion to companies           \u2502\n\u2502  producing controversial weapons,          \u2502\n\u2502  including nuclear weapons, white          \u2502\n\u2502  phosphorus, depleted uranium weapons,     \u2502\n\u2502  and incendiary weapons.7These are         \u2502\n\u2502  illegal or have prohibited use under      \u2502\n\u2502  international law due to their            \u2502\n\u2502  potentially indiscriminate and            \u2502\n\u2502  disproportionate impacts on               \u2502\n\u2502  civilians.8For example,                   \u2502\n\u2502  nuclear1https://www.ohchr.org/sites/defa  \u2502\n\u2502  ult/files/documents/publications/guiding  \u2502\n\u2502  principlesbusinesshr_en.pdf2https://www.  \u2502\n\u2502  forbes.com/advisor/banking/largest-banks  \u2502\n\u2502  -in-the-us/3https://www.banktrack.org/do  \u2502\n\u2502  wnload/does_your_money_fund_oil_pipeline  \u2502\n\u2502  s/                                        \u2502\n\u2502  mazaskatatalksdoesyourmoneyfundoilpipeli  \u2502\n\u2502  nes3f.pdf4https://colorado.edu/programfp  \u2502\n\u2502  w/sitesdefault/files/attached-files/soci  \u2502\n\u2502  al_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf5https://  \u2502\n\u2502  www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/B  \u2502\n\u2502  OCC_2022_vSPREAD-1.pdfhttps://www.aiph.a  \u2502\n\u2502  phapublications.org/doi/1-.2105/AJPH.202  \u2502\n\u2502  3.3074036https://insideclimatenews.org/n  \u2502\n\u2502  ews/18052018/atlantic-coast-pipeline-nat  \u2502\n\u2502  ural-gas-civil-rights-environmental-just  \u2502\n\u2502  ice-epa/;https://www.nrdc.org/bio/gillia  \u2502\n\u2502  n-giannetti/three-lessions-learned-axed-  \u2502\n\u2502  atlantic-coast-pipeline7https://www.wash  \u2502\n\u2502  ingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/0  \u2502\n\u2502  9/19/saudi-arabia-appears-to-be-using-u-  \u2502\n\u2502  s-supplied-white-phosphorus-in-its-war-i  \u2502\n\u2502  n-yemen/;                                 \u2502\n\u2502  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/tr  \u2502\n\u2502  ump-land-mines-cluster-munitions.html ;   \u2502\n\u2502  https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/risky-  \u2502\n\u2502  returns/8https://www.un.org/disarmament/  \u2502\n\u2502  wmd/nuclear/tpnw/                         \u2502\n\u2502  ;https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/file  \u2502\n\u2502  s/other/customary-international-humanita  \u2502\n\u2502  rian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf114THE PNC         \u2502\n\u2502  FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.\u2009-2024      \u2502\n\u2502  Proxy Statement                           \u2502\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 5 \u2014 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALweapons are  \u2502\n\u2502  designed to cause massive death and       \u2502\n\u2502  destruction, impacting long-term human    \u2502\n\u2502  health, the environment, and              \u2502\n\u2502  socioeconomic development.9Major          \u2502\n\u2502  investment institutions are divesting     \u2502\n\u2502  from producers of controversial           \u2502\n\u2502  weapons10, including over 100             \u2502\n\u2502  institutions with policies against        \u2502\n\u2502  investments in nuclear                    \u2502\n\u2502  weapons.11Although PNC\u2019s Human Rights     \u2502\n\u2502  Statement commits to upholding the UN     \u2502\n\u2502  Universal Declaration of Human Rights,    \u2502\n\u2502  it is not aligned with the UNGPs.

The Environmental and Social Risk  \u2502\n\u2502  Management (\u201cESRM\u201d) process may lead to   \u2502\n\u2502  a decision to limit exposure to           \u2502\n\u2502  individual commercial clients with        \u2502\n\u2502  elevated risk profiles.

With   \u2502\n\u2502  stakeholders\u2019 increasing interest in how  \u2502\n\u2502  their issues of concern are integrated    \u2502\n\u2502  into business decisions, PNC has          \u2502\n\u2502  responded by providing more focused       \u2502\n\u2502  information around its responsible        \u2502\n\u2502  lending practices.PNC has practices in    \u2502\n\u2502  place that are designed to effectively    \u2502\n\u2502  and deliberately embed human rights       \u2502\n\u2502  considerations in its commercial finance  \u2502\n\u2502  operations, as delineated in the          \u2502\n\u2502  Responsible Lending Practices             \u2502\n\u2502  disclosure.As an organization, PNC is     \u2502\n\u2502  committed to upholding human rights.      \u2502\n\u2502  PNC\u2019s Human Rights Statement expresses    \u2502\n\u2502  the view that support of fundamental      \u2502\n\u2502  human rights is a cornerstone for         \u2502\n\u2502  responsible business conduct and that     \u2502\n\u2502  responsible lending decisions must        \u2502\n\u2502  incorporate evolving environmental,       \u2502\n\u2502  social, human rights and reputational     \u2502\n\u2502  risk considerations alongside other       \u2502\n\u2502  business considerations including         \u2502\n\u2502  stakeholder preferences. To learn more    \u2502\n\u2502  about the human rights-related concerns   \u2502\n\u2502  PNC seeks to address for its principal    \u2502\n\u2502  stakeholder groups \u2014 namely employees,    \u2502\n\u2502  clients, communities and suppliers \u2014 see  \u2502\n\u2502  PNC\u2019s Human Rights Statement,3which is    \u2502\n\u2502  publicly available on our corporate       \u2502\n\u2502  website.PNC\u2019s Rapid Risk Screen, part of  \u2502\n\u2502  its multi-layered ESRM framework, is      \u2502\n\u2502  designed to identify potential            \u2502\n\u2502  environmental, social (including human    \u2502\n\u2502  rights), or reputational risks early in   \u2502\n\u2502  the life cycle of a proposed transaction  \u2502\n\u2502  and provide a pathway for additional due  \u2502\n\u2502  diligence and executive escalation for    \u2502\n\u2502  any proposed transactions that may        \u2502\n\u2502  entail elevated risk. For example, as     \u2502\n\u2502  discussed in the Responsible Lending      \u2502\n\u2502  Practices disclosure, the ESRM Rapid      \u2502\n\u2502  Risk Screen tool is designed to flag      \u2502\n\u2502  commercial transactions with human        \u2502\n\u2502  rights impacts on any of the              \u2502\n\u2502  following:\u220eIndigenous peoples (e.g.,      \u2502\n\u2502  Native Americans)\u220eLandowners (e.g.,       \u2502\n\u2502  through the application of eminent        \u2502\n\u2502  domain or forced displacement)1PNC\u2019s      \u2502\n\u2502  Responsible Lending Practices is          \u2502\n\u2502  available at                              \u2502\n\u2502  pnc.com/corporateresponsibility2https://  \u2502\n\u2502  apnews.com/article/nuclear-weapons-disar  \u2502\n\u2502  mament-latin-america-united-nations-gun-  \u2502\n\u2502  politics-4f109626a1cdd6db10560550aa1bb49  \u2502\n\u2502  13PNC\u2019s Human Rights Statement is         \u2502\n\u2502  available at                              \u2502\n\u2502  pnc.com/corporateresponsibility116THE     \u2502\n\u2502  PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.\u2009-2024  \u2502\n\u2502  Proxy Statement                           \u2502\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 5 \u2014 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\u220eAreas of    \u2502\n\u2502  historical, cultural or natural           \u2502\n\u2502  importance (e.g., archeological           \u2502\n\u2502  sites)\u220eAccess to a community\u2019s water,     \u2502\n\u2502  air, food, recreation (e.g.,              \u2502\n\u2502  hunting/fishing) or land (e.g.,           \u2502\n\u2502  agriculture)\u220eThe safety of communities,   \u2502\n\u2502  businesses and workersPNC\u2019s approach to   \u2502\n\u2502  ESRM relies on escalation and engagement  \u2502\n\u2502  rather than the broadscale prohibition    \u2502\n\u2502  of entire industries.The ESRM process     \u2502\n\u2502  may lead to a decision to limit exposure  \u2502\n\u2502  to individual commercial clients with     \u2502\n\u2502  elevated risk profiles. Alternatively,    \u2502\n\u2502  PNC may make a concerted effort to        \u2502\n\u2502  engage with the customer or external      \u2502\n\u2502  stakeholder to try to better understand   \u2502\n\u2502  the potential risks and develop a path    \u2502\n\u2502  forward to mitigate those risks. Client   \u2502\n\u2502  engagement\u2014rather than divestment\u2014is the  \u2502\n\u2502  preferred tool in addressing the          \u2502\n\u2502  challenges posed by environmental,        \u2502\n\u2502  social, human rights, and reputational    \u2502\n\u2502  risks that may be associated with some    \u2502\n\u2502  commercial clients.As one example, PNC    \u2502\n\u2502  believes that both conventional and       \u2502\n\u2502  renewable energy companies play a key     \u2502\n\u2502  role in an orderly, just transition to a  \u2502\n\u2502  lower-carbon economy, and as stated in    \u2502\n\u2502  its Climate Action Strategy,4PNC is       \u2502\n\u2502  committed to providing the financing and  \u2502\n\u2502  advice its clients need to create and     \u2502\n\u2502  execute on their own climate transition   \u2502\n\u2502  plans. Additionally, PNC has committed    \u2502\n\u2502  to mobilize $30\u00a0billion in environmental  \u2502\n\u2502  finance in the categories of renewable    \u2502\n\u2502  energy, green buildings, clean            \u2502\n\u2502  transportation, and                       \u2502\n\u2502  sustainability-linked bonds and loans.    \u2502\n\u2502  As of December\u00a031, 2022, PNC has          \u2502\n\u2502  deployed nearly $16\u00a0billion of this       \u2502\n\u2502  commitment. In the forthcoming 2023       \u2502\n\u2502  Corporate Responsibility Report, fiscal   \u2502\n\u2502  year 2023 progress on the environmental   \u2502\n\u2502  finance pledge will be                    \u2502\n\u2502  shared.Transactions with conventional     \u2502\n\u2502  energy companies are subject to           \u2502\n\u2502  additional due diligence designed to      \u2502\n\u2502  ensure that lending into this industry    \u2502\n\u2502  is done responsibly and with transparent  \u2502\n\u2502  communication to stakeholders. PNC        \u2502\n\u2502  publicly discloses the number of both     \u2502\n\u2502  new and existing coal, oil, natural gas,  \u2502\n\u2502  fossil fuel power generation and nuclear  \u2502\n\u2502  power generation clients subject to this  \u2502\n\u2502  additional environmental due diligence    \u2502\n\u2502  in the pages of its annual Corporate      \u2502\n\u2502  Responsibility Report. This due           \u2502\n\u2502  diligence is performed for both new and   \u2502\n\u2502  existing clients each year, including     \u2502\n\u2502  for clients that are onboarded due to     \u2502\n\u2502  mergers and acquisitions activity, such   \u2502\n\u2502  as those onboarded in connection with     \u2502\n\u2502  PNC\u2019s 2021 acquisition of BBVA USA        \u2502\n\u2502  Bancshares, Inc.PNC has an extensive      \u2502\n\u2502  history of prior engagement with          \u2502\n\u2502  stakeholders on its risk management,      \u2502\n\u2502  responsible lending practices, the        \u2502\n\u2502  nuclear defense industry, and human       \u2502\n\u2502  rights impacts.From 2017 to present, PNC  \u2502\n\u2502  has engaged ten times on this topic with  \u2502\n\u2502  advocacy groups and their affiliated      \u2502\n\u2502  organizations. Certain of these           \u2502\n\u2502  affiliated organizations have filed       \u2502\n\u2502  shareholder proposals in prior years      \u2502\n\u2502  requesting reports on the effectiveness   \u2502\n\u2502  of PNC\u2019s ESRM risk management systems at  \u2502\n\u2502  managing risks associated with lending,   \u2502\n\u2502  investing and financing activities        \u2502\n\u2502  within the nuclear defense industry. PNC  \u2502\n\u2502  representatives have additionally met     \u2502\n\u2502  with the proponent and their associated   \u2502\n\u2502  advocacy group several times to formally  \u2502\n\u2502  present the Responsible Lending           \u2502\n\u2502  Practices disclosure and ESRM framework   \u2502\n\u2502  and to answer questions about how human   \u2502\n\u2502  rights risks are addressed in commercial  \u2502\n\u2502  lending decisions. The most recent        \u2502\n\u2502  engagement with those parties was in      \u2502\n\u2502  December 2023, shortly after PNC\u2019s        \u2502\n\u2502  receipt of the proponent\u2019s proposal.      \u2502\n\u2502  This meeting was attended by PNC\u2019s        \u2502\n\u2502  internal leaders with immediate           \u2502\n\u2502  responsibility for the areas of           \u2502\n\u2502  responsible business strategies           \u2502\n\u2502  (corporate responsibility), corporate     \u2502\n\u2502  governance and investor relations.        \u2502\n\u2502  Despite the proponent\u2019s acknowledgment    \u2502\n\u2502  that the processes described in PNC\u2019s     \u2502\n\u2502  Responsible Lending Practices disclosure  \u2502\n\u2502  are nuanced and targeted to achieve a     \u2502\n\u2502  productive outcome in a complex business  \u2502\n\u2502  environment while seeking to protect PNC  \u2502\n\u2502  from risk, including human rights risk,   \u2502\n\u2502  the proponent has deemed it necessary to  \u2502\n\u2502  move forward with their proposal even     \u2502\n\u2502  though PNC believes its existing          \u2502\n\u2502  disclosures address the proponent\u2019s       \u2502\n\u2502  concerns.In fact, PNC already has very    \u2502\n\u2502  limited credit exposure to the companies  \u2502\n\u2502  cited by the proponent as \u201ccompanies      \u2502\n\u2502  producing controversial weapons\u201d          \u2502\n\u2502  (defined by the proponent as \u201cnuclear     \u2502\n\u2502  weapons, white phosphorus, depleted       \u2502\n\u2502  uranium weapons, and incendiary           \u2502\n\u2502  weapons\u201d).

The Board has adopted a         \nconfidential voting policy. With the          \nexceptions described below, this policy states\nthat all proxies, ballots, voting instructions\nfrom employee benefit plan participants and   \nvoting tabulations that identify the vote of a\nparticular shareholder or benefit plan        \nparticipant be kept permanently confidential  \nand not be disclosed. We keep votes           \nconfidential and do not disclose them to our  \ndirectors, officers or employees except (i) as\nnecessary to meet legal requirements or to    \npursue or defend legal actions; (ii) to allow \nthe Judge of Election to certify the voting   \nresults; (iii) when expressly requested by a  \nshareholder or benefit plan participant; or   \n(iv) if there is a contested proxy            \nsolicitation. Broadridge Financial Solutions, \nInc., our vote tabulator and Judge of Election\nfor the annual meeting, confirmed that its    \nprocedures will be consistent with this       \npolicy. How a proposal gets approved What is a\nquorum and why is it needed for the annual    \nmeeting? Under Pennsylvania law, we must have \na quorum before we can consider proposals at  \nan annual meeting. A \u201cquorum\u201d refers to the   \nminimum number of shares that must be present \nat the meeting. To have a quorum for the 2024 \nannual meeting, we need the presence of PNC   \nshareholders or their proxies who are entitled\nto cast at least a majority of the votes that \nall shareholders are entitled to cast. In     \ndetermining if a quorum exists, we count the  \nnumber of shares represented by shareholders  \nwho attend the annual meeting and the number  \nof shares represented by proxies. If you      \nreturn a proxy, whether you vote for or       \nagainst a proposal, abstain from voting, or   \nonly sign and date your proxy card, your      \nshares will be counted as present for purposes\nof determining if a quorum exists. Based on   \nthe number of shares of PNC common stock and  \nPNC preferred stock\u2013Series B outstanding as of\nthe close of business on the record date,     \nFebruary 2, 2024, and the common stock        \nconversion rate applicable to the PNC         \npreferred stock\u2014Series B, the presence of     \nshareholders entitled to cast at least        \n198,924,384 votes at the 2024 annual meeting  \n(attending virtually or represented by proxy) \nwill constitute a quorum.

We made  \nour proxy materials accessible to shareholders\nbeginning on March 13, 2024. You may view our \nproxy materials on our website at             \nwww.pnc.com/annualmeeting. Our proxy materials\nconsist of the following:                     \n                                              \n  \u220e  Our notice of the 2024 annual meeting    \n     of shareholders;                         \n                                              \n                               \n  \u220e  Our proxy statement; and  \n                               \n                              \n  \u220e  Our 2023 annual report.  \n                              \nUnder SEC rules relating to proxy             \nsolicitations, we may furnish proxy materials \nto our shareholders by providing internet     \naccess to those materials instead of mailing a\nprinted copy to each shareholder. Consistent  \nwith these rules, we notify shareholders when \nour proxy materials are available by sending  \nthem a Notice of Internet Availability of     \nProxy Materials, which also provides          \ninstructions on how to access our proxy       \nmaterials and vote online or, if preferred,   \nrequest a paper copy of the proxy materials   \nand a proxy card or voting instruction form.  \nWe believe this \u201cnotice and access\u201d method    \nexpedites the delivery of our proxy materials \nto shareholders and offers a convenient way   \nfor shareholders to review our information. It\nalso helps us reduce printing and mailing     \ncosts and lessen our environmental impact.    \nNote that internet addresses throughout this  \ndocument are included as inactive textual     \nreferences only and the content of those      \nwebsites is not incorporated in this document \nby reference or otherwise made a part hereof. \nCan I request a different method of delivery  \nor access for PNC\u2019s proxy materials?

If two or more PNC shareholders live  \nin your household, or you maintain more than  \none shareholder account on the books of       \nComputershare, our transfer agent and         \nregistrar, you may have received more than one\nset of our proxy materials. In order to reduce\nduplicate packages and lower expenses, we rely\non SEC regulations that allow delivery of one \nset of proxy materials to multiple            \nshareholders sharing the same address and the \nsame last name, if this type of delivery has  \nbeen consented to as provided by these rules. \nThis is referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d of the  \nproxy materials. Even if you consent to       \nhouseholding, we will deliver a separate proxy\ncard or Notice of Internet Availability of    \nProxy Materials for each account. Householding\nwill not affect your right or ability to vote.\nIf you would like to opt out of or into       \nhouseholding in the future, or would like to  \nreceive a separate copy of the proxy          \nmaterials, please contact Broadridge Financial\nSolutions, Inc. at the address or phone number\nbelow: Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 51\nMercedes Way Edgewood, NY 11717 (866) 540-7095\nYou may also receive more than one set of our \nproxy materials if you have more than one     \nbrokerage account.
