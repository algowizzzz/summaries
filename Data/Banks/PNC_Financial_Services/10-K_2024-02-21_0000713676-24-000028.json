See Note 19 Regulatory Matters for\nadditional information regarding our\nregulatory matters. Applicable laws and\nregulations restrict our permissible\nactivities and investments, impose conditions\nand requirements on the products and services\nwe offer and the manner in which they are\noffered and sold, and require compliance with\nprotections for loan, deposit, brokerage,\nfiduciary, investment management and other\ncustomers, among other things. They also\nrestrict our ability to repurchase stock or\npay dividends, or to receive dividends from\nour bank subsidiary, and impose capital\nadequacy and liquidity requirements. The\nconsequences of noncompliance with these, or\nother applicable laws or regulations, can\ninclude substantial monetary and nonmonetary\nsanctions. See the additional information\nincluded as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this\nReport discussing the impact of financial\nregulatory initiatives on the regulatory\nenvironment for us and the financial services\nindustry.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive\nsupervision and examination by many regulatory\nbodies, including the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC. These examinations consider not only\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations\nand supervisory policies of the agency, but\nalso capital levels, asset quality, risk\nmanagement effectiveness, the ability and\nperformance of management and the Board of\nDirectors, the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols and internal audit function,\nearnings, liquidity and various other factors.\n\nThe results of examination activity by any of\nour federal bank regulators potentially can\nresult in the imposition of significant\nlimitations on our activities and growth.\nThese regulatory agencies generally have broad\ndiscretion to impose restrictions and\nlimitations on the operations of a regulated\nentity and take enforcement action, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements,\nagainst a regulated entity where the relevant\nagency determines, among other things, that\nthe operations of the regulated entity or any\nof its subsidiaries fail to comply with\napplicable law or regulations, are conducted\nin an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent\nan unfair or deceptive act or practice. This\nsupervisory framework, including the\nexamination reports and supervisory ratings\n(which are not publicly available) of the\nagencies, could materially impact the conduct,\ngrowth and profitability of our operations.\n\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws, including the laws\nrelating to fair lending and prohibiting\nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\nin connection with the offer, sale or\nprovision of consumer financial products or\nservices, and for enforcing such laws with\nrespect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The\nresults of the CFPB\u2019s examinations (which are\nnot publicly available) also can result in\nrestrictions or limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity as well as enforcement\nactions against a regulated entity, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements.\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC\nby virtue of our status as a public company\nand by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature\nof some of our businesses. Our businesses with\noperations outside the U.S. also are subject\nto regulation by appropriate authorities in\nthe foreign jurisdictions in which they do\nbusiness.\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our\nrelationships and good standing with\nregulators are of fundamental importance to\nthe operation and growth of our businesses.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and\nother domestic and foreign regulators have\nbroad enforcement powers, and certain of the\nregulators have the power to approve, deny, or\nrefuse to act upon our applications or notices\nto conduct new activities, acquire or divest\nbusinesses, assets or deposits, expand our\noperations geographically or reconfigure\nexisting operations.\n\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a\nhigh level of regulatory focus are compliance\nwith the BSA/AML laws, capital and liquidity\nmanagement (including contingency, recovery,\nand resolution planning), the structure and\neffectiveness of enterprise risk management\nframeworks (including for climate-related\nrisks), the protection of confidential\ncustomer information, cybersecurity, the\noversight of arrangements with third-party\nvendors and suppliers, use of unapproved\nmessaging applications by employees in\nregulated entities, and compliance with fair\nlending and other consumer protection laws and\nregulations, including those governing retail\nsales practices, fee disclosures, unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive acts or practices,\ncollection practices, and protections for\nmilitary service members.\n\nThe profitability of our businesses also is\naffected by rules and regulations that impact\nthe business and financial sectors in general,\nincluding laws governing taxation, antitrust\nregulation, electronic commerce, data security\nand privacy.\n\nThere are numerous rules governing the\nregulation of financial services institutions\nand their holding companies. Accordingly, the\nfollowing discussion is general in nature and\ndoes not purport to be complete or to describe\nall of the laws, regulations and policies that\napply to us. To a substantial extent, the\npurpose of the regulation and supervision of\nfinancial services institutions and their\nholding companies is not to protect our\nshareholders and our non-customer creditors,\nbut rather to protect our customers (including\ndepositors), the financial markets and\nfinancial system in general.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation and Supervision          \n                                              \nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress\nTesting and Capital Planning . PNC and PNC\nBank are subject to the regulatory capital\nrequirements established by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC, respectively. The\nfoundation of the agencies\u2019 regulatory capital\nrules is the international regulatory capital\nframework developed by the Basel Committee,\nthe international body responsible for\ndeveloping global regulatory standards for\nbanking organizations for consideration and\nadoption by national jurisdictions. The\nregulatory capital rules establish minimum\nrequirements for the ratio of a banking\norganization\u2019s regulatory capital to its risk-\nweighted assets, referred to as risk-based\ncapital requirements, as well as for the ratio\nof its regulatory capital to measures of\nassets and other exposures, referred to as\nleverage capital requirements. The agencies\u2019\nregulatory capital rules have undergone\nsignificant change since 2013, when the\nagencies adopted final rules to implement the\nBasel Committee\u2019s international regulatory\ncapital framework, known as \u201cBasel III\u201d, as\nwell as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. On\nJuly 27, 2023, and as described in more detail\nbelow, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC\nproposed for public comment an interagency\nrule to implement the final components of the\nBasel III framework that would significantly\nrevise the capital requirements for large\nbanking organizations, including PNC and PNC\nBank.\n\nThe federal banking agencies currently tailor\nthe application of their capital, liquidity\nand enhanced prudential requirements for\nbanking organizations to the asset size and\nrisk profile (as measured by certain\nregulatory metrics) of the banking\norganization. The agencies\u2019 capital and\nliquidity rules classify all BHCs with $100\nbillion or more in total assets into one of\nfour categories (Category I, Category II,\nCategory III and Category IV), with the most\nstringent capital and liquidity requirements\napplying to Category I firms and the least\nrestrictive requirements applying to Category\nIV firms. The classification of any bank\nsubsidiary of a BHC generally follows that of\nits parent BHC. PNC and PNC Bank currently are\nCategory III firms because PNC (i) has more\nthan $250 billion, but less than $700 billion,\nin consolidated total assets, (ii) is not\ndesignated as a GSIB, and (iii) has less than\n$75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity.\nUnder current rules, any of these no longer\nbeing the case, PNC and PNC Bank would become\na Category I or II institution, and subject to\nmore stringent capital and liquidity\nstandards. As of December 31, 2023, PNC had\ncross-jurisdictional activities for these\npurposes of $21.3 billion. Some of the\nbenefits of tailored application of capital,\nliquidity, and enhanced prudential\nrequirements under current rules may be\nreversed if the agencies adopt, as proposed,\ncertain rules issued in 2023 for comment as\ndescribed further below.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide\nregulatory capital into three components: CET1\ncapital, additional Tier 1 capital (which,\ntogether with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1\ncapital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is\ngenerally common stock, retained earnings, and\nqualifying minority interests less required\ndeductions. As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank\nhave elected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\nAdditional Tier 1 capital generally includes,\namong other things, perpetual preferred stock\nand qualifying minority interests, less\nrequired deductions. Tier 2 capital generally\ncomprises qualifying subordinated debt and,\nsubject to certain quantitative limits, ACL,\nless any required deductions from Tier 2\ncapital. The regulatory capital rules limit\nthe extent to which minority interests in\nconsolidated subsidiaries may be included in\nregulatory capital. Total capital is the sum\nof Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                   Form 10-K 3\nUnder the current regulatory capital rules,\nPNC and PNC Bank must deduct investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs\nand deferred tax assets (in each case, net of\nassociated deferred tax liabilities) from CET1\ncapital to the extent such categories\nindividually exceed 25% of the institution\u2019s\nadjusted CET1 capital. As of December 31,\n2023, PNC and PNC Bank\u2019s investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs\nand deferred tax assets did not exceed this\nthreshold.\n\nThe agencies\u2019 capital rules permit banking\norganizations that were subject to CECL during\n2020 to delay CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital. PNC elected to delay the estimated\nimpact of CECL on CET1 capital through\nDecember 31, 2021, followed by a three-year\ntransition period. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital is defined as the change in\nretained earnings at adoption plus or minus\n25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance\nsheet date, excluding the allowance for PCD\nloans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption.\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nis now in the three-year transition period,\nand the full impact of the CECL standard is\nbeing phased-in to regulatory capital through\nDecember 31, 2024. See Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies for more detail on CECL and the ACL.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the\nstandardized approach for determining risk-\nweighted assets for purposes of calculating\nthe risk-based capital ratios. The\nstandardized approach for risk-weighted assets\ntakes into account credit and market risk. To\ncalculate risk-weighted assets under the\nstandardized approach for credit risk, the\nnominal dollar amounts of assets and credit\nequivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items\nare generally multiplied by risk weights set\nforth in the rules, with the risk weights\nincreasing as the perceived credit risk of the\nrelevant asset or exposure increases. For\ncertain types of exposures, such as\nsecuritization exposures, the standardized\napproach establishes one or more methodologies\nthat are to be used to calculate the risk-\nweighted asset amount for the exposure. High\nvolatility commercial real estate, past due,\nand equity exposures, as well as MSRs and\ndeferred tax assets that are not deducted from\ncapital, are generally subject to higher risk\nweights than other types of exposures. Under\nthe market risk capital rule, risk-weighted\nasset amounts for covered trading positions\nare determined based on the calculation of VaR\n(including stressed VaR), specific risk,\nincremental risk and comprehensive risk\namounts, as specified in the capital rules.\n\nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated\nusing the definition of capital under the\nagencies\u2019 Basel III capital rules and, for the\nrisk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted\nassets, as our Basel III regulatory capital\nratios.\n\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain\nminimum standards for the capital ratios of\nbanking organizations, including PNC and PNC\nBank. Banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital\nratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of\n8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-\nweighted assets, to be considered \u201cadequately\ncapitalized.\u201d BHCs subject to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s CCAR process, such as PNC, are\nsubject to a CET1 SCB. The SCB is calculated\nbased on the difference between a firm\u2019s\nstarting and minimum CET1 ratio (as projected\nby the Federal Reserve) in the supervisory\nseverely adverse scenario during the CCAR\nprocess, plus four quarters of the\norganization\u2019s planned common stock dividends\n(expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted\nassets), subject to a floor of 2.5%. Based on\nPNC\u2019s performance under the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nsupervisory stress tests as part of CCAR 2023,\nPNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter period\nbeginning October 1, 2023 is the regulatory\nminimum of 2.5%. While PNC Bank is not subject\nto a SCB, PNC Bank is required to maintain a\ncapital conservation buffer in the form of\nCET1 equal to a fixed 2.5% of risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based\ncapital above the minimum risk-based capital\nratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case\nof PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the\ncase of PNC Bank) in order to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends and executing\nrepurchases or redemptions of any Tier 1\ncapital instrument, such as common and\nqualifying preferred stock, and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nAs a result, to avoid limitations on capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary\nincentive compensation payments, PNC and PNC\nBank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at\nleast 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least\n8.5%, and a Total capital ratio of at least\n10.5%. In addition, while a firm\u2019s SCB is\ntypically determined as part of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual CCAR process, the Federal\nReserve has the right to conduct supervisory\nstress tests, require a firm to submit a\nrevised capital plan and calculate a firm\u2019s\nSCB more frequently. BHCs subject to a SCB,\nsuch as PNC, generally may increase their\ncapital distributions without seeking prior\nFederal Reserve approval, provided the BHC\notherwise complies with its SCB and any other\napplicable capital or capital distribution\nrequirements.\n\nFor Category III banking organizations (such\nas PNC and PNC Bank), the Federal Reserve and\nOCC can supplement these higher SCB or capital\nconservation buffer levels above the\nregulatory minimums by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer, which must\nbe held in the form of CET1 capital, is\ncurrently set at zero in the U.S. A Federal\nReserve policy statement establishes the\nframework and factors the Federal Reserve\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer.\nCovered banking organizations would generally\nhave 12 months after the announcement of any\nincrease in the countercyclical capital buffer\nto meet the increased buffer requirement,\nunless the Federal Reserve establishes an\nearlier effective date.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that\nbanking organizations maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to\naverage consolidated assets, referred to as\nthe leverage ratio, and require Category III\nbanking organizations to maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total\nleverage exposure, referred to as the\nsupplementary leverage ratio. Total leverage\nexposure takes into account on-balance sheet\nassets as well as certain off-balance sheet\nitems, including loan commitments and\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\npotential future exposure under derivative\ncontracts. Banking organizations are required\nto maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to total assets of 4.0%, and Category\nIII banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the leverage and\nsupplementary leverage ratios of PNC and PNC\nBank were above the required minimum level.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are not currently subject to\nthe additional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum\nlong-term debt requirement, minimum total\nloss-absorbing capacity or enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirements that\napply to U.S. GSIBs. However, it is possible\nthat the agencies may apply one or more of\nthese requirements in the future to additional\nBHCs or insured depository institutions like\nPNC and PNC Bank. In August 2023, the federal\nbanking agencies proposed rules that would\nrequire Category II, III, and IV bank holding\ncompanies and banks to issue and maintain\nminimum amounts of long-term debt that satisfy\ncertain requirements. Additionally, Category\nII, III, and IV bank holding companies would\nbe subject to \u201cclean holding company\u201d\nrequirements, which would prohibit such\ncompanies from entering into certain financial\narrangements and cap certain liabilities. PNC,\nas a Category III holding company, and PNC\nBank would be subject to the rules and would\nhave a three-year phase-in period after any\nfinal rule to achieve compliance with the\nlong-term debt requirements. If the long-term\ndebt rules were finalized in their current\nform, we would expect to achieve compliance\nthrough normal course funding.\n\nFailure to meet applicable capital\nrequirements could subject a banking\norganization to a variety of enforcement\nremedies available to the federal banking\nagencies, including limitations on capital\ndistributions, the issuance of a capital\ndirective to increase capital and, in severe\ncases, the termination of deposit insurance by\nthe FDIC and the appointment of a conservator\nor receiver. In some cases, the extent of\nthese powers depends upon whether the\ninstitution in question is considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly\nundercapitalized\u201d or \u201ccritically\nundercapitalized.\u201d The thresholds at which an\ninsured depository institution is considered\n\u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly\nundercapitalized\u201d or \u201ccritically\nundercapitalized\u201d are based on (i) the\ninstitution\u2019s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-\nbased capital ratios; (ii) the institution\u2019s\nleverage ratio; and (iii) for the definitions\nof \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cundercapitalized\u201d, the institution\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio (if applicable).\nGenerally, the smaller an institution\u2019s\ncapital base in relation to its risk-weighted\nor total assets, the greater the scope and\nseverity of the agencies\u2019 powers. Business\nactivities may also be affected by an\ninstitution\u2019s capital classification. For\nexample, PNC and PNC Bank must remain \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d for PNC to continue to take\nadvantage of financial holding company status\nas described below.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the required ratios for\nclassification as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For\nadditional discussion of capital adequacy\nrequirements, including the levels of capital\nrequired to be considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\nsee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nReport and Note 19 Regulatory Matters.\n\nThe federal banking agencies issued a proposed\nrule in July 2023 to implement the final\ncomponents of the Basel III framework. The\nrule generally would align the regulatory\ncapital elements and required deductions for\nCategory III banking organizations, such as\nPNC and PNC Bank, with those currently\napplicable to Category I and II banking\norganizations and apply a new expanded risk-\nbased approach for calculating risk-weighted\nassets (the \u201cexpanded risk-based approach\u201d).\nAmong other impacts, PNC and PNC Bank would be\nrequired to recognize most elements of AOCI in\nregulatory capital and deduct from CET1\ncapital, among other items, MSRs, deferred tax\nassets, and investments in unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions that individually\nexceed 10% of CET1 capital or in the aggregate\nwith other threshold items that exceed 15% of\nCET1 capital. The new expanded risk-based\napproach to calculating risk-weighted assets\nwould apply more granular and standardized\nrisk-weighting methodologies for credit,\noperational, market, equity and credit\nvaluation adjustment risks. PNC and PNC Bank\nwould be required to calculate their risk-\nbased capital ratios under the existing\nstandardized approach and the expanded risk-\nbased approach and would be subject to the\nlower of the two resulting ratios for their\nrisk-based capital minimum and buffer\nrequirements, including the SCB. The proposal\nindicates the effective date of the final rule\nwould be July 1, 2025, with certain provisions\nhaving a three-year phase-in period, including\nthe recognition of AOCI elements in regulatory\ncapital and the increase in risk-weighted\nassets due to the expanded risk-based\napproach. Based on our December 31, 2023\nbalance sheet, PNC and PNC Bank expect to\nremain above the current minimum capital and\nbuffer requirements if the proposal were\nfinalized in its current form.\n\nIn addition to regulatory capital\nrequirements, we are subject to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital plan rule, capital stress\ntesting requirements and CCAR process, as well\nas the DFAST requirements of the Federal\nReserve and the OCC.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal\nReserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of\nthe capital planning process of BHCs,\nincluding PNC, that have $100 billion or more\nin total consolidated assets. For us, this\ncapital planning assessment is based on a\nreview of a comprehensive capital plan\nsubmitted to the Federal Reserve that\ndescribes the Company\u2019s planned capital\nactions, such as plans to pay or increase\ncommon stock dividends, engage in common stock\nrepurchase programs, or issue or redeem\npreferred stock or other regulatory capital\ninstruments during a nine quarter review\nperiod, as well as the results of stress tests\nconducted by both the company and the Federal\nReserve under different hypothetical\nmacroeconomic scenarios, including a\nsupervisory severely adverse scenario provided\nby the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s\ncapital plan rule provides that a BHC must\nresubmit a new capital\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                   Form 10-K 5\nplan prior to the next annual submission date\nif, among other things, there has been or will\nbe a material change in the BHC\u2019s risk\nprofile, financial condition or corporate\nstructure since its last capital plan\nsubmission.\n\nIn evaluating PNC\u2019s capital plan, the Federal\nReserve also considers a number of qualitative\nfactors. In assessing a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes, the Federal\nReserve considers whether the BHC has sound\nand effective governance to oversee these\nprocesses. The Federal Reserve\u2019s evaluation\nfocuses on whether a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes are supported by\na strong risk management framework to\nidentify, measure and assess material risks\nand that provides a strong foundation to\ncapital planning. The Federal Reserve also\nconsiders the comprehensiveness of a BHC\u2019s\ncontrol framework and evaluates a BHC\u2019s policy\nguidelines for capital planning and assessing\ncapital adequacy. A BHC\u2019s stress testing\nscenario design processes and approaches for\nestimating the impact of stress on its capital\nposition, including stress testing models and\nnon-model qualitative approaches, may be\nreviewed to ensure that projections reflect\nthe impact of appropriately stressful\nconditions, as well as risks idiosyncratic to\nthe BHC, on its capital position. Significant\ndeficiencies in a BHC\u2019s capital planning and\nstress testing processes may result in\nsupervisory directives that require the firm\nto address the identified deficiencies and,\npotentially, a downgrade in the BHC\u2019s\nsupervisory capital positions and planning\nrating.\n\nIn connection with the 2024 CCAR exercise, we\nmust file our capital plan and stress testing\nresults using financial data as of December\n31, 2023, with the Federal Reserve by April 5,\n2024. In June 2024, we expect to receive PNC\u2019s\npreliminary SCB for the four-quarter period\nbeginning October 1, 2024. The Federal Reserve\nmust provide firms their final SCB for this\nperiod by August 31, 2024, which would reflect\nany changes made to the firm\u2019s planned common\nstock dividends to remain in compliance with\nthe firm\u2019s SCB.\n\nAs a Category III institution, PNC must\nconduct a company-run DFAST stress test in\neven numbered years and release PNC\u2019s\nprojections of certain revenue, loss and\ncapital results from the exercise under the\nagencies\u2019 hypothetical supervisory severely\nadverse macroeconomic scenario and applying\nthe agencies\u2019 DFAST capital action\nassumptions.\n\nAs part of the DFAST and annual CCAR\nprocesses, the Federal Reserve releases\ncertain revenue, loss and capital results for\neach participating firm from its supervisory\nstress testing exercises.\n\nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity\nRisk Management Requirements . The Basel\nCommittee\u2019s Basel III framework also includes\nshort-term liquidity standards and long-term\nfunding standards, the LCR and NSFR,\nrespectively.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies\u2019 LCR rules are\ndesigned to ensure that covered banking\norganizations maintain an adequate level of\ncash and high-quality liquid assets to meet\nestimated net liquidity needs in a short-term\nstress scenario using liquidity inflow and\noutflow assumptions prescribed in the rules\n(net cash outflow). A company\u2019s LCR is the\namount of its high-quality liquid assets\ndivided by its net cash outflows, expressed as\na percentage, and as calculated under the\nrules. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered\nbanking organizations are required to maintain\nis 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to\ncalculate the LCR on a daily basis. If either\ninstitution\u2019s LCR is below the minimum\nrequirement for three consecutive business\ndays, the institution must promptly provide\nits regulator with a plan for achieving\ncompliance with the minimum LCR requirement.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. A covered BHC\u2019s NSFR is\nthe ratio of its available stable funding to\nits required stable funding amount (as\ncalculated under the rules) over a one-year\nhorizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all\ncovered banking organizations (expressed as a\npercentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR daily. If either\ninstitution\u2019s NSFR falls, or is likely to fall\nbelow, the minimum requirement, the\ninstitution must provide its regulator with a\nplan for achieving compliance with the minimum\nNSFR requirement.\n\nAs Category III institutions with less than\n$75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale\nfunding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to\nreduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each\ncompany\u2019s LCR net cash outflows and NSFR\nrequired stable funding (as calculated under\nthe rules) reduced by 15%, thereby reducing\nthe amount of high-quality liquid assets or\navailable stable funding each institution must\nhold to meet the LCR and NSFR minimum\nrequirements, respectively. As of December 31,\n2023, PNC had weighted short-term wholesale\nfunding for these purposes of $33.1 billion.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs,\nincluding PNC, to publicly disclose certain\nquantitative and qualitative measures of their\nLCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These\ndisclosures include major components used to\ncalculate the LCR and NSFR ( e.g. , high-\nquality liquid assets, cash outflows and\ninflows for the LCR, and available stable\nfunding and required stable funding for the\nNSFR, at the consolidated parent company), and\na qualitative discussion of the BHC\u2019s LCR and\nNSFR results, including, among other things,\nkey drivers of the results, composition of\nhigh-quality liquid assets and available\nstable funding, and concentration of funding\nsources.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nAdditionally, as a Category III institution,\nPNC also must, among other things, conduct\ninternal liquidity stress tests over a range\nof time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly\nliquid assets sufficient to meet projected net\ncash outflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity\nstress test and maintain a contingency funding\nplan that meets certain requirements.\n\nFor additional discussion of regulatory\nliquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of this Report.\n\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and\nDividends . The principal source of our\nliquidity at the parent company level is\ndividends and other capital distributions from\nPNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject to various\nrestrictions on its ability to pay dividends\nto PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which\nis a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. PNC Bank also\nis subject to federal laws limiting extensions\nof credit to its parent holding company and\nnon-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 19\nRegulatory Matters. Further information on\nbank level liquidity and parent company\nliquidity is also available in the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of this Report.\n\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is\nexpected to serve as a source of financial\nstrength to its subsidiary banks and to commit\nresources to support such banks if necessary.\nDodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve\njointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the\nFDIC to implement this source of strength\nrequirement. These joint rules have not yet\nbeen proposed. Consistent with this source of\nstrength policy for subsidiary banks, the\nFederal Reserve has stated that, as a matter\nof prudent banking, a BHC generally should not\nmaintain a rate of cash dividends unless its\nnet income available to common shareholders\nhas been sufficient to fully fund the\ndividends and the prospective rate of earnings\nretention appears to be consistent with the\ncorporation\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and\noverall financial condition. Further, in\nproviding guidance to the large BHCs\nparticipating in the CCAR exercise, such as\nPNC as discussed above, the Federal Reserve\nhas expected capital plans to reflect\nconservative dividend payout ratios.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Requirements . Under\nFederal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with\ntotal consolidated assets of $100 billion or\nmore are subject to various enhanced\nprudential standards related to liquidity risk\nmanagement and overall risk management. For\nPNC, these rules, among other things,\nestablish liquidity stress testing\nrequirements (discussed above), limitations on\nPNC\u2019s aggregate net credit exposures to any\nsingle, unaffiliated company (referred to as\nSCCL), and certain oversight and governance\nresponsibilities for PNC\u2019s Chief Risk Officer,\nthe Board of Directors, and the Risk Committee\nof the Board of Directors. Under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s SCCL rules, PNC\u2019s aggregate net\ncredit exposure (including exposure resulting\nfrom, among other transactions, extensions of\ncredit, repurchase and reverse repurchase\ntransactions, investments in securities and\nderivative transactions) to any unaffiliated\ncounterparty may not exceed 25% of PNC\u2019s Tier\n1 capital.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop\nthe set of enhanced prudential standards that\napply to large BHCs in order to further\npromote the resiliency of such firms and the\nU.S. financial system. For additional\ninformation, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this\nReport.\n\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act . The GLB\nAct permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to\nbecome a \u201cfinancial holding company\u201d and\nthereby engage in, or affiliate with companies\nengaging in, a broader range of financial\nactivities than would otherwise be permitted\nfor a BHC. Permitted affiliates include\nsecurities underwriters and dealers, insurance\ncompanies, insurance agents and companies\nengaged in other activities that are\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of the\nTreasury, to be \u201cfinancial in nature or\nincidental thereto\u201d or are determined by the\nFederal Reserve unilaterally to be\n\u201ccomplementary\u201d to financial activities. We\nbecame a financial holding company in 2000. A\nBHC qualifies to become a financial holding\ncompany if the BHC and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions are \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nand \u201cwell managed\u201d and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions have a rating under\nthe CRA of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or better. Among\nother activities, we currently rely on our\nstatus as a financial holding company to\nconduct merchant banking activities and\nsecurities underwriting and dealing\nactivities. As subsidiaries of a financial\nholding company under the GLB Act, our non-\nbank subsidiaries are generally allowed to\nconduct new financial activities, and we\ngenerally are permitted to acquire non-bank\nfinancial companies that have less than $10\nbillion in assets, with after-the-fact notice\nto the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying\nnational banks to engage in expanded\nactivities through a \u201cfinancial subsidiary.\u201d\nPNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary\ncertification with the OCC and currently\nengages in insurance agency activities through\nfinancial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also\ngenerally engage through a financial\nsubsidiary in any activity that is determined\nto be financial in nature or incidental to a\nfinancial activity by the Secretary of the\nTreasury, in consultation with the Federal\nReserve (other than insurance underwriting\nactivities, insurance company investment\nactivities and merchant banking). In order to\nestablish a financial subsidiary, a national\nbank and each of its depository institution\naffiliates must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cwell managed\u201d and the national bank and each\nof its depository institution affiliates must\nhave a CRA rating of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or better.\n\nIf a financial holding company or a national\nbank with a financial subsidiary fails to\ncontinue to meet the applicable \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d or \u201cwell managed\u201d criteria, the\nfinancial holding company or national bank\nmust enter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among\nother things, identifies how the capital or\nmanagement deficiencies will be corrected.\nUntil such\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                   Form 10-K 7\ndeficiencies are corrected, the relevant\nagency may impose limits or conditions on the\nactivities of the company or bank, and the\ncompany or bank may not engage in, or acquire\na company engaged in, the types of expanded\nactivities only permissible for a financial\nholding company or financial subsidiary\nwithout prior approval of the relevant agency.\n\nIn addition, a financial holding company\ngenerally may not engage in a new financial\nactivity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire\na company engaged in such a new activity, if\nany of its insured depository institutions\nreceives a CRA rating of less than\n\u201cSatisfactory.\u201d A national bank\u2019s financial\nsubsidiary generally may not engage in a new\nfinancial activity authorized by the GLB Act,\nor acquire a company engaged in such a new\nfinancial activity, if the national bank or\nany of its insured depository institution\naffiliates received a CRA rating of less than\n\u201cSatisfactory.\u201d The CRA and its implementing\nregulations require the agencies to assess a\nbank\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of\nthe communities in which they do business,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. At December 31, 2023, PNC Bank\nhad a rating of \u201cOutstanding\u201d with respect to\nCRA. On October 24, 2023, the federal banking\nagencies issued a final rule to amend the\nregulations implementing the CRA. The rule\nsignificantly expands the number of areas in\nwhich a bank is evaluated, materially changes\nthe tests used to evaluate the bank in those\nareas and expands the data a bank must collect\nand report. The final rule takes effect April\n1, 2024, but the majority of its operative\nprovisions are effective January 1, 2026, with\nthe data reporting requirements effective\nJanuary 1, 2027. We expect the rule will\nincrease PNC Bank\u2019s obligations and compliance\ncosts necessary to achieve a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d rating under the CRA.\n\nVolcker Rule . The Volcker Rule and its\nimplementing regulations prohibit banking\nentities from engaging in short-term trading\nas principal and having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with hedge\nfunds, private equity funds, and certain other\nprivate funds (together, \u201ccovered funds\u201d),\nunless an exemption or exception applies. For\nexample, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule\nallow banking entities to trade as principal\nfor securities underwriting, market making and\nrisk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a\nvariety of conditions. PNC and PNC Bank are\nsubject to simplified and tailored compliance\nprogram requirements because each entity has\ntrading assets and liabilities of less than\n$20 billion.\n\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and\nSupervision . The federal banking agencies\npossess broad powers to take corrective action\nas deemed appropriate based on the actions,\noperations or risk management programs of a\nBHC, an insured depository institution or\ntheir subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve and\nthe OCC have the ability to take enforcement\naction against PNC and PNC Bank, respectively,\nto prevent and remedy acts and practices that\nthe agencies determine to be unfair or\ndeceptive. A finding that we have engaged in a\ndeceptive act or practice may have collateral\nconsequences on our ability to rely on certain\nexemptions in, or take advantage of certain\nprovisions of, the securities laws absent a\ngovernment waiver of such restrictions.\n\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination\nratings, lower capital or liquidity ratios\nthan peer group institutions, or regulatory\nconcerns regarding management, controls,\nassets, operations or other factors can all\npotentially result in practical limitations on\nthe ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new\nactivities, grow, acquire new businesses, make\ncapital distributions or continue to conduct\nexisting activities. Furthermore, the OCC has\nestablished certain heightened risk management\nand governance standards for large banks,\nincluding PNC Bank. The guidelines, among\nother things, establish minimum standards for\nthe design and implementation of a risk\ngovernance framework, describe the appropriate\nrisk management roles and responsibilities of\nfront line units, independent risk management,\ninternal audit, and the board of directors,\nand provide that a covered bank should have a\ncomprehensive written statement that\narticulates its risk appetite and serves as a\nbasis for the framework. If the OCC determines\nthat a covered national bank is not in\ncompliance with these or other enforceable\nguidelines (including guidelines relating to\ninformation security standards), the OCC may\nrequire the bank to submit a corrective action\nplan and may initiate enforcement action\nagainst the bank if an acceptable plan is not\nsubmitted or the bank fails to comply with an\napproved plan.\n\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve\nAct and the Federal Reserve\u2019s implementing\nregulation, Regulation W, place quantitative\nand qualitative restrictions on covered\ntransactions between a bank and its affiliates\n(for example between PNC Bank, on the one\nhand, and The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. and its non-bank subsidiaries, on the\nother hand). In general, Section 23A and\nRegulation W limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and any single\naffiliate to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and all its\naffiliates to 20% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing\nlow-quality assets from an affiliate and\nrequire certain covered transactions to be\nsecured with prescribed amounts of collateral.\nCovered transactions include, among other\nthings, extensions of credit, guarantees and\npurchases of assets. Section 23B generally\nrequires that transactions between a bank and\nits affiliates be on terms that are at least\nas favorable to the bank as the terms that\nwould apply in comparable transactions between\nthe bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended\nSection 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to\ninclude as a covered transaction the credit\nexposure of a bank to an affiliate arising\nfrom a derivative transaction with the\naffiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to\npropose rules to implement these revisions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve\nregulations also place quantitative\nlimitations and conditions on extensions of\ncredit by a bank to its executive officers,\ndirectors, or principal shareholders and their\nrelated interests (including any company\ncontrolled by such persons). Generally,\nextensions of credit by a bank to such\nindividuals, companies and related interests\nmust comply with certain individual and\naggregate lending limits, as well as\nprocedural and qualitative requirements. As a\nresult of the amount of PNC common stock held\nby its advised mutual funds and other\naccounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a\nprincipal shareholder of PNC Bank for\n\n8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\npurposes of these regulations. The federal\nbanking agencies have issued an interagency\nstatement addressing the application of these\ninsider lending restrictions to the other\nportfolio companies owned or controlled by the\nadvised funds and accounts of a fund complex\nthat could be considered a principal\nshareholder of a bank, which is effective the\nearlier of January 1, 2025, and the effective\ndate of a final Federal Reserve rule that\naddresses the treatment of extensions of\ncredit by a bank to fund complex-controlled\nportfolio companies that are considered\ninsiders of the bank. The statement explains\nthat the federal banking agencies will\ncontinue to exercise discretion to not take\nenforcement action against either a fund\ncomplex that is a principal shareholder of a\nbank, or a bank for which a fund complex is a\nprincipal shareholder, with respect to\nextensions of credit by the bank to the\nrelated interests of such fund complex that\notherwise would violate the insider lending\nrestrictions, subject to certain conditions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is required to establish\nstandards under the statutory provision known\nas the \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d for assessing\nwhether the amount of any interchange fee\nreceived by a debit card issuer such as PNC\nBank is reasonable and proportional to the\ncost incurred by the issuer, subject to\ncertain adjustments. The Federal Reserve\nimplemented these standards through Regulation\nII, which limits the interchange fee an issuer\nmay charge based on three components. On\nOctober 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed\nrevisions to the three components of the\ninterchange fee cap. We expect the proposed\nrule, if finalized in its current form, would\nreduce PNC Bank\u2019s interchange fee revenue.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided\nguidance regarding incentive and other\nelements of compensation provided to\nexecutives and other employees at banking\norganizations they regulate, both as general\nindustry-wide guidance and guidance specific\nto select larger companies, including PNC.\nThese guidelines are intended to ensure that\nthe incentive compensation practices of\ncovered banking organizations do not encourage\nexcessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC\nand two other regulatory agencies to adopt\nregulations governing incentive compensation\nprovided by regulated financial services\ncompanies to their executives and other\nemployees. These agencies jointly proposed\nregulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to\nimplement these requirements. Final\nregulations have not been adopted.\n\nThe trust, investment advisory and other\nfiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank\nalso are subject to the OCC\u2019s regulations\ngoverning the fiduciary activities of national\nbanks, as well as applicable state fiduciary\nlaws. The OCC\u2019s regulations, among other\nthings, set standards for the administration\nof fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern\npotential conflicts of interests and establish\nrecordkeeping requirements for fiduciary\naccounts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval is\nrequired whenever we propose to acquire all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of any bank,\nto acquire direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of any class of voting\nsecurities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or\nconsolidate with any other BHC. In reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC, the factors the Federal Reserve\nmust consider include (i) the competitive\neffects of the proposal in the relevant\ngeographic markets; (ii) the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; (iii) the effect of the\ntransaction on the financial stability of the\nU.S.; (iv) the organizations\u2019 compliance with\nAML laws and regulations; (v) the convenience\nand needs of the communities to be served; and\n(vi) the records of performance under the CRA\nof the insured depository institutions\ninvolved in the transaction. On July 9, 2021,\nPresident Biden signed an executive order\nthat, among other things, recommended that the\nU.S. Department of Justice and federal banking\nagencies update guidelines on banking mergers\nto provide more robust scrutiny of mergers.\nThe agencies have not yet published updated\nguidelines.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval also is\nrequired, and similar factors are considered,\nfor a BHC to acquire direct or indirect\nownership or control of more than 5% of any\nclass of voting securities of a savings\nassociation or savings and loan holding\ncompany, or to merge or consolidate with a\nsavings and loan holding company. In cases\ninvolving interstate bank acquisitions, the\nFederal Reserve also must consider the\nconcentration of deposits nationwide and in\ncertain individual states. A BHC is generally\nprohibited from merging or consolidating with,\nor acquiring, another company or bank if upon\nconsummation the resulting company would\ncontrol 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or\na state, or if the resulting company\u2019s\nliabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate\nliabilities of the U.S. financial sector\n(including the U.S. liabilities of foreign\nfinancial companies). In extraordinary cases,\nthe FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve, could order the break-up of financial\nfirms that are deemed to present a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\n\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to\nacquire another insured bank or savings\nassociation by merger or to acquire deposits\nor substantially all of the assets of such\ninstitutions. In deciding whether to approve\nsuch a transaction, the OCC is required to\nconsider factors similar to those that must be\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve in\nconnection with the acquisition of a bank or\nBHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is\nrequired to merge a non-bank entity into PNC\nBank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also has issued rules\ngoverning when a BHC is presumed to \u201ccontrol\u201d\nanother company for purposes of the BHC Act,\nthereby causing the company to be considered a\nsubsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The\nrules establish a set of presumptions\nidentifying when a BHC would be deemed to\ncontrol another company, with the nature and\nscope of relationships a BHC may have with a\nnon-controlled company ( e.g. , director or\nofficer representatives, scope of business\nrelationships, etc.) declining as the BHC\u2019s\nvoting ownership percentage in the company\nincreases.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                   Form 10-K 9\nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters . PNC Bank\nis insured by the FDIC and subject to deposit\npremium assessments. PNC Bank, as an insured\ndepository institution with over $50 billion\nin assets and controlled by a BHC with over\n$500 billion in assets on a consolidated\nbasis, is a \u201chighly complex institution\u201d under\nthe FDIC\u2019s methodology for determining premium\nassessments. Regulatory matters could increase\nthe cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to\nan insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance\npremiums are \u201crisk based.\u201d Therefore, higher\nfee percentages would be charged to banks that\nhave lower capital ratios or higher risk\nprofiles. These risk profiles take into\naccount, among other things, weaknesses that\nare found by the primary federal banking\nregulator through its examination and\nsupervision of the bank and the bank\u2019s\nholdings of assets or liabilities classified\nas higher risk by the FDIC, including brokered\ndeposits. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or\na bank\u2019s primary federal banking regulator\ncould increase the costs to a bank and result\nin an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher\nthan that of competing banks in a lower risk\ncategory.\n\nFollowing the bank failures in March 2023, the\nFDIC invoked the systemic risk exception to\ncertain resolution-related and Deposit\nInsurance Fund restrictions in order to fully\nprotect all depositors of the affected\ninstitutions, including uninsured deposits. By\nlaw, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund\nto support uninsured depositors under the\nsystemic risk exception must be recovered by\none or more special assessments on insured\ndepository institutions or depository\ninstitution holding companies, or both. On\nNovember 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule\nto implement the special assessment. Under the\nrule, the FDIC will collect from PNC, along\nwith other BHCs and insured depository\ninstitutions, special assessments at an annual\nrate of approximately 13.4 basis points of an\ninstitution\u2019s uninsured deposits reported as\nof December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the\nfirst $5 billion), over eight quarterly\nassessment periods, beginning after the first\nquarter of 2024. Because the losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund from the systemic risk\nexception are estimated, the FDIC will\nperiodically adjust the estimate, which could\nresult in extending the special assessment for\nadditional quarters, imposing a final special\nassessment on a one-time basis if actual\nlosses exceed the amounts collected, or cease\ncollection early if the FDIC has collected\nenough to recover actual losses. PNC expects\nnoninterest expenses related to the special\nassessment to total approximately $515 million\non a pre-tax basis and incurred this expense\nduring the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFederal banking laws and regulations also\napply a variety of requirements or\nrestrictions on insured depository\ninstitutions with respect to brokered\ndeposits. For instance, only a \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d insured depository institution\nmay accept brokered deposits without prior\nregulatory approval. In addition, brokered\ndeposits are generally subject to higher\noutflow assumptions than other types of\ndeposits for purposes of the LCR. The FDIC has\nissued rules and guidance for determining\nwhether deposits are considered \u201cbrokered.\u201d\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning . BHCs that\nhave $100 billion or more in assets, such as\nPNC, are required under section 165(d) of the\nDodd-Frank Act and its implementing\nregulations to periodically submit to the\nFederal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan\n(including a public summary) that includes,\namong other things, an analysis of how the\ncompany could be resolved in a rapid and\norderly fashion if the company were to fail or\nexperience material financial distress. The\nFederal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly\nimpose restrictions on a covered BHC,\nincluding additional capital requirements or\nlimitations on growth, if the agencies jointly\ndetermine that the company\u2019s plan is not\ncredible or would not facilitate a rapid and\norderly resolution of the company under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable\nresolution framework), and additionally could\nrequire the company to divest assets or take\nother actions if the company did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed. PNC\ngenerally must file a resolution plan with the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC at least once each\nthree-year period, with submissions\nalternating between a full plan and a plan\ntargeted on certain areas or subjects\nidentified by the agencies. The agencies,\nhowever, have reserved the ability to alter\nthe scheduled filing date for a covered\ncompany, request an interim update before a\ncovered company\u2019s next scheduled filing date\nand require a covered company to submit a full\nresolution plan in lieu of a scheduled\ntargeted plan. PNC filed a targeted resolution\nplan in December 2021 and received feedback\nfrom the agencies in December 2022 that did\nnot identify any shortcomings or deficiencies\nin PNC\u2019s plan. The agencies have extended the\ndue date of PNC\u2019s next 165(d) resolution plan\nto March 31, 2025.\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve and FDIC\nproposed new guidance for holding company\nresolution plans submitted by triennial full\nfilers such as PNC. Under the proposed\nguidance, firms like PNC with a multiple point\nof entry resolution strategy would be required\nto incorporate more severe plan assumptions\nand include new required plan content,\noperational capabilities, legal entity\nrationalization, and separability options,\namong other requirements. Additional\nrequirements would apply to BHCs that elect to\nuse a single point of entry resolution\nstrategy.\n\nThe FDIC also requires large insured\ndepository institutions, including PNC Bank,\nto periodically submit a resolution plan\n(including a public summary) to the FDIC that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the institution could be resolved under\nthe FDI Act in a manner that protects\ndepositors and limits losses or costs to\ncreditors of the bank in accordance with the\nFDI Act. PNC Bank filed its last resolution\nplan in December 2022. In August 2023, the\nFDIC proposed significant changes to its\nresolution plan rule. Under the proposed rule,\nbanks with $100 billion or more in assets,\nsuch as PNC Bank, would be required to submit\nfull resolution plans on a two-year cycle with\nan interim informational supplement and FDIC\nsupervisory activities and capabilities\ntesting between full submissions. The proposed\nrule would significantly expand the required\ncontent elements and add virtual data room and\nvaluation capabilities as significant\ncomponents of the resolution planning process.\nThe proposal would divide banks with $100\nbillion or more in assets into two future\ngroups, with one group of banks required to\nsubmit their first full resolution plan under\nthe new rule at least 270 days after the\neffective date of the final rule, and the\nother submitting full plans the following\nyear.\n\n10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines\nthat establish standards for recovery\nplanning. These guidelines require a covered\nbank to develop and maintain a recovery plan\nthat is evaluated and updated annually that,\namong other things, identifies a range of\noptions that could be undertaken by the\ncovered bank to restore its financial strength\nand viability should identified triggering\nevents occur. The recovery plan guidelines are\nenforceable in the same manner as the other\nguidelines the OCC has established.\n\nCFPB Regulation and Supervision . The CFPB\nexamines PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with\na broad range of federal consumer financial\nlaws and regulations, including the laws and\nregulations that relate to deposit products,\ncredit card, mortgage, automobile, student and\nother consumer loans, and other consumer\nfinancial products and services that we offer.\nThe consumer financial protection laws that\nare subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervision and\nenforcement powers include, among others, the\nTruth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act,\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. The CFPB\nalso has authority to take enforcement actions\nto prevent and remedy acts and practices\nrelating to consumer financial products and\nservices that it deems to be unfair, deceptive\nor abusive, and to impose new disclosure\nrequirements for any consumer financial\nproduct or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by PNC or PNC\nBank. The CFPB has engaged in rulemakings that\naffect, among other things, credit card late\nfees, overdraft fees, data collection and\nreporting requirements for small business\nlenders such as PNC Bank, and personal\nfinancial data rights.\n                                              \n  Securities and Derivatives Regulation       \n                                              \nPNC, as a public company, is subject to the\nExchange Act\u2019s reporting requirements and\nrelated regulations and must file certain\nreports with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Our\nregistered broker-dealers and investment\nadviser subsidiaries are subject to the\nExchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act\nof 1940, respectively, and related rules and\nregulations promulgated by the SEC. These\nrules, for example, require that broker-\ndealers and investment advisers act in a\ncustomer\u2019s best interest when making\ninvestment recommendations to retail\ncustomers, which includes managing conflicts\nof interest, providing required disclosures\nand exercising a duty of care in making\ninvestment recommendations. FINRA is the\nprimary self-regulatory organization for our\nregistered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our\nbroker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries also are subject to additional\nregulation by states or local jurisdictions.\n\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement\nfunctions that oversee broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers and can bring actions that\nresult in fines, restitution, a limitation on\npermitted activities, disqualification to\ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an\ninability to rely on certain favorable\nexemptions. Certain types of infractions and\nviolations also can affect our ability to\nexpeditiously issue new securities into the\ncapital markets. In addition, certain changes\nin the activities of a broker-dealer require\napproval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into\naccount a variety of considerations in acting\nupon applications for such approval, including\ninternal controls, capital levels, management\nexperience and quality, prior enforcement and\ndisciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\n\nThe CFTC regulates swap dealers, other than\nsecurity-based swap dealers, which are\nregulated by the SEC. PNC Bank is registered\nas a swap dealer with the CFTC. Because of the\nlimited volume of our security-based swap\ndealing activities, PNC Bank has not\nregistered (and currently does not intend, and\nis not required, to register) with the SEC as\na security-based swap dealer.\n\nPNC Bank\u2019s derivatives and foreign exchange\nbusinesses are subject to the regulations and\nrequirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap\ndealers, and the CFTC (and for certain\ndelegated responsibilities, the National\nFutures Association) has a meaningful\nsupervisory role with respect to PNC Bank\u2019s\nderivatives and foreign exchange businesses.\nThe CFTC\u2019s regulations are intended to (i)\naddress systemic risk issues, (ii) bring\ngreater transparency to the derivatives and\nforeign exchange markets, (iii) provide\nenhanced disclosures and protections to\ncustomers and (iv) promote market integrity.\nAmong other things, these regulations (i)\nrequire that, absent certain specified\nexemptions, most standardized swaps be\ncentrally cleared through a regulated clearing\nhouse and be traded on a centralized exchange\nor swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC\nBank to comprehensive recordkeeping,\nregulatory reporting and real-time public\nreporting requirements; (iii) subject PNC Bank\nto various business conduct requirements,\nincluding the provision of daily marks to\ncounterparties and disclosing to\ncounterparties (pre-execution) the material\nrisks, material incentives and any conflicts\nof interest associated with their swap; and\n(iv) impose special duties on PNC Bank when\ntransacting a swap with a \u201cspecial entity\u201d (\ne.g. , governmental agency (federal, state or\nlocal) or political subdivision thereof,\npension plan or endowment). Because PNC Bank\nis a prudentially regulated swap dealer, PNC\nBank is subject to the OCC\u2019s capital\nrequirements and margin requirements on\ncertain swaps that are not centrally cleared\nthrough a regulated clearing house.\n\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to\nPNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC\nswap dealer, impose compliance burdens on PNC\nBank and introduce additional legal risks\n(including as a result of applicable anti-\nfraud and anti-manipulation provisions and\nprivate rights of action). In addition,\nfailure to comply with the \u201cpay-to-play\u201d\nregulations that govern our swap and municipal\nsecurities businesses could result in\nlimitations on PNC Bank\u2019s ability to conduct\nswap and municipal securities business with\nstate or local governments and their\nauthorities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 11\n                                              \n  Regulations of Other Agencies               \n                                              \nIn addition to regulations issued by the\nfederal banking, securities and derivatives\nregulators, we also are subject to regulations\nissued by other federal agencies with respect\nto certain financial products and services we\noffer.

The racial,\nethnic and gender composition of our\nworkforce, including within executive, senior\nleader and other managerial roles, is\nreflected in our EEO-1 reports, which are\nposted on our website. As of December 31,\n2023, PNC\u2019s workforce was approximately 40.2%\nmen and 59.0% women, and 51.8% of PNC\u2019s\nemployees in managerial roles were women.\nPNC\u2019s workforce was 11.1% Hispanic or Latino,\n62.3% White, 14.8% Black or African American,\n7.0% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or other\nPacific Islander, 0.3% American Indian or\nAlaska Native, and 2.1% two or more races. In\nmanagerial roles, PNC\u2019s workforce was 9.0%\nHispanic or Latino, 70.9% White, 10.1% Black\nor African American, 6.6% Asian, 0.1% Native\nHawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.2%\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native, and 1.5% two\nor more races.\n\n\u2022 Total rewards . We are committed to\nproviding competitive compensation and\nbenefits programs as part of our overall\nstrategy to retain and recruit talent. We\ndesign our compensation and benefits programs\nto focus on three key aspects of employee\nwell-being: health, money and quality of life.\nThese programs include competitive base\nsalaries and, depending on eligibility, cash\nincentive and/or stock-based award\nopportunities, an Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan, a 401(k) Plan with employer match, a\npension plan, healthcare, life insurance and\ndisability benefits, health savings and\ndependent care flexible spending accounts,\npaid time off, paid maternity and parental\nleave, family care resources, flexible work\nschedules, a robust wellness program with\nincentives, family building benefits, employee\nassistance programs and educational\nassistance, among others. Additionally, we\nconduct pay equity analyses to determine if\nemployees are being compensated fairly and\nconsistently across roles.\n\n\u2022 Employee engagement . PNC regularly conducts\nemployee surveys to measure employee\nengagement because we believe that engaged\nemployees have lower attrition rates and\nimproved customer outcomes.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 13\n                                              \n  Climate Change Strategy                     \n                                              \nWe recognize that environmental issues, such\nas climate change, could pose significant\nfinancial, legal and reputational risk to PNC.\nWe support the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy by striving to manage our physical\nfootprint in a sustainable manner,\nincorporating climate-related risk\nconsiderations into our ERM framework,\nintegrating responsible investing strategies\ninto our investment and portfolio management\npractices, and helping clients finance their\nown sustainability goals. These tenets have\nbeen incorporated into our Climate Action\nStrategy that was formalized at the start of\n2022 to enable us to finance the transition to\na low-carbon economy. Our approach will be\niterative and flexible, highlighting five main\nareas: employee engagement; long-term\ncollaboration with stakeholders, external\npartners and industry groups; support for our\ncustomers\u2019 transition plans; executing on our\nown operational sustainability goals; and\nportfolio alignment over time, emphasizing\nclimate risk identification and management,\nand financed emissions calculations as initial\nwork sets.\n\nOur governance of climate issues seeks to\nensure an appropriate balancing of\nenvironmental considerations with other\norganizational priorities as we pursue our\npurpose of helping all of our stakeholders\nmove forward financially. PNC\u2019s Board oversees\nclimate change-related efforts. Specific\ninternal working groups, engaging with\nrelevant stakeholders within PNC, then carry\nout these efforts. In addition, we have an\nestablished risk management framework that\nhelps identify, assess, monitor and report on\nenvironmental risks, including those related\nto climate change. PNC\u2019s Climate Risk\nCommittee specifically oversees the\nintegration of climate-related risks into the\nERM Framework.\n\nWe assess climate change risks under two\ndistinct categories: transition risks and\nphysical risks. Transition risks are\nexperienced as the world moves toward a low-\ncarbon economy and becomes less reliant upon\nfossil fuels. They can be reputational in\nnature or driven by changes in the market,\ntechnology and/or policy. Because transition\nrisks are typically experienced to a greater\ndegree in the short- to medium-term, they are\ndependent upon near-term policy decisions.\nPhysical risks arise from risks associated\nwith natural perils, such as hurricanes,\nfires, floods and drought. Physical risks may\nincrease due to a changing climate, and we\nbelieve such increased risks are realized to a\ngreater degree in the medium- to long-term.\nTransition and physical risks each requires a\ndifferent risk management approach, and we\nexplore a range of possible outcomes to gain\ninsight on how to best manage these risks.\n\nFor more information on PNC\u2019s climate change-\nrelated risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors and\nthe Credit Risk Management section of this\nReport.\n                                              \n  Financial Information                       \n                                              \nWe are subject to the informational\nrequirements of the Exchange Act and, in\naccordance with the Exchange Act, we file\nannual,\n\nquarterly and current reports, proxy\nstatements and other information with the SEC.\nOur SEC File Number is 001-09718.

As a financial services company,\ncertain elements of risk are inherent in what\nwe do and the business decisions we make.\nThus, we encounter risk as part of the normal\ncourse of our business, and we design risk\nmanagement processes to help manage these\nrisks. For more information about how we\nmanage risks, see the Risk Management section\nof this Report.\n\nThe following are the material risk factors\nthat affect us of which we are currently\naware. Any one or more of these risk factors\ncould have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows. In addition, these\nrisks present other possible adverse\nconsequences, including those described below.\nThese risk factors and other risks we face are\nalso discussed further in other sections of\nthis Report. Thus, the risk factors below\nshould not be considered a complete list of\npotential risks that we may face.\n\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other\nExternal Factors, Including Regulation\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of adverse economic\nconditions.\n\nGiven the nature of our business, our business\nand overall financial performance are affected\nto a significant extent by economic\nconditions, primarily in the U.S. Declining or\nadverse economic conditions and adverse\nchanges in investor, consumer and business\nsentiment generally result in reduced business\nactivity, which may decrease the demand for\nour products and services or reduce the number\nof creditworthy borrowers. The ability of\nborrowers to repay loans is often weakened as\na result of economic downturns, higher\ninflation and unemployment. This may be\nfurther exacerbated by a deterioration in\nhouseholds\u2019 finances, particularly if\nconsumers also continue to face high\ninflation. In addition, adverse economic\nconditions, including periods of inflation,\nmay limit the availability of, or increase the\ncosts of, capital and labor, erode consumer\nand customer purchasing power, confidence and\nspending and may also reduce our tolerance for\nextending credit. Increases in costs or\nexpenses impacting our customers\u2019 operations\nand financial performance, such as the\ninterest rates payable on their debt\nobligations, could increase our credit risk or\ndecrease the demand for our products and\nservices.\n\nWe operate in an uncertain economic\nenvironment due to structural and secular\nchanges triggered by the pandemic for certain\nsectors of the economy combined with increased\ninterest rates, inflation and geopolitical\ntensions. These conditions may not abate in\nthe near term, and their continuation could\nmaterially adversely affect our operations and\nfinancial performance. Such economic\nconditions also have led and may continue to\nlead to turmoil and volatility in financial\nmarkets, often with at least some financial\nasset categories losing value. Any of these\neffects would likely have an adverse impact on\nour operations and financial performance, with\nthe significance of the impact generally\ndepending on the nature and severity of the\nadverse economic conditions.\n\nEven when economic conditions are relatively\ngood or stable, specific economic factors can\nnegatively affect our business and\nperformance. This can be especially true when\nthe factors relate to particular segments of\nthe economy. For example, as remote work\ncontinues to be a feasible alternative to pre-\npandemic in-office work arrangements, notable\nportions of available commercial real estate\nspace remain underutilized. This likely\ndecreases demand for financial services in\nthat sector and harms the creditworthiness of\nsome of our office commercial real estate\ncustomers, as well as businesses whose\ncustomers have historically been office\nworkers.\n\nGiven the geographic scope of our business and\noperations, we are most exposed to issues\nwithin the U.S. economy and financial markets.\nOur foreign business activities continue to be\na relatively small part of our overall\nbusiness. As a result, the direct impact on\nour business and financial performance from\neconomic conditions outside the U.S. is not\nlikely to be significant, although the impact\nwould increase if we expanded our foreign\nbusiness more than nominally. We are, however,\nsusceptible to the risk that foreign economic\nconditions and geopolitical tensions could\nnegatively affect our business and financial\nperformance. Primarily, this risk results from\nthe possibility that poor economic conditions\nor financial market disruptions affecting\nother major economies would also affect the\nU.S.\n\nThroughout the remainder of this Risk Factors\nsection, we address specific ways in which\neconomic issues could create risk for us and\nresult in adverse impacts on our business and\nfinancial performance.\n\nThe impact of government legislation,\nregulation and policy and other political\nfactors on the economy could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial\nperformance.\n\nChanges in law or governmental policy\naffecting the economy, business activity, or\npersonal spending, investing or saving\nactivities may cause consumers and businesses\nto alter their behavior in ways that impact\ndemand for our products and services. Such\nchanges may also alter the profitability of\nthe transactions in which we engage or result\nin increased regulatory burden and associated\ncosts. PNC may alter the types or terms of the\nproducts and services we offer to reflect such\nchanges. Uncertainty regarding future law or\npolicy may have similar impacts. In addition,\nthe application of some laws may be uncertain,\nrequire significant judgment and be\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nsubject to differing interpretations. Congress\nand the agencies that regulate us have changed\nand may continue to change the laws and\npolicies that are applicable to us, including\ntheir interpretations of rules and guidelines,\nwhich has subjected and may continue to\nsubject financial institutions like us to\nheightened levels of regulation and\nsupervision and more stringent enforcement and\npotentially severe penalties. For example, the\nincreased time frames and difficulty in\nobtaining regulatory approvals for\nacquisitions and other activities could affect\nour ability to make acquisitions or introduce\nnew products and services. As another example,\ntax laws and tax rates may be subject to\nsignificant change and an increase in our\neffective tax rates could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operation and financial\ncondition. In addition, these changes may\nadversely impact our operations or financial\ncondition as discussed in more detail in the\nRisk Factor headed \u201cAs a regulated financial\nservices firm, we are subject to numerous\ngovernmental regulations and comprehensive\noversight by a variety of regulatory agencies\nand enforcement authorities. These regulations\nand their implementation can have a\nsignificant impact on our businesses and\noperations and our ability to grow and\nexpand.\u201d\n\nConcern regarding the ability of Congress and\nthe President collectively to reach agreement\non federal budgetary matters (including the\ndebt ceiling), or prolonged stalemates leading\nto total or partial governmental shutdowns,\nalso can have adverse economic consequences\nand create the risk of economic instability or\nmarket volatility, with potential adverse\nconsequences to our business and financial\nperformance. Divided control of the U.S.\ngovernment increases concern over the\ninability of Congress and the President to\nreach necessary agreements and make government\nshutdowns or defaults in government\nobligations more likely.\n\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other\ngovernmental agencies have a significant\nimpact on interest rates and overall financial\nmarket performance, which are important to our\nbusiness and financial performance.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve,\nincluding changes in the federal funds rate,\nopen market operations and balance sheet\nmanagement, have a significant impact on\ninterest rates, the value of financial\ninstruments and other assets and liabilities,\nand overall financial market performance and\nvolatility. These policies can thus affect the\nactivities and results of operations of\nfinancial companies such as PNC. An important\nfunction of the Federal Reserve is to monitor\nthe national supply of bank credit and set\ncertain interest rates. The actions of the\nFederal Reserve influence the rates of\ninterest that we charge on loans and that we\npay on borrowings and interest-bearing\ndeposits. Rates of interest can also affect\nthe value of our on-balance sheet and off-\nbalance sheet financial instruments. Since\n2022, the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative\ntightening and increases in benchmark rates to\nreduce high rates of inflation has and may\ncontinue to adversely affect the value of\nfinancial instruments and other assets and\nliabilities, including securities and\ninterest-bearing deposits, impact borrowers,\nincrease market volatility and result in a\nflattening or inversion of the yield curve. In\naddition, actions by governmental authorities\nin other countries, including with respect to\nmonetary policy, could impact financial\nmarkets and global interest rates, which could\naffect rates in the U.S. as well as rates on\ninstruments denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar, any of which could have\npotential effects on us as described above.\n\nSome of the potential impacts on our business\nand results of governmental monetary policy\nare described in Risk Factors under the\nheading \u201cRisks Related to the Business of\nBanking.\u201d\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are\nsubject to numerous governmental regulations\nand comprehensive oversight by a variety of\nregulatory agencies and enforcement\nauthorities. These regulations and their\nimplementation can have a significant impact\non our businesses and operations and our\nability to grow and expand.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a\nBHC and a financial holding company, with the\nFederal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC\nBank is a federally chartered bank, with the\nOCC as its primary regulator. In addition, our\nbusinesses are subject to regulation by\nmultiple other banking, consumer protection,\nsecurities and derivatives regulatory bodies.\nWe are also subject to the jurisdiction of\ncriminal and civil enforcement authorities. As\na result, we are subject to numerous laws and\nregulations, with multiple regulators or\nagencies having supervisory or enforcement\noversight over aspects of our business\nactivities. These laws, regulations and\nsupervisory activities are intended to promote\nthe safety and soundness of financial\ninstitutions, financial market stability, the\ntransparency and liquidity of financial\nmarkets, consumer protection and to prevent\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing and\nare not primarily intended to protect PNC\nsecurity holders. In addition to regulation in\nthe U.S., we are also subject to foreign\nregulation to a limited extent as a result of\nour business activities outside the U.S.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our\npermissible activities and investments and\nrequire compliance with provisions designed to\nprotect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary,\nand other customers, and for the protection of\ncustomer information, among other things. We\nalso are subject to laws and regulations\ndesigned to combat money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and transactions with persons,\ncompanies or foreign governments designated by\nU.S. authorities. Over time, the scope of the\nlaws and regulations affecting our businesses,\nas well as the number of requirements or\nlimitations imposed by legislative or\nregulatory actions, has increased, and we\nexpect to continue to face substantial\nregulatory oversight and new or revised\nregulatory requirements or initiatives.\nLegislative or regulatory actions have\nresulted and will likely continue to result in\nincreased compliance costs, reduced business\nopportunities, or requirements and limitations\non how we conduct our business. In particular,\nthe financial services industry continues to\nface heightened scrutiny, including with\nrespect to BSA and AML compliance\nrequirements, consumer compliance and\nprotection matters (such as with respect to\noverdraft and other fees), and capital,\nliquidity and resolution planning in response\nto turmoil in the banking\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 17\nindustry in early 2023. In addition,\nheightened standards under proposed and\nrecently finalized rules, such as those\nimplementing the Community Reinvestment Act,\nmay result in increased obligations and\ncompliance costs, and may factor into our\nability to expand and engage in new actions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a\nsource of financial and managerial strength\nfor its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve\ncould require PNC to commit resources to PNC\nBank when doing so is not otherwise in the\ninterests of PNC or its shareholders or\ncreditors.\n\nFederal law grants substantial supervisory and\nenforcement powers to federal banking\nregulators, and they have assumed an active\noversight, examination and enforcement role\nacross the financial services industry. The\nresults of supervisory or examination\nactivities by our regulators, including actual\nor perceived compliance failures, could result\nin limitations on our ability to enter into\ncertain transactions, engage in new\nactivities, expand geographically, make\nacquisitions or obtain necessary regulatory\napprovals in connection therewith, or\notherwise require us to modify our businesses\npractices in a manner that materially impacts\nour financial condition or results of\noperations. These activities also could result\nin significant fines, penalties or required\ncorrective actions, some of which could be\nexpensive and difficult to implement. In\naddition, another financial institution\u2019s\nviolation of law or regulation may give rise\nto an investigation of the same or similar\nactivities of PNC.\n\nAs we expand our product and service offerings\ninto additional markets, domestic or foreign,\neither through organic growth or acquisition,\nwe have faced and will continue to face\nincreases in state or foreign regulation\naffecting our operations. Different approaches\nto regulation by different jurisdictions,\nincluding potentially conflicting state-level\nregulation, could materially increase our\ncompliance costs or risks of non-compliance.\n\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate\npolicies and procedures designed to comply,\nwith regulatory requirements and expectations\nexposes us to the risk of damages, fines and\nregulatory penalties and other regulatory or\nenforcement actions or consequences, such as\nlimitations on activities otherwise\npermissible for us or additional requirements\nfor engaging in new activities and could also\ninjure our reputation with customers and\nothers with whom we do business. We also rely\non third parties who may expose us to\ncompliance risk. A failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements or deficiencies in\nrisk management practices could be\nincorporated in our confidential supervisory\nratings, which could limit PNC\u2019s ability to\nexpand or require additional approvals before\nengaging in certain business activities.\n\nSee the immediately following Risk Factor for\na discussion of risks associated with capital\nand liquidity regulation. Also see the\nSupervision and Regulation section of this\nReport and Note 19 Regulatory Matters for more\ninformation concerning the regulation of PNC,\nincluding those areas that have been receiving\na high level of regulatory focus.\n\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect our business,\noperations and ability to pay dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements established\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nrespectively. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the Basel\nCommittee and then applied, with adjustments,\nin each country by the appropriate domestic\nregulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory\nagencies can apply stricter capital and\nliquidity standards than those developed by\nthe Basel Committee. In several instances, the\nU.S. banking agencies have done so with\nrespect to U.S. banking organizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity, and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of our capital\nand liquidity, impact our business activities\nand may prevent us from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force us to take actions\ncontrary to their interests. For example,\nPNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders is\nsubject to PNC\u2019s compliance with its SCB,\nwhich is determined at least annually through\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. The\nFederal Reserve can also impose additional\nlimitations on capital distributions, such as\nthe limitations on distributions imposed in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic and the\n2007-2008 financial crisis. In addition,\ndividends from PNC Bank and, to a lesser\nextent, non-bank subsidiaries are PNC\u2019s\nprincipal source of funds to, among other\nthings, pay dividends on and make repurchases\nof its capital stock. Many of our subsidiaries\nare subject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to\nprohibit or limit dividends to PNC.\nLimitations on PNC\u2019s ability to receive\ndividends from its subsidiaries, including PNC\nBank, could have a material adverse effect on\nits liquidity and ability to pay dividends on\nand make repurchases of its capital stock,\nespecially to the extent that PNC must first\nservice any outstanding debt obligations.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements may also\nimpact the amount and type of loans we make.\nWe may be constrained in our ability to\nexpand, either organically or through\nacquisitions. We may be forced to sell or\nrefrain from acquiring assets where the\ncapital requirements appear inconsistent with\nthe assets\u2019 underlying risks. In addition,\nliquidity standards require us to maintain\nholdings of highly liquid short-term\ninvestments, thereby reducing our ability to\ninvest in longer-term or less liquid assets,\neven if more desirable from an earnings,\nbalance sheet or interest rate risk management\nperspective.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nare subject to regular review and revision by\nthe Basel Committee and the U.S. banking\nagencies. In July 2023, the Federal Reserve,\nOCC, and FDIC proposed for public comment a\nrule to implement the final components of the\nBasel III framework that would significantly\nrevise the capital requirements for large\nbanking organizations, including PNC and PNC\nBank. We expect the proposal, if finalized in\nits current form, would result in lower\nregulatory capital ratios for PNC and PNC\nBank, which would likely increase the risk of\nsome of the potential adverse effects\ndescribed above.\n\nThe regulatory capital and liquidity\nframeworks, as well as certain other\nprudential requirements and standards that are\napplicable to PNC, including related proposed\nrules, are discussed in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of this Report and the\nLiquidity and Capital Management portion of\nthe Risk Management section of this Report.\n\nOur ability to operate our business could be\nimpaired if our liquidity is unexpectedly\nconstrained.\n\nOur liquidity could be impaired as a result of\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral,\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher\nthan anticipated draws on lending-related\ncommitments, an inability to sell assets (or\nto sell assets at favorable times or prices),\na default by a counterparty or other market\nparticipant, our inability to access other\nsources of liquidity, including through the\ncapital markets due to unforeseen market\ndislocations or interruptions, or a lack of\nmarket or customer confidence in PNC or\nfinancial institutions in general. Many of the\nabove conditions and factors may be caused by\nevents over which we have little or no\ncontrol. The increased speed with which\ninformation is disseminated, through official\nor social media, could increase the speed or\nseverity of liquidity pressures caused by, for\nexample, negative news about PNC\u2019s or other\nfinancial institutions\u2019 financial prospects or\nsafety and soundness. A negative impact on our\nliquidity would likely limit our ability to\nsupport our operations and fund outstanding\nliabilities as well as meet regulatory\nexpectations, which would adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nFor information on our liquidity management,\nsee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nReport.\n\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly impact our liquidity, funding\ncosts and access to the capital markets.\n\nOur credit ratings are based on a number of\nfactors, including the financial strength of\nPNC and PNC Bank, and factors outside of our\ncontrol, such as conditions affecting the\nfinancial services industry generally.\nReductions in one or more of our credit\nratings could adversely affect our ability to\nborrow funds and increase our cost of capital\nand limit the number of investors or\ncounterparties willing to do business with or\nlend to us. For example, downgrades could\nnegatively impact our right to continue to\nservice mortgages and hold related escrows and\nreserves. Downgrades could also adversely\naffect our ability to attract or retain\ncustomers, including deposits. In addition, a\ndowngrade in our credit ratings could trigger\nobligations to make cash or collateral\npayments under derivative contracts with\ncertain counterparties. There can be no\nassurance that we will maintain our current\nratings and outlooks. For information on our\ncredit ratings, see the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Report.\n\nPrivacy and consumer data rights initiatives\nhave imposed and will continue to impose\nadditional operational burdens on PNC, and\nthey may limit our ability to pursue desirable\nbusiness initiatives and increase the risks\nassociated with any future use of personal\ndata.\n\nOver time, there has been an increase in\nlegislative and regulatory efforts to protect\nthe privacy and enhance the portability of\npersonal data, including enhanced data privacy\nlaws regulating the use of health and\nbiometric data. Individuals whose personal\ninformation may be protected by law may\ninclude our customers, prospective customers,\njob applicants, employees and third parties.\nThese initiatives, among other things, limit\nhow companies can use personal data and impose\nobligations on companies in their management\nof such data, including requiring companies\nlike PNC to make available to consumers and\nauthorized third parties certain data relating\nto transactions and accounts and establishing\nobligations for accessing such data. Financial\nservices companies such as PNC necessarily\ngather, maintain and use a significant amount\nof personal data. These types of initiatives\nincrease compliance complexity and related\ncosts, may result in significant financial\npenalties for compliance failures, and may\nlimit our ability to develop new products or\nrespond to technological changes. This is\nparticularly true as we continue to expand our\nbusiness into new markets. We are, or may\nbecome, subject to regularly evolving and\ndeveloping data privacy and data security laws\nand regulations in other jurisdictions,\nincluding certain foreign jurisdictions even\nwhere our presence in such jurisdictions is\nminimal. Such legal requirements also could\nheighten the reputational impact of perceived\nmisuses of personal data by us, our vendors or\nothers who gain unauthorized access to our\npersonal data. Other jurisdictions may adopt\nsimilar requirements that impose different and\npotentially inconsistent compliance burdens.\nThe impacts will be greater to the extent\nrequirements vary across jurisdictions.\n\nClimate change-related risks could adversely\naffect our business and performance, including\nindirectly through impacts on our customers.\n\nThere continues to be concern, including on\nthe part of our regulators, regarding climate\nchange and its impacts over the short-,\nmedium- and long-term horizons. These concerns\nover the anticipated and unanticipated impacts\nof climate change (including physical risk and\ntransition risk) have led and will continue to\nlead to governmental efforts to mitigate those\nimpacts. We and our customers\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 19\nmay face cost increases, asset value\nreductions, the reduced availability of\ninsurance, operations disruptions and changes\nand the like because of climate change\n(including because of the increased frequency\nor severity of acute weather events and long-\nterm shifts in the climate) and governmental\nactions or societal responses to climate\nchange. The impact on our customers will\nlikely vary depending on their specific\nattributes, including their reliance on or\nrole in carbon intensive activities and their\ntransition plans, as well as their exposure to\nthe effects of climate change. Consumers and\nbusinesses are also changing their behaviors\nbecause of these concerns. Changed consumer\nand business behavior because of climate\nchange concerns creates transition risk for\nPNC arising from the process of adjusting to\nthese concerns. PNC and its customers will\nneed to respond to new laws and regulations as\nwell as consumer and business preferences as a\nresult. Among the impacts to PNC could be a\ndrop in demand for our products and services,\nparticularly in certain sectors if our\nproducts or services do not support the\nenvironmental goals of our customers, or\nincreased losses due to the impact of climate\nchange on the collateral that secures customer\nborrowings. In addition, we could face\nreductions in creditworthiness on the part of\nsome customers or in the value of assets\nsecuring loans.\n\nWe are currently subject to climate-related\nregulatory expectations and could be subject\nto additional regulatory restrictions or costs\nassociated with providing products or services\nto certain companies or sectors. Environmental\nregulations or changes in the supply, demand\nor available sources of energy or other\nresources may affect the availability or cost\nof goods and services necessary to run our\nbusiness. Our efforts to take these risks into\naccount in making lending and other decisions\nmay not be effective in protecting us from the\nnegative impact of new laws and regulations or\nchanges in consumer or business behavior,\nincluding those resulting from activist\npressure. Our risk management needs to\ncontinue to evolve, or it may not be effective\nin identifying, measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling climate risk exposure,\nparticularly given that the timing, nature and\nseverity of the impacts of climate change may\nnot be predictable.\n\nWe also have been and may continue to be\nsubject to conflicting pressure from\nindividuals, groups and/or governmental\nentities to cease doing business, or to\nmaintain business, with certain companies or\nsectors, in particular those involved with\nfossil fuels, because of concerns related to\nclimate change. Further, there is increased\nscrutiny of climate change-related policies,\ngoals and disclosures, which could result in\nlitigation and regulatory investigations and\nactions. Our stakeholders may disagree with\nthese policies and goals or, conversely,\nbelieve that these policies and goals are, and\nour related progress in accomplishing such\ngoals and implementing such policies is,\ninsufficient. This may lead to a decrease in\ndemand for our products and services or damage\nto our reputation. We may also incur\nadditional costs and require additional\nresources as we evolve our strategy, practices\nand related disclosures with respect to these\nmatters. In addition, there are and will\ncontinue to be challenges related to\ncapturing, verifying, analyzing and disclosing\nclimate-related data that is subject to\nmeasurement uncertainties. The Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact\non our business due to damage to our\nreputation\u201d further discusses risks associated\nwith our management of these matters,\nincluding related activist pressure.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Use of Technology      \n                                              \nThe use of technology is critical to our\nability to maintain or enhance the\ncompetitiveness of our businesses.\n\nAs a large financial services company, we\nhandle a substantial volume of customer and\nother financial transactions. As a result, we\nrely heavily on information systems to conduct\nour business and to process, record, monitor\nand report on our transactions and those of\nour customers. Over time, we have seen more\ncustomer usage of technological solutions for\nfinancial needs as well as higher expectations\nof customers and regulators regarding\neffective and safe systems operation. In many\ncases, the effective use of technology\nincreases efficiency and enables financial\ninstitutions to better serve customers. As a\nresult of these factors, the financial\nservices industry continues to undergo rapid\ntechnological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services. Examples include\nexpanded use of cloud computing, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, biometric\nauthentication, voice and natural language,\ndata protection enhancements and increased\nonline and mobile device interaction with\ncustomers, including innovative ways that\ncustomers can view, access and aggregate\nfinancial data, make payments or manage their\naccounts.\n\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer\nbehavior and expectations, as well as\ncompetitive pressures, we have been investing\nin technology and connectivity. We are seeking\nto automate functions previously performed\nmanually, facilitate the ability of customers\nto engage in financial transactions and\notherwise enhance the customer experience with\nrespect to our products and services. This\neffort has involved and is likely to continue\nto involve the expenditure of considerable\namounts of funds and other resources, which\ncould be constrained to the extent that\nsustained adverse economic conditions and\nother factors described elsewhere in these\nRisk Factors negatively impact our business or\nfinancial performance. A failure to maintain\nor enhance our competitive position with\nrespect to technology, whether because we fail\nto anticipate customer expectations, because\nour technological developments fail to perform\nas desired or are not rolled out in a timely\nmanner, or because we fail to keep pace with\nour competitors, would likely cause us to lose\nmarket share or incur additional expense. Our\nability to maintain or enhance our relative\ntechnological position is in part dependent on\nour ability to attract and retain talented\nemployees in these fields, which, due to\noverall demand, is increasingly difficult.\n\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nOur use of technology is dependent on having\nthe right to use its underlying intellectual\nproperty.\n\nIn some cases, we develop internally the\nintellectual property embedded in the\ntechnology we use. In others, we or our\nvendors license the use of intellectual\nproperty from others. Where we rely on access\nto third-party intellectual property, it may\nnot be available to us on commercially\nreasonably terms or at all. Regardless of the\nsource of the intellectual property, if\nanother person or entity were deemed to own\nintellectual property rights infringed by our\nactivities, we could be responsible for\nsignificant damages covering past activities\nand substantial fees to continue to engage in\nthese types of activities. It also is possible\nthat we could be prevented from using\ntechnology important to our business for at\nleast some period of time. In such\ncircumstances, there may be no alternative\ntechnology for us to use or an appropriate\nalternative technology might be expensive to\nobtain. Protections offered by those from whom\nwe license technology against these risks may\nbe inadequate to cover any losses in full.\nOver time, there have been and continue to be\ninstances where technology used by PNC has\nbeen alleged to have infringed patents held by\nothers, and, in some cases, we have suffered\nrelated losses.\n\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from\ninterruptions in the effective operation of\nour information systems and other technology.\n\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and\nresiliency of our information systems and\nother technology has become more important and\nmore challenging, and the costs involved in\nthat effort continue to be high. Our ability\nto create, obtain, maintain and report on\ninformation in an accurate, timely and secure\nmanner is a foundational component of our\nbusiness. Effective management of our expanded\ndigital products and services, geographic\nfootprint and continued remote work\nenvironment heightens our need for secure,\nreliable and adequate information systems and\ntechnology. The risks of operational failures\nin the use of these systems result from a\nvariety of factors. We are vulnerable to the\nimpact of failures of our systems to operate\nas needed or intended. Failures leading to\nmaterially adverse impacts could include those\nresulting from human error, unexpected\ntransaction volumes, or overall security,\ndesign or performance issues. In addition, our\nability to use our technology effectively\ncould be impacted due to electrical or\ntelecommunications outages, bad weather,\ndisasters, bad actors, terrorism and the like.\nSuch events could affect our systems directly\nor limit our ability to use our technology due\nto effects on key underlying infrastructure.\nAlthough we regularly update and replace\nsystems that we depend on as our needs evolve\nand technology improves, we continue to\nutilize some older systems that may not be as\nreliable as newer ones. In addition, the\nimplementation of and transition to new or\nupdated systems creates risks related to\nassociated timing and costs, disruptions in\nfunctionality for customers and longer-term\nfailures to achieve desired improvements. In\nsome cases, the risk results from the\npotential for bad acts on the part of others,\ndiscussed in more detail in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cWe are vulnerable to the risk of\nbreaches of data security affecting the\nfunctioning of systems or the confidentiality\nof information that could adversely affect our\ncustomers and our business.\u201d\n\nWe also rely on information systems maintained\nby other companies. We use other companies\nboth to provide products and services directly\nto us and to assist us in providing products\nand services to our customers. Others provide\nthe infrastructure that supports, for example,\ncommunications, payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems, or information processing\nand storage. These companies range from those\nproviding highly sophisticated information\nprocessing to those that provide fundamental\nservices, such as electric power and\ntelecommunications. In some cases, these other\ncompanies themselves utilize third parties to\nsupport their delivery of products and\nservices to us and our customers. Systems\nmaintained by or for these other companies are\ngenerally subject to many of the same risks we\nface with respect to our systems and thus\ntheir issues could have a negative impact on\nPNC. We necessarily have less ability to\nprovide oversight over other companies\u2019\ninformation systems.\n\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or\nsecurity breach of any of our information or\ncommunications systems, or the systems of\nother companies on which we rely, could result\nin a wide variety of adverse consequences to\nus. This risk is greater if the issue is\nwidespread, extends for a significant period\nof time, or results in financial losses to our\ncustomers. The consequences of failures to\noperate systems properly can result in\ndisruptions to our critical business\noperations, including our ability to use our\naccounting, deposit, loan, payment and other\nsystems. Such events could also cause errors\nin transactions or impair system functionality\nwith customers, vendors or other parties.\nPossible adverse consequences also include\ndamage to our reputation or a loss of customer\nbusiness, which could occur even if the\nnegative impact on customers was de minimis.\nWe also could face litigation or additional\nregulatory scrutiny. This in turn could lead\nto liability or other sanctions, including\nfines and penalties or reimbursement of\nadversely affected customers. Even if we do\nnot suffer any material adverse consequences\nas a result of events affecting us directly,\ninformation systems issues at other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a general loss of\ncustomer confidence in financial institutions,\nincluding us. Also, system problems, including\nthose resulting from third-party attacks,\nwhether at PNC or at our competitors, may\nbroadly increase legislative, regulatory and\ncustomer concerns regarding the functioning,\nsafety and security of such systems. In that\ncase, we would expect to incur even higher\nlevels of costs with respect to prevention and\nmitigation of these risks.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 21\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of breaches of\ndata security affecting the functioning of\nsystems or the confidentiality of information\nthat could adversely affect our customers and\nour business.\n\nMost corporate and commercial financial\ntransactions are now handled electronically,\nand our commercial and retail customers\nincreasingly use online access as well as\nmobile and cloud technologies to bank with us.\nThe ability to conduct business with us in\nthis manner depends on the transmission and\nstorage of confidential information in\nelectronic form. As a result, in the ordinary\ncourse of business, we maintain and process\nvast amounts of digital information about us,\nour customers and our employees. This\ninformation tends to be confidential or\nproprietary and much of it is highly\nsensitive. Such highly sensitive information\nincludes information sufficient to support\nidentity theft and personal health\ninformation, as well as information regarding\nbusiness plans and financial performance that\nhas not been made public. As a result, efforts\nby bad actors to engage in various types of\ncyber attacks pose serious risks to our\nbusiness and reputation.\n\nWe are faced with ongoing, nearly continual,\nefforts by others to breach data security at\nfinancial institutions or with respect to\nfinancial transactions. These efforts may be\nto obtain access to confidential or\nproprietary information, often with the intent\nof stealing from or defrauding us or our\ncustomers, or to disrupt our ability to\nconduct our business, including by destroying\nor impairing access to information maintained\nby us. Some of these involve efforts to enter\nour systems directly by going through or\naround our security protections. Others\ninvolve the use of social engineering schemes\nto gain access to confidential information\nfrom our employees, customers or vendors. Our\nrisk and exposure to data security breaches is\nheightened because of our expanded digital\nproducts and services, geographic footprint\nand continued remote work environment, which\nresults in more access points to our network.\n\nThe same risks are presented by attacks\npotentially affecting information held by\nthird parties on our behalf or accessed by\nthird parties, including those offering\nfinancial applications, on behalf of our\ncustomers. These risks also arise to the\nextent that third parties with whom we do\nbusiness, or their vendors or other entities\nwith whom they do business, are themselves\nsubject to breaches and attacks, which may\nimpact our systems or operations. Our ability\nto protect confidential or proprietary\ninformation is even more limited with respect\nto information held by these parties. For\nexample, we are likely to be limited in our\nability to identify and quickly resolve\nbreaches and attacks that may impact our\nbusiness the further removed an entity is from\nour business, such as when a breach or attack\noccurs at vendors of our vendors. We may\nsuffer reputational damage or legal liability\nfor unauthorized access to customer\ninformation held by other parties, even if we\nwere not responsible for preventing such\naccess and had no reasonable way of preventing\nit.\n\nOur customers often use their own devices,\nsuch as computers, smartphones and tablets, to\ndo business with us and may provide their PNC\ncustomer information (including passwords) to\na third party in connection with obtaining\nservices from that third party, including\nthose offering financial applications.\nAlthough we take steps to provide safety and\nsecurity for our customers\u2019 transactions with\nus and their customer information, to the\nextent they utilize their own devices or\nprovide third parties access to their\naccounts, our ability to assure such safety\nand security is necessarily limited. These\nrisks are heightened as we and others continue\nto expand mobile applications, cloud\nsolutions, and other internet-based financial\nproduct offerings. For example, a number of\nour customers choose to use financial\napplications that allow them to view, access\nand aggregate banking and other financial\naccount information, often held at different\nfinancial institutions, on a single platform,\nto monitor the performance of their\ninvestments, to compare financial and\ninvestment products, to make payments or\ntransfer funds, and otherwise to help manage\ntheir finances and investments. Financial\napplications often ask users to provide their\nsecure banking log-in information and\ncredentials so the applications can link to\nusers\u2019 accounts at financial institutions.\nCompanies offering these applications\nfrequently use third-party data aggregators,\nwhich are behind-the-scenes technology\ncompanies that serve as data-gathering service\nproviders, to deliver customer financial data\nthat is then used by the financial\napplications. To do this, data aggregators\nfrequently are provided with customers\u2019 log-in\ninformation and credentials, which allow the\naggregators to access the customers\u2019 online\naccounts and \u201cscrape\u201d the customers\u2019 data,\noften on a daily or even more frequent basis.\nThat same information has the potential to\nfacilitate fraud if it is not properly\nprotected. This has resulted in incidences of\nfraud, including automated clearing house\nfraud, credit card fraud, and wire fraud,\nenabled through the use of synthetic\nidentities and through account takeovers via\nthese platforms. In addition, transactions by\ncustomers on financial applications that\nfacilitate payments and fund transfers have\nalso been fraudulently induced. These\ntransactions occur when a customer authorizes\npayment to a recipient that fraudulently\ninduced the customer into transferring a\npayment to such recipient. PNC has and may\ncontinue to face increased financial exposure\ndue to activity associated with the increased\nuse of these applications and data\naggregators. Even where PNC does not have\nfinancial exposure for losses, PNC could\nsuffer increased reputational harm when such\nlosses occur.\n\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued\ncredit and debit cards to pay for transactions\nwith retailers and other businesses, there is\nalso the risk of data security breaches at\nthose other businesses covering PNC account\ninformation. When our customers use PNC-issued\ncards to make purchases from those businesses,\ncard account information often is provided to\nsuch businesses. If a business\u2019s systems that\nprocess or store card account information are\nsubject to a data security breach, holders of\nour cards who have made purchases from that\nbusiness may experience fraud on their card\naccounts. We can be responsible for\nreimbursing our customers for such fraudulent\ntransactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as\nwell as for other costs related to data\nsecurity compromise events, such as replacing\ncards associated with compromised card\naccounts. In addition, we provide card\ntransaction processing services to some\nmerchant customers under agreements we have\nwith payment networks such as Visa and\nMastercard. Under these agreements, we may\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nbe responsible for certain losses and\npenalties if one of our merchant customers\nsuffers a data security breach. Moreover, to\nthe extent more consumer confidential\ninformation becomes available to bad actors\nthrough the cumulative effect of data breaches\nat companies generally, bad actors may find it\neasier to use such information to gain access\nto our customer accounts.\n\nOther cyber attacks are not focused on gaining\naccess to credit card or user credential\ninformation, but instead seek access to a\nrange of other types of confidential\ninformation, such as internal emails and other\nforms of customer financial information, and\nthis information may be used to support a\nransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have\nsought to deny access to data and possibly\nshut down systems and devices maintained by\ntarget companies. In a ransomware attack,\nsystem data is encrypted, stolen or extorted,\nor access is otherwise denied, accompanied by\na demand for ransom to restore access to the\ndata or to prevent public disclosure of\nconfidential information. Attacks have also\nbeen conducted through business email\ncompromise scams that involve using social\nengineering to cause employees to wire funds\nto the perpetrators in the mistaken belief\nthat the requests were made by a company\nexecutive or established vendor. These types\nof phishing attacks have increased over time,\nand they have evolved to include other types\nof attacks like vishing (through voice\nmessages) and smishing (through SMS text).\nOther attacks have included distributed denial\nof service cyber attacks, in which individuals\nor organizations flood commercial websites\nwith extraordinarily high volumes of traffic\nwith the goal of disrupting the ability of\ncommercial enterprises to process transactions\nand possibly making their websites unavailable\nto customers for extended periods of time.\nSimilarly, attacks have been conducted through\napplication program interfaces where cyber\nattackers seek to exploit the interfaces\nbetween mobile or web applications. We (as\nwell as other financial services companies)\nhave been subject to such attacks. Recent\ncyber attacks have also included the insertion\nof malware into software updates and the\ninfection of software while it is under\nassembly, known as a \u201csupply chain attack.\u201d\nAttacks on our customers may put these\nrelationships at risk, particularly if\ncustomers\u2019 ability to continue operations is\nimpaired due to the losses suffered.\n\nThe techniques used in cyber attacks change\nrapidly and are increasingly sophisticated,\nincluding through the use of generative\nartificial intelligence and deepfakes, and we\nexpect in the future through the use of\nquantum computing, and we may not be able to\nanticipate cyber attacks or data security\nbreaches.\n\nIn addition to threats from external sources,\ninsider threats represent a significant risk\nto us. Insiders, including those having\nlegitimate access to our systems and the\ninformation contained in them, have the\neasiest opportunity to make inappropriate use\nof the systems and information. Addressing\nthat risk requires understanding not only how\nto protect us from unauthorized use and\ndisclosure of data, but also how to engage\nbehavioral analytics and other tools to\nidentify potential internal threats before any\ndamage is done. In addition, due to the\nincrease in the number of employees who work\nremotely, the opportunity for insiders to\ngrant access to third parties or to disclose\nconfidential information of PNC or its\ncustomers has increased. As more work is\nconducted outside of PNC\u2019s facilities, the\nrisk of improper access to PNC\u2019s network or\nconfidential information has increased,\nincluding for reasons such as a failure by an\nemployee or contractor to secure a device with\nPNC access.\n\nWe have been and expect to continue to be the\ntarget of some of these types of cyber\nattacks. To date, none of these types of cyber\nattacks has had a material impact on us.\nNonetheless, we cannot entirely block efforts\nby bad actors to harm us, and there can be no\nassurance that future cyber attacks will not\nbe material. While we maintain insurance\ncoverage that may cover certain aspects of\ncyber risks, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses. As a result,\nwe could suffer material financial and\nreputational losses in the future from any of\nthese or other types of attacks or the public\nperception that such an attack on our systems\nhas been successful, whether or not this\nperception is correct. Attacks on others, some\nof which have led to serious adverse\nconsequences, demonstrate the risks posed by\nnew and evolving types of cyber attacks.\n\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk\nof failures or breaches occurring in our\ninformation systems and to mitigate the impact\nwhen they do.\n\nWe have policies, procedures and systems\n(including cybersecurity and business\ncontinuity programs) designed to prevent or\nlimit the effect of possible failures,\ninterruptions or breaches in security of\ninformation systems. We continue to devote\nappropriate resources toward improving the\nreliability of our systems and their security\nagainst external and internal threats and\nexpect to continue to do so in the future. We\ndesign our business continuity and other\ninformation and technology risk management\nprograms to allow us to provide services in\nthe case of an event resulting in material\ndisruptions of business activities affecting\nour employees, facilities, technology or\nsuppliers. We cannot guarantee the\neffectiveness of our policies, procedures and\nsystems to protect us in any future situation,\nnor the effectiveness of our oversight of risk\nat third parties. Although we have policies,\nprocedures and systems designed to mitigate\nthird-party risk, our ability to implement\npolicies, procedures and systems designed to\nprevent or limit the effect of possible\nfailures, interruptions or breaches in\nsecurity of information systems with respect\nto third-party systems and the financial\nservices industry infrastructure is\nnecessarily limited. Should an adverse event\naffecting another company\u2019s systems occur, we\nmay not have financial protection from the\nother company sufficient to compensate us or\notherwise protect us from the consequences.\n\nMethods used by others to attack information\nsystems change frequently (with generally\nincreasing sophistication). A new method of\nattack often is not recognized until launched\nagainst a target. Attacks in some cases appear\nto be supported by foreign governments or\nother well-financed entities and often\noriginate from less regulated and remote areas\naround the world. We have seen a higher volume\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 23\nand complexity of attacks during times of\nincreased geopolitical tensions. As a result,\nwe may be unable to implement adequate\npreventive measures to address these methods\nin advance of attacks.\n\nEven with our proactive and defensive measures\nin place, adverse events are likely to occur,\nand there remains the risk that one or more\nsuch events would be material to PNC. Our\nability to mitigate the adverse consequences\nof such occurrences is in part dependent on\nthe quality of our business continuity\nplanning, our ability to identify and\nunderstand threats to us from a holistic\nperspective, our ability to anticipate the\ntiming and nature of any such event that\noccurs, with novel or unusual events posing a\ngreater risk, and our ability to identify and\nquickly resolve vulnerabilities in our\ninformation systems and those of third parties\nupon which we rely. It is also the case that a\nvulnerability or an adverse event may go\nundetected for a period of time, with the\nadverse consequences likely greater the longer\nit takes to discover the problem. In many\ncases, it also depends on the preparedness and\nresponses of national or regional governments,\nincluding emergency responders, or on the part\nof other organizations and businesses with\nwhich we deal. Additionally, our failure to\ncommunicate cyber incidents appropriately to\nrelevant parties could result in regulatory,\nlegal, operational and reputational risk.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Business of Banking    \n                                              \nOur business and financial results are subject\nto risks associated with the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business. It results from, among\nother things, extending credit to customers,\npurchasing securities, and entering into\nfinancial derivative transactions and certain\nguarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our\nmost significant risks, particularly given the\nhigh percentage of our assets represented\ndirectly or indirectly by loans and securities\nand the importance of lending activity to our\noverall business. We manage credit risk by\nassessing and monitoring the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties, by\ndiversifying our loan portfolio, by obtaining\nand monitoring collateral for certain\nexposures and by investing primarily in high\nquality securities.\n\nA borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan can be\nadversely affected by many factors. Individual\nborrowers can be affected, for example, by\ndeclines in income, job losses, health issues\nor family issues. For example, the recent\nresumption in federal student loan payments\ncould impact a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a\nloan, such as a mortgage, because of the\nfinancial pressure from student loan payments.\nCommercial borrowers can be affected, for\nexample, by poor business performance, changes\nin customer behavior or catastrophic losses.\nWeakness in the economy or in financial\nmarkets typically adversely impact the ability\nof our borrowers to repay outstanding loans.\nWe are exposed to increased credit risk if we\nfail to evaluate properly at origination the\nlikely ability of a borrower to repay a loan.\nProperly estimating the current and potential\nvalue of any collateral pledged to support the\nloan also is critical to effectively managing\ncredit risk. A failure to identify declining\ncreditworthiness of a borrower or declining\ncollateral value at a time when remedial\nactions could reduce our exposure also\nincreases credit risk. Any decrease in our\nborrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans likely would\nresult in higher levels of nonperforming\nloans, net charge-offs, provision for credit\nlosses and valuation adjustments on loans held\nfor sale. Managing credit risk effectively\nalso relies on forecasts of future overall\neconomic conditions, which are inherently\nimperfect.\n\nIn addition to credit risk associated with our\nlending activities, we have credit risk\narising from many other types of business\nrelationships. Routine transactions give us\ncredit exposure to brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds, other institutional clients, as\nwell as vendors and other non-financial\nentities.\n\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when the\nvalue of collateral held by us to secure\nobligations to us cannot be realized,\nincluding because of legal or regulatory\nchanges, or is liquidated at prices that are\nnot sufficient to recover the full amount of\nthe loan or derivative exposure due to us. In\naddition, credit risk may be exacerbated when\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\n\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and\nlease portfolio through our ACL estimated\nunder CECL. Under CECL, the ACL reflects\nexpected lifetime losses, which has led and\ncould continue to lead to volatility in the\nallowance and the provision for credit losses\nas economic forecasts, actual credit\nperformance and other factors used in the loss\nestimating process change. We also have\nreserves for unfunded loan commitments and\nletters of credit. Changes to expected losses\nare reflected in net income through provision\nfor credit losses. A worsening of economic\nconditions or our economic outlook or an\nincrease in credit risk, particularly\nfollowing a period of good economic\nconditions, would likely lead to an increase\nin provision for credit losses with a\nresulting reduction in our net income and an\nincrease to our allowance. Conversely, an\nimprovement of economic conditions or our\neconomic outlook, particularly following a\nperiod of poor economic conditions, could\nresult in a recapture of provision for credit\nlosses for a period of time with a resulting\nincrease in our net income and decrease in our\nallowance. Either set of conditions is not\nlikely to be sustained and may obscure actual\ncurrent operations and financial performance.\nThe Risk Factor headed \u201cThere are risks\nresulting from the extensive use of models,\nsome of which use artificial intelligence\n(AI), in our business\u201d further discusses risks\nassociated with estimating expected losses\nunder CECL.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nThe concentration and mix of our assets could\nincrease the potential for significant credit\nlosses.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often\nhave heightened credit exposure to a\nparticular industry, geography, asset class or\nfinancial market. As an example, loans secured\nby commercial and residential real estate\ntypically represent a significant percentage\nof our overall credit portfolio. They also\nrepresent a portion of the assets underlying\nour investment securities. While there are\nlimitations on the extent of total exposure to\nan individual consumer or business borrower,\nevents adversely affecting some of our clients\nor counterparties, based on individual factors\nor the nature or location of their business,\nor asset classes or financial markets in which\nwe are involved, could materially and\nadversely affect us. For example, any downturn\nin the condition of the U.S. housing market\ncould result in significant write-downs of\nasset values tied to residential real estate.\nDeclining economic conditions also may impact\ncommercial borrowers more than consumer\nborrowers, or vice versa. In addition, we\nexecute transactions with counterparties in\nthe financial services industries. Financial\nservices institutions are interrelated because\nof trading, funding, clearing or other\nrelationships. As a result, uncertainty about\nthe stability of other financial services\ninstitutions could lead to market-wide losses\nand defaults. Thus, the concentration and mix\nof our assets may affect the severity of the\nimpact of recessions or other economic\ndownturns on us.\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nimpacted significantly by market interest\nrates and movements in those rates.\n\nAs a result of the high percentage of our\nassets and liabilities that are in the form of\ninterest-bearing or interest-related\ninstruments, changes in interest rates, in the\nshape of the yield curve, or in spreads\nbetween different market interest rates can\nhave a material effect on our business, our\nprofitability and the value of our financial\nassets and liabilities. For example:\n\n\u2022 Changes in interest rates or interest rate\nspreads affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets such as loans\nand investment securities and the interest\nthat we pay on liabilities such as deposits\nand borrowings, which impacts our overall net\ninterest income and margin as well as our\nprofitability.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can affect the ability of\nborrowers to meet obligations under variable\nor adjustable rate loans and other debt\ninstruments and can, in turn, increase our\ncredit losses on those assets.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can decrease the demand for\ninterest rate-based products and services,\nincluding loans and deposit accounts.\n\n\u2022 Such changes affect our hedging of various\nforms of market and interest rate risk and may\ndecrease the effectiveness of those hedges in\nhelping to manage such risks.\n\n\u2022 Movements in interest rates also affect loan\nprepayment speeds and could result in\nimpairments of mortgage servicing assets or\notherwise affect the profitability of such\nassets.\n\n\u2022 Increases in interest rates likely lower the\nprice we would receive on fixed-rate customer\nobligations if we were to sell them.\n\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments\nadjust promptly in accordance with changes in\nmarket rates, while others adjust only\nperiodically or are fixed throughout a defined\nterm. As a result, the impact of changes in\ninterest rates can be either increased or\ndiluted due to differences in the relative\nvariability of the rates paid on our\nliabilities in relation to the rates received\non our assets. The extent to which we have\nelected to hedge interest rate risk through\ninterest rate swaps also affects the impact of\nrate changes. We attempt to manage the balance\nsheet to increase our benefit or reduce\nnegative impacts from future movements in\ninterest rates, but failures to anticipate\nactual movements may have the opposite result.\nIn addition, we do not generally hedge all of\nour risk and the fact that we attempt to hedge\nany risk does not mean we will be successful.\n\nWhile higher interest rates generally enhance\nour ability to grow our net interest income,\nthere are risks associated with a rising\ninterest rate environment. As a general\nmatter, increasing rates tend to decrease the\nvalue of fixed-rate financial instruments held\non our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cOur business and financial\nperformance are vulnerable to the impact of\nchanges in the values of financial assets.\u201d\nAlso, customers have and may continue to be\nless willing or able overall to borrow at\nhigher rates. Higher interest rates also have\nhindered and may continue to hinder the\nability of borrowers to support interest\npayments on variable rate loans. Higher\ninterest rates have and may continue to\nindirectly affect the value of asset classes\nsuch as real estate typically financed through\nsecured loans, with a resulting negative\neffect on collateral securing such loans. As\nanother example, there are increased\ncompetitive pressures as rates on deposit\nproducts rise. The benefits of higher interest\nrates are best achieved if we can increase the\nrates on loans and other assets faster than\nthe rates on deposits and other liabilities\nincrease. We may not be able to achieve this\nresult in a rising rate environment,\nespecially if central banks introduce rate\nincreases more quickly than anticipated. On\nthe other hand, lower interest rates tend to\nhave a negative impact on our net interest\nmargin, and, unless offset by higher earning\nassets, on our net interest income.\n\nWe discuss the impact of governmental monetary\npolicy on interest rates in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cThe policies of the Federal Reserve\nand other governmental agencies have a\nsignificant impact on interest rates and\noverall financial market performance, which\nare important to our business and financial\nperformance.\u201d\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of changes in the\nvalues of financial assets.\n\nAs a financial institution, a substantial\nmajority of our assets and liabilities are\nfinancial in nature. Examples include loans,\nsecurities, servicing rights, deposits and\nborrowings. Such assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value, often significantly, due\nto movements in\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 25\nthe financial markets or market volatility as\nwell as developments specific to the asset or\nliability in question. The underlying value of\nassets under lease or securing an obligation\ngenerally decreases due to increases in supply\nor decreases in demand for the asset or\ndeterioration in the condition of the asset.\nThis could negatively impact the ability to\ncollect fully on the secured obligation.\nCredit-based assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value due to changes in the\nperceived creditworthiness of borrowers or\nother counterparties and due to changes in\nmarket interest rates.\n\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and\nliabilities to market and recognize such\nchanges either through net income or OCI.\nThus, gains or losses on these assets and\nliabilities can have a direct impact on our\nresults of operations and financial\nperformance, unless we have effectively hedged\nour exposures. We may need to record losses in\nthe value of financial assets even where our\nexpectation of realizing the face value of the\nunderlying instrument has not changed. Our\nremaining assets and liabilities are not\nmarked to market. As a result, our balance\nsheet does not precisely represent the fair\nmarket value of our financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\nIn addition, asset management revenue is\nearned primarily based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the assets being managed and thus is\nimpacted by general changes in market\nvaluations. Thus, although we are not directly\nimpacted by changes in the value of such\nassets, decreases in the value of those assets\nwould affect related noninterest income.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nOur asset and liability valuations and the\ndetermination of the amount of loss allowances\nand impairments taken on our assets are highly\nsubjective. Our estimates could materially\nimpact our results of operations or financial\nposition.\n\nOur accounting policies are key to how we\nreport our financial condition and results of\noperations. We must exercise judgment in\nselecting and applying many of these policies\nand methods to comply with GAAP and reflect\nmanagement\u2019s judgment regarding the most\nappropriate manner to report PNC\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nManagement\u2019s selection of a particular\naccounting policy to apply, while reasonable\nand appropriate, could result in PNC reporting\ndifferent results than would have been\nreported under a different alternative. In\naddition, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, SEC and other regulatory agencies may\nissue new or amend existing accounting and\nreporting standards or change existing\ninterpretations of those standards that could\nmaterially affect our financial statements. In\nsome cases, PNC may be required to\nretrospectively apply a new or amended\nstandard resulting in changes to previously\nreported financial results.\n\nCertain accounting policies require that we\nuse estimates, assumptions and judgments in\npreparing our financial statements, including\nin determining credit loss reserves, reserves\nrelated to legal proceedings and the fair\nvalue of certain assets and liabilities, among\nother items. These policies require management\nto make difficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are inherently\nuncertain, and different amounts could be\nreported under different conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. For example, CECL\nrequires us to make difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about future economic and\nmarket conditions in determining the ACL.\n\nSome of our financial instruments, including\ncertain derivatives, debt securities, loans,\nMSRs and private equity investments, among\nother items, require a determination of their\nfair value for our financial statements.\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value\ninherently result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Changes in\nunderlying factors or assumptions in any of\nthe areas underlying our estimates could\nmaterially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations. During\nperiods of market disruption, it would be\ndifficult to value certain assets if trading\nbecomes less frequent and/or market data\nbecomes less observable. There may be certain\nasset classes that were historically traded in\nactive markets with significant observable\ndata that rapidly become illiquid due to\nmarket volatility, a loss in market confidence\nor other factors. In addition, we have assets\nand liabilities carried at fair value that are\nestimated using unobservable inputs that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities. The valuation of any asset or\nliability substantially based on unobservable\ninputs is necessarily less reliable than those\nbased on active trading markets. Further,\nrapidly changing and unprecedented market\nconditions could materially impact the\nvaluation of assets as reported within our\nconsolidated financial statements. Our ability\nto hedge exposure is in part dependent on our\nability to value the related assets or\nliabilities.\n\nThe determination of the amount of loss\nallowances and asset impairments varies by\nasset type and is based upon our periodic\nevaluation and assessment of known and\ninherent risks associated with the respective\nasset class. Management updates its\nevaluations regularly and reflects changes in\nallowances and impairments in operations as\nsuch evaluations are revised. Although we have\npolicies and procedures in place to determine\nloss allowance and asset impairments, due to\nthe subjective nature of this area, the level\nof impairments taken, and allowances reflected\nin our financial statements may not accurately\nreflect the actual level of risk and the\namount of future losses.\n\n26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models, some of which use artificial\nintelligence (AI), in our business.\n\nWe use financial and statistical models\nthroughout many areas of our business, relying\non them to inform decision making, automate\nprocesses, and estimate many financial values.\nWe increasingly use models related to how we\ndo business with customers and for internal\nprocess automation that leverage AI/machine\nlearning algorithms. These models can be more\npredictive, but because of the complex way in\nwhich the many variables in AI/machine\nlearning models interact, the results of these\nmodels are often less interpretable than\ntraditional statistical models. Examples of\nmodel uses include determining the pricing of\nvarious products, identifying potentially\nfraudulent or suspicious transactions,\nmarketing to potential customers, grading\nloans and extending credit, measuring interest\nrate and other market risks, predicting or\nestimating losses, and assessing capital\nadequacy. We depend significantly on models\nfor credit loss accounting under CECL, capital\nstress testing and estimating the value of\nitems in our financial statements.\n\nModels generally predict or infer certain\nfinancial outcomes, leveraging historical data\nand assumptions as to the future, often with\nrespect to macroeconomic conditions.\nDevelopment and implementation of some of\nthese models, such as the models for credit\nloss accounting under CECL, require us to make\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nOther models are used to support decisions\nmade regarding how we do business with\ncustomers. Poorly designed or implemented\nmodels present the risk that our business\ndecisions based on information incorporating\nmodel output will be adversely affected due to\nthe inadequacy of that information. For\nexample, our models may not be effective if\nhistorical data does not accurately represent\nfuture events or environments or if our models\nrely on erroneous data, formulas, algorithms\nor assumptions and our internal model review\nprocesses fail to detect and address these\nflaws. Models, if flawed, could cause\ninformation we provide to the public or to our\nregulators to be inaccurate or misleading.\nSome of the decisions that our regulators\nmake, including those related to capital\ndistribution to our shareholders, would likely\nbe affected adversely if they perceive that\nthe quality of the relevant models we use is\ninsufficient. Finally, flaws in our models\nthat negatively impact our customers or our\nability to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations could negatively affect our\nreputation or result in fines and penalties\nfrom our regulators.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Our Need for Customers     \n                                              \nOur success depends on our ability to attract\nand retain customers for our products and\nservices.\n\nOur performance is subject to risks associated\nwith declines in customer demand for our\nproducts and services. As a result of the\nnature of those products and services, we are\nparticularly at risk for losses of economic\nconfidence or customer trust in us or, more\nbroadly, in financial services institutions\nlike us.\n\nEconomic and market developments may affect\nconsumer and business confidence levels. If\ncustomers lose confidence due to concerns\nregarding the economy, the demand for our\nproducts and services could suffer. If we fail\nto attract and retain customers, demand for\nour loans and other financial products and\nservices could decrease, and we could\nexperience adverse changes in payment\npatterns. We could lose interest income from a\ndecline in credit usage and noninterest income\nfrom a decline in product sales, investments\nand other transactions. Demand for our\nproducts and services could also suffer as\nmany of the risks to PNC related to the\neconomy and other external factors, including\nregulation, such as changes to tax laws and\ntax rates, could negatively impact consumers\nand businesses and their interest in or\nability to use our products and services.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customer\ndeposits is impacted by the levels of interest\nrates, as customers balance the benefits of\nbank accounts with deposit insurance and some\nof the convenience associated with more\ntraditional banking products against the\npossibility of higher yields from other\ninvestments. In general, if the spread between\nthe rates we offer and those offered by\nalternatives to bank accounts widens,\ncustomers are often willing to forego the\nbenefits of bank accounts (such as FDIC\ninsurance) for higher returns elsewhere. Our\ncustomers have removed and could continue to\nremove money from checking, savings or other\ntypes of deposit accounts with us in favor of\nother banks or other types of cash management\nproducts. In such circumstances, we need to\nincrease rates to levels that are seen as\ncompetitive or lose customers, in either case\nwith a negative impact to net interest income.\nIn addition, deposits are a low-cost source of\nfunds for us. Therefore, losing deposits could\nincrease our funding costs and reduce our net\ninterest income. Loss of customers could also\nharm noninterest income by decreasing fee-\nbearing transaction volume. In addition, when\nrates are higher, customers tend to shift\ndeposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to\ninterest-bearing ones, thereby negatively\nimpacting net interest income.\n\nOur customers increasingly use third-party\nfinancial applications that are expected to\ninterface with their PNC accounts. This use\nleads to the risk that issues with respect to\nthe effective functioning of that interface,\nregardless of cause, could result in a loss of\ncustomers as they seek banking relationships\nthat work better with these other\napplications.\n\nNews or other publicity that harms our\nreputation, or harms the reputation of our\nindustry generally, also could cause a loss of\ncustomers or a reduction in the extent to\nwhich customers do business with us. This is\ndescribed further in the Risk Factor headed\n\u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\u201d\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 27\nIn our asset management business, investment\nperformance is an important factor influencing\nthe level of assets that we manage. Poor\ninvestment advice or performance could hurt\nrevenue and growth as existing clients might\nwithdraw funds in favor of better performing\nproducts. Additionally, the ability to attract\nfunds from existing and new clients might\ndiminish. Overall economic conditions may\nlimit the amount that customers are able or\nwilling to invest as well as the value of the\nassets they do invest. The failure or negative\nperformance of products of other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a loss of\nconfidence in similar products offered by us\nwithout regard to the performance of our\nproducts. Such a negative contagion could lead\nto withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity\nissues in such products and have an adverse\nimpact on our assets under management and\nasset management revenues and earnings.\n\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\n\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract\nand retain customers and employees, and to\ngrow our business is dependent on maintaining\nour reputation and having the trust of our\ncustomers, employees, the communities that we\nserve and other stakeholders. Many types of\ndevelopments, if publicized, can negatively\nimpact a company\u2019s reputation with adverse\nconsequences to its business.\n\nFinancial services companies are highly\nvulnerable to reputational damage when they\nare found to have harmed customers,\nparticularly retail customers, through conduct\nthat is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive,\nabusive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful.\nThere also may be reputational damage from\nhuman error or systems failures viewed as\nhaving harmed customers without involving\nmisconduct, including service disruptions or\nnegative perceptions regarding our ability to\nmaintain the security of our technology\nsystems and protect client data. For example,\nwe may suffer reputational harm to the extent\nthat we are unable to successfully detect,\nprevent and remedy fraud that harms our\nclients. Our reputation may also be harmed by\nfailing to deliver products and services of\nthe quality expected by our customers and\nsupport the communities that we serve. In\naddition, our reputation may be harmed as a\nresult of our participation in certain\nprograms, such as those supporting diversity\nand inclusion, that may expose us to increased\nscrutiny and criticism. Significant\nacquisitions by large banks also often attract\npublic scrutiny, which may result in negative\npublicity that adversely affects our\nreputation if we engage in such a transaction.\nWe are also subject to the risk of\nreputational harm resulting from conduct of\npersons identified as our employees but acting\noutside of the scope of their employment,\nincluding through their misconduct, unethical\nbehavior, or activities on personal social\nmedia. The reputational impact is likely\ngreater to the extent that the bad conduct,\nerrors or failures are pervasive, long-\nstanding or affect a significant number of\ncustomers, particularly retail consumers. The\nnegative impact of such reputational damage on\nour business may be disproportionate to the\nactual harm caused to customers. It may be\nsevere even if we fully remediate any harm\nsuffered by our customers. Furthermore,\nbecause we conduct most of our businesses\nunder the \u201cPNC\u201d brand, negative public opinion\nabout one business could also affect our other\nbusinesses. In addition, we could suffer\nreputational harm and a loss of customer trust\nas a result of the conduct of others in our\nindustry even if we have not engaged in such\nconduct. We use third parties to help in many\naspects of our business, with the risk that\ntheir conduct can affect our reputation\nregardless of the degree to which we are\nresponsible for it.\n\nTo an increasing extent, financial services\ncompanies, including PNC, are facing criticism\nwith accompanying reputational risk from\nactivists, investors and stakeholders who\nbelieve companies should be focusing more or\nless on environmental, social and governance\nmatters. Companies in our industry, including\nPNC, are targeted for engaging in business\nwith specific customers or with customers in\nparticular industries, where the customers\u2019\nactivities, even if legal, are perceived as\nhaving harmful impacts on matters such as the\nenvironment, consumer health and safety, or\nsociety at large. In addition, some activists,\ninvestors and other stakeholders are seeking\nincreased transparency and action from\nfinancial services companies with respect to\nenvironmental, social and governance\nactivities, political activities and\nactivities that are or may be perceived to be\npolitically partisan in nature. Criticism has\ncome in many forms, including protests at PNC\nfacilities and social media campaigns. In some\ncircumstances, our stakeholders have held and\ncontinue to hold conflicting views on the role\nPNC and other financial services companies\nshould play in continuing to or refraining\nfrom financing certain sectors. In some cases,\nwe are subject to potentially conflicting\nproposed and enacted state and local laws\naffecting our industry that regulate the\nmanner in which or whether we may finance or\nservice certain clients, industries or\nsectors. Many of these issues are divisive\nwithout broad agreement as to the appropriate\nsteps a company such as PNC should take. As a\nresult, however we respond to such criticism,\nwe expose ourselves to the risks that current\nor potential customers decline to do business\nwith us or current or potential employees\nrefuse to work for us. This can be true\nregardless of whether we are perceived by some\nas not having done enough to address these\nconcerns or by others as having\ninappropriately yielded to these pressures.\nThese pressures can also be a factor in\ndecisions as to which business opportunities\nand customers we pursue, potentially resulting\nin foregone profit opportunities.\n\nThe speed with which information moves through\nsocial media and other news sources on the\ninternet means that negative information about\nPNC can rapidly have a broadly adverse impact\non our reputation. This is true whether or not\nthe information is accurate. False information\ncan also be spread from unaffiliated or parody\nsocial media accounts pretending to be\nofficial company communications channels. Once\ninformation has gone viral, it can be\ndifficult to counter it effectively, either by\ncorrecting inaccuracies or communicating\nremedial steps taken for actual issues. The\npotential impact of negative information going\nviral means that material reputational harm\ncan result from a single discrete or isolated\nincident.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nin terms of the products and services we offer\nand the geographic markets in which we conduct\nbusiness.\n\nWe are subject to intense competition both\nfrom other financial institutions and from\nnon-bank entities, including financial\ntechnology companies (often referred to as\n\u201cFinTech\u201d). In many cases, non-bank entities\ncan engage in many activities similar to ours\nor offer products and services desirable to\nour customers without being subject to the\nsame types of regulation, supervision and\nrestrictions that are applicable to banks,\nwhich could place us at a competitive\ndisadvantage. Emerging financial technologies,\nincluding with respect to payment services and\nsystems, lending, digital wallets, non-\nfungible tokens and digital currencies and\ncryptocurrencies, may affect our customers\u2019\nneeds and expectations for products and\nservices. We may fail to attract or retain\ncustomers if we are unable to develop and\nmarket products and services that meet\nevolving customer needs or demands or if we\nare unable to deliver them effectively and\nsecurely to our customers. We may also fail to\nattract or retain customers if we are\nunwilling to provide products or services that\nwe deem to be speculative or risky. The\ncompetition we face is described in Item 1 of\nthis Report under \u201cCompetition.\u201d\n\nConsolidation in our industry, including among\nsmaller banks combining to form more\ncompetitive larger ones and between banks and\nnon-bank entities, could result in PNC facing\nmore intense competition, particularly in\nimpacted regions or with respect to particular\nproducts. As we expand into new markets, we\nmay face competitors with more experience and\nestablished relationships in these markets,\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to\ncompete.\n\nA failure to adequately address the\ncompetitive pressures we face could make it\nharder for us to attract and retain customers\nacross our businesses. On the other hand,\nmeeting these competitive pressures could\nrequire us to incur significant additional\nexpense or to accept risk beyond what we would\notherwise view as desirable under the\ncircumstances. In addition, in our interest\nrate sensitive businesses, competitive\npressures to increase rates on deposits or\ndecrease rates on loans could reduce our net\ninterest margin, negatively impacting our net\ninterest income.\n\nWe depend on skilled labor, and employee\nattrition, competition for talented employees\nand labor shortages may have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operations.\n\nOur performance is dependent on attracting and\nretaining talented and diverse employees. We\nface significant competition for these\nemployees across many of our businesses and\nsupport areas. This presents greater risk as\nwe expand into new markets, develop new\nproduct lines, or enhance staffing in certain\nareas, particularly technology. This\ncompetition leads to increased expenses in\naffected business areas. Differences in\ndemands, expectations and priorities of the\nworkforce (such as remote work expectations)\nmay require us to modify our recruiting and\nretention strategies to attract and retain\nemployees. Limitations on the way regulated\nfinancial institutions can compensate their\nofficers and employees, including those\ncontained in pending rule proposals\nimplementing requirements of Dodd-Frank, may\nmake it more difficult for regulated financial\ninstitutions, including PNC, to compete with\nother companies for talent.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Other Operational Issues   \n                                              \nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity\nof employees, and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible, to manage\noperational risks.\n\nWe are a large company that offers a wide\nvariety of products and services to a broad\nand diverse group of customers. We rely on our\nemployees to design, manage and operate our\nsystems and controls to assure that we\nproperly enter into, record and manage\nprocesses, transactions and other\nrelationships with customers, suppliers and\nother parties with whom we do business. In\nsome cases, we rely on employees of third\nparties to perform these tasks. We also depend\non employees and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible to assure that we\nidentify and mitigate the risks that are\ninherent in our relationships and activities.\nThese concerns are increased when we change\nprocesses or procedures, introduce new\nproducts or services, acquire or invest in a\nbusiness or implement new technologies, as we\nmay fail to adequately identify or manage\noperational risks resulting from such changes.\nThese concerns may be further exacerbated by\nemployee turnover and labor shortages.\n\nAs a large financial services firm, we are\nfaced with ongoing attempts by individuals or\norganizations to defraud us or our customers\nfor financial gain. We depend on systems,\nprocesses and personnel, either at PNC or from\nthird parties, to identify and prevent\npotentially fraudulent transactions, but those\nsystems may not be adequate and fraudulent\nactors regularly change tactics to improve\ntheir chance of success. Even if PNC is not\nfinancially responsible for reimbursing a\ncustomer for its fraud losses, such losses may\ndamage PNC\u2019s reputation or ability to attract\nand retain customers.\n\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on\nemployees, whether ours or those of third\nparties, to perform these tasks and manage\nresulting risks, we are thus subject to human\nvulnerabilities. These range from innocent\nhuman error to misconduct or malfeasance,\npotentially leading to operational breakdowns\nor other failures. Our controls may not be\nadequate to prevent problems resulting from\nhuman\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 29\ninvolvement in our business, including risks\nassociated with the design, operation and\nmonitoring of automated systems. We may also\nfail to adequately maintain a culture of risk\nmanagement among our employees.\n\nErrors by our employees or others responsible\nfor systems and controls on which we depend\nand any resulting failures of those systems\nand controls to prevent unethical, fraudulent,\nimproper or illegal conduct could result in\nsignificant harm to PNC. This harm could\ninclude customer remediation costs, regulatory\nfines or penalties, litigation or enforcement\nactions or limitations on our business\nactivities. We could also suffer damage to our\nreputation, as described under \u201cWe are at risk\nfor an adverse impact on our business due to\ndamage to our reputation.\u201d\n\nWe use automation, machine learning,\nartificial intelligence and robotic process\nautomation tools to help reduce some risks of\nhuman error. Nonetheless, we continue to rely\non many manual processes to conduct our\nbusiness and manage our risks. In addition,\nuse of automation tools does not eliminate the\nneed for effective design and monitoring of\ntheir operation to make sure they operate as\nintended. Enhanced use of automation may\npresent its own risks. Automated systems may\nthemselves experience outages or problems.\nSome tools are dependent on the quality of the\ndata used by the tool to learn and enhance the\nprocess for which it is responsible. Bad,\nmissing or anomalous data can adversely affect\nthe functioning of such tools. It is possible\nthat humans in some cases are better able than\nhighly automated tools to identify that\nanomalous data is being used or that results\nare themselves anomalous.\n\nWe rely on third-party vendors, service\nproviders and other counterparties to help\nsupport many aspects of our business. When we\ndo so, our direct control of activities\nrelated to our business is reduced, which\nintroduces risk.\n\nOur use of third parties to support our\nbusiness needs typically means that we do not\ndirectly control the activities we are having\nthem perform. Any disruption in services\nprovided by these third parties could\nadversely affect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. Replacing third parties could also\nentail significant delay and expense. Risks\ncan arise through inadequate performance by a\nthird party (including by its downstream\nservice providers), specifically where that\nperformance could affect us or our customers,\nand even when the result of factors or events\nare beyond such third party\u2019s control. Many of\nthe kinds of risks presented by activities\nperformed by third parties are described\nelsewhere in these Risk Factors. Enhanced\nregulatory and other standards for the\noversight of our use of third-party vendors\nand other service providers can result in\nhigher costs and other potential exposures. We\nare also vulnerable, including to regulatory\npenalties, if an outside company fails to\ncomply with legal requirements relevant to its\nwork on our behalf. We may in any such\ncircumstance suffer financial losses, legal\nconsequences and injury to our reputation.\nEven if the other company makes us whole for\nfinancial losses, which is not necessarily the\ncase, it is unlikely that it would be able to\nrestore any injury to our reputation. As a\nresult, the use of third parties to assist in\nour business activities heightens the risks to\nus inherent in those activities.\n                                              \n  Other Key Risks                             \n                                              \nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse\nresults in legal proceedings.\n\nMany aspects of our business involve\nsubstantial risk of legal liability. We have\nbeen named or threatened to be named as\ndefendants in various lawsuits arising from\nour business activities. In addition, we are\nregularly the subject of governmental\ninvestigations and other forms of regulatory\ninquiry. We also are at risk when we have\nagreed to indemnify others for losses related\nto legal proceedings they face, such as in\nconnection with the sale of a business or\nassets by us. The results of these legal\nproceedings could lead to significant monetary\ndamages or penalties, restrictions on the way\nin which we conduct our business or\nreputational harm.\n\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal\nproceedings when information related to the\nloss contingencies represented by those\nmatters indicates both that a loss is probable\nand that the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we do not have accruals for all\nlegal proceedings where we face a risk of\nloss. In addition, due to the inherent\nsubjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of the outcome of legal\nproceedings, amounts accrued often do not\nrepresent the ultimate loss to us from the\nlegal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nultimate future losses may be higher, and\npossibly significantly so, than the amounts\naccrued for legal loss contingencies. We\ndiscuss further the unpredictability of legal\nproceedings and describe certain of our\npending legal proceedings in Note 20 Legal\nProceedings.\n\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring\nother financial services businesses from time\nto time. Sometimes these are businesses with\ntechnologies or other assets valuable to us\neven if they do not themselves provide\nfinancial services to customers. Acquisitions\npresent a number of risks and uncertainties\nrelated both to the acquisition transactions\nthemselves and to the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing.\n\nAcquisitions of other companies or of\nfinancial assets and deposits and other\nliabilities present risks and uncertainties to\nus in addition to those presented by the\nnature of the business acquired, which may\nmaterially and adversely affect our results of\noperations. Many of the same risks arise when\nwe engage in strategic partnerships. Our\nability to analyze the risks presented by\nprospective acquisitions, as well as our\nability to prepare in advance of closing for\nintegration, may be limited to the extent that\nwe cannot gather necessary or desirable\ninformation with respect to the business we\nare acquiring. We may also make certain\nassumptions related to an acquisition that may\nprove to be inaccurate that limit the\nanticipated benefits (such as cost savings\nfrom synergies or strategic gains from being\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nable to offer enhanced product sets) or make\nthe acquisition more expensive or take longer\nto complete and integrate than anticipated.\nPrior to closing an acquisition, prospective\nacquisition targets are also subject to their\nown risks that we cannot manage or control.\nOur ability to complete an acquisition may be\ndependent on regulatory agencies with\nresponsibilities for reviewing or approving\nthe transaction, which could delay,\nrestrictively condition or result in denial of\nan acquisition, or otherwise limit the\nbenefits of the acquisition. Changes in\nregulatory rules or standards or the\napplication of those rules or standards, or\nfuture regulatory initiatives designed to\npromote competition or limit systemic risk and\nthe potential for a financial institution to\nbecome \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d may also limit our\nability to complete an acquisition.\n\nAcquisition targets have their own risks\nspecific to their businesses that could impact\nthe success of an acquisition and its\nintegration into PNC, such as:\n\n\u2022 If a significant aspect of the value of\ntransaction is intellectual property, the\nextent to which the intellectual property may\nbe utilized or protected and commercialized by\nPNC.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition includes loan portfolios,\nthe extent of actual credit losses and the\nrequired allowance for credit losses following\ncompletion of the acquisition.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition involves entering into\nnew businesses or geographic or other markets,\npotential limitations on our ability to take\nadvantage of these opportunities because of\nour inexperience with respect to them.\n\n\u2022 The results of litigation and governmental\ninvestigations that may be pending at the time\nof the acquisition or that may be filed or\ncommenced thereafter, because of an\nacquisition or otherwise, which are often hard\nto predict.\n\n\u2022 Operational or compliance issues at the\nacquisition target may not be fully identified\nor remediated until after the acquisition\ncloses, potentially resulting in increased\ncosts or penalties.\n\n\u2022 Models used by an acquisition target, such\nas for capital planning and credit loss\naccounting, may be designed or implemented in\na manner different than at PNC, and our\nnecessary reliance on these for a period of\ntime, could materially impact our financial\ncondition or results of operations to the\nextent that our estimates based on these\nmodels are inaccurate.\n\n\u2022 Enterprise risk management systems, policies\nand procedures may be different and less\nmature than those of PNC, and our necessary\nreliance on these for a period of time, could\nlimit PNC\u2019s ability to identify, monitor,\nmanage and report risks or subject us to\nheightened regulatory, legal, operational or\nreputational risk.\n\nAfter closing, the success of an acquisition\nis likely partially dependent on our ability\nto retain and expand upon the acquired\ncompany\u2019s customer base. It is also frequently\nsubject to risks related to human capital,\nincluding, risks related to integrating the\ncorporate culture of the acquired company and,\nto the extent being retained, the quality of\nleadership of the acquired company.\n\nOur business and financial performance could\nbe adversely affected, directly or indirectly,\nby disasters, natural or otherwise, by\nterrorist activities, by international\nhostilities or by domestic civil unrest.\n\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential\nimpact of natural and other disasters\n(including severe weather events), health\nemergencies, dislocations, geopolitical\ninstabilities, terrorist activities,\ninternational hostilities or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control can\nbe predicted. However, these occurrences could\nadversely impact us, for example, by causing\nsignificant damage to our facilities or\npreventing us from conducting our business in\nthe ordinary course. Also, their impact on our\nborrowers, depositors, other customers,\nsuppliers or other counterparties could result\nin indirect adverse effects on us. Other\nindirect adverse consequences from these\noccurrences could result from impacts to the\nfinancial markets, the economy in general or\nin any region, or key parts of the\ninfrastructure (such as the power grid) on\nwhich we and our customers rely. These types\nof indirect effects, whether specific to our\ncounterparties or more generally applicable,\ncould lead, for example, to an increase in\ndelinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that\ncould result in PNC experiencing higher levels\nof nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and\nprovisions for credit losses. They could also\ncause a reduction in demand for lending or\nother services that we provide.\n\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse\nconsequences of such occurrences is in part\ndependent on the quality of our resiliency\nplanning. This includes our ability to\nanticipate the nature of any such event that\nmight occur. The adverse impact of these\noccurrences also could be increased to the\nextent that there is a lack of preparedness on\nthe part of national or regional emergency\nresponders or on the part of other\norganizations and businesses that we deal\nwith, many of which we depend on but have\nlimited or no control over.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 1B \u2013 UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS       \u2502\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\nThere are no SEC staff comments regarding\nPNC\u2019s periodic or current reports under the\nExchange Act that are pending resolution.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 1C \u2013 CYBERSECURITY                   \u2502\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\nWe manage our cybersecurity risk as an\nintegral part of our enterprise risk\nmanagement programs. Accordingly, you should\nreview the disclosure in this Item 1C in\nconjunction with the disclosure in the Risk\nManagement section of this Report.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 31\n                                              \n  Information Security Program                \n                                              \nPNC\u2019s approach to cyber risk management,\noversight, and reporting is based on a well-\nstructured information security program. The\nprogram is responsible for protecting\ninformation assets to achieve business\nobjectives in a secure manner and designed to\nkeep customers\u2019 information and their funds\nsafe and available. Program capabilities are\nbuilt against industry guidance and a security\nframework to identify risks to sensitive\ninformation, protect that information and\nmaintain an appropriate response and recovery\ncapability to help ensure resilience against\ninformation security incidents.\n\nPNC\u2019s information security program is designed\nto ensure that PNC follows industry guidance\nand security frameworks for data protection,\nsystem development security, identity and\naccess management, incident management, threat\nand vulnerability management, security\noperations management and third- and fourth-\nparty security. Our program is continuously\nenhanced by threat intelligence, new\nregulations, industry guidance and disruptive\nnew technologies. The program includes, among\nother things, annual security and privacy\ntraining for all PNC employees, phishing\nexercises, and informative articles and\ncommunications to raise employee awareness.\n\nPNC actively monitors and responds to the\noverall cybersecurity threat landscape via\nactive capabilities to share information and\nleverage intelligence, monitoring, and\nresponse capabilities across the security\nindustry, which include cybersecurity threats,\nphysical threats and fraud. PNC\u2019s intelligence\nand analysis capabilities collaborate to\nanalyze events and trends for possible\nresponse.\n\nWe have not experienced any material\ncybersecurity threats that have impacted PNC\u2019s\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition to date. Notwithstanding\nour well-established approach regarding\ncybersecurity, we may not be successful in\npreventing or mitigating the impact of a\ncybersecurity incident that could have a\nmaterial impact on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition. See Item 1A\nRisk Factors of this Report for a discussion\nof cybersecurity risks.\n                                              \n  Board Governance and Risk Oversight         \n                                              \nPNC\u2019s Board of Directors maintains governance\nand oversight of the risks posed by\ncybersecurity threats through the Board-level\nTechnology and Risk Committees.\n\nThe Technology Committee meets no less than\nquarterly, and its purpose is to (i) assist\nthe Board with the oversight of technology\nstrategy and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs, including those that\ncan position the use of technology to drive\nstrategic advantages and (ii) fulfill\noversight responsibilities with respect to\ntechnology risk, information management, and\nsecurity risks (including cyber security,\ncyber fraud, and physical security risks), and\nthe adequacy of PNC\u2019s business recovery,\nresiliency and contingency plans and test\nresults.\n\nThe Technology Committee is informed of cyber\nthreats and risks through multiple mechanisms.\nPNC\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer\npresents quarterly to the Technology Committee\non such topics as threat intelligence and\nassessment reports, incident and event\nreporting from other institutions, governance\nand regulatory exam statuses, and the status\nof other key program deliverables, among other\ncontent.\n\nThe Risk Committee meets no less than\nquarterly and provides oversight of PNC\u2019s ERM\nframework. Cybersecurity risk is integrated\ninto PNC\u2019s overall ERM framework, and is\nrepresented as the Information Security\ndomain, alongside seven other operational risk\ndomains. See the Risk Management section of\nthis Report for more details on our ERM\nframework.\n\nPNC\u2019s inherent information security risks, the\nmaturity and completeness of the control\nenvironment, and measurements against our risk\nappetite are presented quarterly to the\nTechnology Committee by the firm\u2019s Chief\nTechnology Risk Officer. Overall risks across\nthe Enterprise Risk Framework are then\nreported quarterly to the Risk Committee by\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nCommunication to the Board occurs more\nfrequently than quarterly, when dictated by\nincident and event management policies and\nprocedures based on the criticality and\nurgency of the communication.\n                                              \n  Role of Management                          \n                                              \nManagement is directly involved in assessing\nand managing PNC\u2019s risks from cybersecurity\nthreats. PNC uses a three-lines-of-defense\nmodel where cybersecurity risk is managed and\nassessed by the first line of defense, led by\nthe Chief Information Security Officer and the\nDirector of Technology and Security Risk\nManagement, and the second line of defense\nwhich is led by the Chief Technology Risk\nOfficer, who reports to the Chief Risk\nOfficer. The first and second lines of defense\nare examined internally by our third line of\ndefense, Internal Audit. The lines of defense\nmodel ensures appropriate oversight within the\nmanagement structure. See the Risk Governance\nand Oversight section of Risk Management for\nmore details on each of our lines of defense.\nIn addition to the three lines of internal\ndefense, PNC engages external consultants to\nassess and inform the program, as needed.\n\nThe Chief Information Security Officer\u2019s\norganization includes managers who have led\ncybersecurity programs in other industries\nsuch as robotics and artificial intelligence,\nconsulting, telecommunications, healthcare,\nand manufacturing, which brings together a\nmulti-faceted approach to managing\ncybersecurity threats and risks. The\nInformation Security department leadership and\npersonnel hold degrees in Information\nSecurity, Management Information Systems,\nComputer Science, Engineering Management and\nother professional majors.

Our Board of Directors may\nnot pay or set apart dividends on the common\nstock until dividends for all past dividend\nperiods on any series of outstanding preferred\nstock and certain outstanding capital\nsecurities issued by the parent company have\nbeen paid or declared and set apart for\npayment. The Board of Directors presently\nintends to continue the policy of paying\nquarterly cash dividends. The amount of any\nfuture dividends will depend on economic and\nmarket conditions, our financial condition and\noperating results, and other factors,\nincluding contractual restrictions and\napplicable government regulations and policies\n(such as those relating to the ability of bank\nand non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to\nthe parent company and regulatory capital\nlimitations). PNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase\ndividends or otherwise return capital to\nshareholders is subject to PNC\u2019s compliance\nwith its SCB, which is determined at least\nannually through the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR\nprocess as described in the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report.\nConsistent with the SCB framework, which\nallows for capital return in amounts in excess\nof the SCB minimum levels, our Board of\nDirectors has authorized a repurchase\nframework under the previously approved\nrepurchase program of up to 100 million common\nshares, of which approximately 45% were still\navailable for repurchase at December 31, 2023.\nIn light of the Federal banking agencies\nproposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, share repurchase activity is\nexpected to remain modest during the first\nquarter of 2024. PNC continues to evaluate the\npotential impact of the proposed rules and may\nadjust share repurchase activity depending on\nmarket and economic conditions, as well as\nother factors. PNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter\nperiod beginning October 1, 2023 is the\nregulatory minimum of 2.5%.\n\nFor further information concerning dividend\nrestrictions and other factors that could\nlimit our ability to pay dividends, as well as\nrestrictions on loans, dividends or advances\nfrom bank subsidiaries to the parent company,\nsee the Supervision and Regulation section in\nItem 1, Item 1A Risk Factors and the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section in Item 7, and Note 9\nBorrowed Funds, Note 11 Equity and Note 19\nRegulatory Matters, which we include here by\nreference.\n\nWe include here by reference the information\nregarding our compensation plans under which\nPNC equity securities are authorized for\nissuance as of December 31, 2023 in the table\n(with introductory paragraph and notes) in\nItem 12 of this Report.\n\nOur stock transfer agent and registrar is:\n\nComputershare\n\n150 Royall Street, Suite 101\n\nCanton, MA 02021\n\n800-982-7652\n\nHearing impaired: 800-952-9245\n\nwww.computershare.com/pnc\n\nRegistered shareholders may contact\nComputershare regarding dividends and other\nshareholder services.\n\nWe include here by reference the information\nthat appears under the Common Stock\nPerformance Graph caption at the end of this\nItem 5.\n                                              \n  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities     \n                                              \nNone.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 35\n                                              \n  Equity Security Repurchases                 \n                                              \nDetails of our repurchases of PNC common stock\nduring the fourth quarter of 2023 are included\nin the following table.\n                                              \n                                          M\u2026  \n                                          n\u2026  \n                                          of  \n                                T\u2026        s\u2026  \n                                s\u2026        t\u2026  \n  \u2026                             p\u2026        m\u2026  \n  \u2026                             as        y\u2026  \n  \u2026                             p\u2026        be  \n  \u2026                   A\u2026        of        p\u2026  \n  \u2026        T\u2026         p\u2026        p\u2026        u\u2026  \n  \u2026        s\u2026         p\u2026        a\u2026        t\u2026  \n  \u2026        p\u2026         p\u2026        p\u2026        p\u2026  \n  \u2026        (\u2026         s\u2026        (\u2026        (\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    10      $  1\u2026                  4\u2026      \n  \u2013                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    78      $  1\u2026        78        4\u2026      \n  \u2013                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  1    4\u2026      $  1\u2026        4\u2026        4\u2026      \n  \u2013                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    5\u2026      $  1\u2026        5\u2026                \n                                              \n(a) Includes PNC common stock purchased in\nconnection with our various employee benefit\nplans generally related to forfeitures of\nunvested restricted stock awards and shares\nused to cover employee payroll tax withholding\nrequirements.

common share,\nfor 2022. The decrease was driven by higher\nexpenses, which included the impact of the\nFDIC special assessment and workforce\nreduction charges, as well as lower\nnoninterest income and a higher provision for\ncredit losses, partially offset by higher net\ninterest income.\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 2%,\nto $21.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income increased $0.9 billion,\nor 7%, to $13.9 billion, primarily due to\nhigher interest-earning asset yields and\nbalances, partially offset by higher funding\ncosts.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased to 2.76% for\n2023 compared to 2.65% for 2022, reflecting\nhigher yields on interest-earning assets,\npartially offset by increased funding costs.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $0.5 billion,\nor 7%, to $7.6 billion, primarily due to lower\ncapital markets and advisory income and a\ndecline in private equity revenue. The\ndecrease also included negative Visa Class B\nderivative fair value adjustments of $279\nmillion for 2023 compared to $40 million of\nnegative adjustments for 2022.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses was $742 million\nin 2023, primarily driven by portfolio\nactivity, including changes in credit quality\nrelated to the commercial real estate\nportfolio.

In comparison\nto December 31, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased modestly due to\nhigher balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank, partially offset by lower securities and\nloan balances.\n\n\u2022 Total loans decreased $4.5 billion, to\n$321.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans decreased $5.5\nbillion, or 2%, to $219.6 billion, driven by\nlower utilization of loan commitments and\npaydowns outpacing new production, partially\noffset by the acquisition of capital\ncommitment facilities from Signature Bridge\nBank, N.A. on October 2, 2023.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans increased $1.0 billion,\nto $102.0 billion, due to growth in\nresidential mortgages, home equity, credit\ncard and automobile loans, partially offset by\ndeclines in the remaining portfolios as\npaydowns outpaced new originations and draws\non existing accounts.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities decreased $6.8\nbillion, or 5%, to $132.6 billion, as limited\npurchase activity was more than offset by\nportfolio paydowns and maturities.\n\n\u2022 Interest earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the Federal Reserve Bank,\nincreased $16.5 billion, or 60%, to $43.8\nbillion, primarily due to higher borrowed\nfunds and lower securities and loan balances,\npartially offset by lower deposits.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits decreased $14.9 billion, or\n3%, to $421.4 billion, as a result of lower\nconsumer and commercial deposits, reflecting\nthe impact of competitive pricing dynamics and\ninflationary pressures.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds of $72.7 billion increased\n$14.0 billion, or 24%, due to parent company\nsenior debt issuances and higher FHLB\nborrowings.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Item 7.\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \n2023 reflected strong credit quality\nperformance.\n\n\u2022 At December 31, 2023 compared to December\n31, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.4 billion\ndecreased $106 million, or 7%, driven by lower\ncommercial and consumer delinquencies.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, totaled $5.5\nbillion, or 1.70% of total loans at December\n31, 2023, and was relatively stable in\ncomparison to reserves at December 31, 2022.\nThe slight increase in reserves was primarily\ndriven by portfolio activity, including\nchanges in credit quality related to the\ncommercial real estate portfolio, partially\noffset by an updated economic outlook.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets of $2.2 billion\nincreased $197 million, or 10%, due to higher\ncommercial nonperforming loans, partially\noffset by lower consumer nonperforming loans.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs of $710 million or 0.22% of\naverage loans in 2023 increased $147 million\ncompared to net charge-offs of $563 million or\n0.18% of average loans for 2022, reflecting\nhigher commercial and consumer net loan\ncharge-offs.\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nFor additional detail, see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Item 7.\n                                              \n  Capital and Liquidity Highlights            \n                                              \nWe maintained strong capital and liquidity\npositions during 2023.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity increased $4.9\nbillion to $44.9 billion at December 31, 2023,\ndue to the benefit of net income and an\nimprovement in AOCI, partially offset by\ncommon dividends paid and common share\nrepurchases.\n\n\u2022 In 2023, we returned $3.1 billion of capital\nto shareholders through dividends on common\nshares of $2.5 billion and repurchases of 4.0\nmillion common shares for $0.6 billion.\n\n\u2022 Consistent with the SCB framework, which\nallows for capital return in amounts in excess\nof the SCB minimum levels, our Board of\nDirectors has authorized a repurchase\nframework under the previously approved\nrepurchase program of up to 100 million common\nshares, of which approximately 45% were still\navailable for repurchase at December 31, 2023.\nIn light of the Federal banking agencies\nproposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, share repurchase activity is\nexpected to remain modest during the first\nquarter of 2024. PNC continues to evaluate the\npotential impact of the proposed rules and may\nadjust share repurchase activity depending on\nmarket and economic conditions, as well as\nother factors. PNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter\nperiod beginning October 1, 2023 is the\nregulatory minimum of 2.5%.\n\n\u2022 On January 4, 2024, the PNC Board of\nDirectors declared a quarterly cash dividend\non common stock of $1.55 per share paid on\nFebruary 5, 2024.\n\n\u2022 The Basel III CET1 capital ratio increased\nto 9.9% at December 31, 2023 from 9.1% at\nDecember 31, 2022.\n\n\u2022 PNC elected a five-year transition provision\neffective March 31, 2020 to delay until\nDecember 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL\nstandard on regulatory capital, followed by a\nthree-year transition period. Effective for\nthe first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the\nthree-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. The estimated fully implemented ratios\nreflect the full impact of CECL and exclude\nthe benefits of this transition provision. The\nestimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was\n9.8% at December 31, 2023 compared to 8.9% at\nDecember 31, 2022.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB\nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board in\nconnection with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nCCAR process.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject, among other things, to the risk\nthat economic and financial market conditions\nwill be substantially different than those we\nare currently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s baseline forecast is for slower\neconomic growth in 2024 as consumer spending\ngrowth slows and higher interest rates remain\na drag on the economy. The ongoing strength of\nthe labor market will continue to support\nconsumer spending. Slowing inflation will\nallow for federal funds rate cuts starting in\nthe late spring or early summer; this will\nsupport economic growth in the second half of\n2024.\n\n\u2022 GDP growth this year will be below trend at\nslightly above 1%, and the unemployment rate\nwill increase modestly to somewhat above 4% by\nthe end of 2024. Inflation will continue to\nslow as wage pressures abate, moving back to\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective\nby the end of the year.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain\nunchanged in the first part of 2024, between\n5.25% and 5.50%, with federal funds rate cuts\nstarting in May 2024 as inflation slows\nfurther. PNC expects the federal funds rate to\nend 2024 between 4.25% and 4.50%.\n\nSee Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation section in this Item 7 for other\nfactors that could cause future events to\ndiffer, perhaps materially, from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nFor the full year 2024, compared to full year\n2023, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Spot loans to be up 3% to 4%,\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up approximately 1%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down 4% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income, excluding net securities\ngains and Visa activity, to be up 4% to 6%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be stable to down 2%,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 41\n\u2022 Core noninterest expense to be stable, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n18.5%.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2023, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be down approximately 1%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down 3% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be down 6% to 8%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, excluding net\nsecurities gains and Visa activity, to be\nbetween $150 million and $200 million,\n\n\u2022 Total revenue to be down 3% to 4%,\n\n\u2022 Core noninterest expense to be down 3% to\n4%, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $200\nmillion and $250 million.\n\nCore noninterest expense guidance excludes the\n$515 million pre-tax impact of the FDIC\u2019s\nspecial assessment related to the closures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank as well\nas $150 million of pre-tax workforce reduction\ncharges incurred in the fourth quarter of\n2023.

See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest\nAnalysis and Analysis Of Year-To-Year Changes\nIn Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this\nReport for additional information.\n\nNet interest income increased $0.9 billion, or\n7% in 2023 compared with 2022. The increase\nwas due to higher interest-earning asset\nyields and balances, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs. Net interest margin\nincreased 11 basis points, reflecting higher\nyields on interest-earning assets, partially\noffset by increased funding costs.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $3.2\nbillion, or 2%, primarily reflecting an\nincrease in agency residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Average investment securities\nrepresented 28% of average interest-earning\nassets in both 2023 and 2022.\n\nAverage loans increased $15.8 billion, or 5%,\nreflecting growth in both commercial and\nconsumer loans. Average loans represented 64%\nof average interest-earning assets in 2023\ncompared to 62% in 2022.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\ndecreased $4.4 billion, or 11%, primarily due\nto lower deposits and higher loan balances,\npartially offset by higher borrowed funds.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased\n$16.4 billion, or 5%, reflecting a continued\nshift from noninterest-bearing to interest-\nbearing deposits as deposit rates have risen.\nIn total, average interest-bearing deposits\nrepresented 82% of average interest-bearing\nliabilities in 2023 compared to 88% in 2022.\n\nAverage borrowed funds increased $24.8\nbillion, or 58%, primarily due to higher FHLB\nborrowings and parent company senior debt\nissuances.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Item 7.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           2\u2026         2\u2026     \u2026       %     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026      $  1\u2026      $  \u2026      -2  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       9\u2026         1\u2026         \u2026      -\u2026  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2\u2026         2\u2026         \u2026       4  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026         1\u2026         \u2026       9  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6\u2026         6\u2026         \u2026      -3  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6\u2026         9\u2026         \u2026      -\u2026  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  7\u2026      $  8\u2026      $  \u2026      -7  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 35% for 2023 and 38% for 2022.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees decreased\nreflecting lower client activity.

In comparison\nto December 31, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased modestly due to\nhigher balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank, partially offset by lower securities and\nloan balances.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities were largely stable and\nincluded lower deposits, mostly offset by\nhigher borrowed funds.\n\n\u2022 Total equity increased due to the benefit of\nnet income, an improvement in AOCI and net\npreferred stock issuances, partially offset by\ndividends paid and common share repurchases.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.5 billion\nat December 31, 2023, and was relatively\nstable in comparison to reserves at December\n31, 2022.

Compared to\nDecember 31, 2022, our funding source\ncomposition has shifted and now includes lower\ndeposit balances and higher borrowed funds,\ncontributing to higher funding costs.\n\nTotal deposits decreased as a result of lower\nconsumer and commercial deposits, reflecting\nthe impact of competitive pricing dynamics and\ninflationary pressures. In addition,\nnoninterest-bearing balances decreased due to\nthe continued shift into interest-bearing\ndeposits as a result of the elevated interest\nrate environment. A portion of that shift\nincluded an increase in total brokered\ndeposits compared with 2022. Our total\nbrokered deposit balances of $11.0 billion in\n2023 and $9.5 billion in 2022, were\nsignificantly below both our internal and\nregulatory guidelines and limits.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 47\nBorrowed funds increased due to parent company\nsenior debt issuances and higher FHLB\nborrowings.\n\nThe level and composition of borrowed funds\nfluctuates over time based on many factors,\nincluding market conditions, capital\nconsiderations, and funding needs, which are\nprimarily driven by changes in loan, deposit\nand investment securities balances. While our\nlargest source of liquidity on a consolidated\nbasis is the customer deposit base generated\nby our banking businesses, we also manage our\nborrowed funds to provide a reliable source of\nliquidity for our banking and other\nactivities, considering our LCR and NSFR\nrequirements and other internal and external\nguidelines and constraints.

\u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin 2023 compared to 2022. Average consumer\nloans increased driven by higher residential\nreal estate and home equity loans as a result\nof new volume and draws on existing accounts\noutpacing liquidations, as well as growth in\ncredit card loans due to new account\nproduction and purchase volume increases. The\nincrease was partially offset by declines\nacross the remaining portfolio as paydowns\noutpaced new originations. Average commercial\nloans increased due to growth in automobile\ndealer segment balances, partially offset by\nforgiveness of PPP loans.\n\nOur focus on growing primary customer\nrelationships is at the core of our deposit\nstrategy in Retail, which is based on\nattracting and retaining stable, low-cost\ndeposits as a key funding source for PNC. We\nhave taken a disciplined approach to pricing,\nfocused on retaining relationship-based\nbalances and executing on targeted deposit\ngrowth and retention strategies aimed at more\nrate-sensitive customers. Our goal with regard\nto deposits is to optimize balances, economics\nand long-term customer growth. In 2023,\naverage total deposits decreased compared to\n2022, reflecting the impact of increased\nconsumer spending and quantitative tightening\nby the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe operate and continue to optimize a coast-\nto-coast network of retail branches, solution\ncenters and ATMs, which are complemented by\nPNC\u2019s suite of digital capabilities.

Average loans for\nthis business increased driven by strong new\nproduction throughout 2022 and the acquisition\nof capital commitment facilities from\nSignature Bridge Bank, N.A. on October 2,\n2023.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased largely due to new\nproduction throughout 2022, partially offset\nby a lower average utilization of loan\ncommitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is mainly secured by\nbusiness assets. Average loans for this\nbusiness increased, primarily driven by new\nproduction, partially offset by a lower\naverage utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by\nlower average utilization of loan commitments,\npaydowns outpacing new production and PPP loan\nforgiveness.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits decreased in 2023\ncompared to 2022, reflecting the impact of\nquantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve\nand included a continued shift from\nnoninterest-bearing to interest-bearing\ndeposits as deposit rates have risen. We\ncontinue to actively monitor the interest rate\nenvironment and make adjustments to our\ndeposit strategy in response to evolving\nmarket conditions, bank funding needs and\nclient relationship dynamics.\n                                              \n  Product Revenue                             \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital markets\nand advisory products and services, and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, for\ncustomers of all business segments. On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationships\nexist. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services. A discussion of the\nconsolidated revenue from these services\nfollows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nTreasury management revenue is reported in\nnoninterest income and net interest income.\nNoninterest income includes treasury\nmanagement product revenue less earnings\ncredits provided to customers on compensating\ndeposit balances used to pay for products and\nservices. Net interest income includes funding\ncredit from all treasury management customer\ndeposit balances. Compared with 2022, treasury\nmanagement revenue increased due to wider\ninterest rate spreads on the value of deposits\nand higher product revenue.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\n\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\n\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower commercial mortgage\nservicing income.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading. The decrease in\ncapital markets and advisory fees in the\ncomparison was mostly driven by lower merger\nand acquisition advisory fees and a decline in\nsyndication fees, partially offset by higher\ncustomer-related trading revenue for\nderivatives, foreign exchange and fixed\nincome.\n\n52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Asset Management Group                      \n                                              \nThe Asset Management Group strives to be a\nleading relationship-based provider of\ninvestment, planning, credit and cash\nmanagement solutions and fiduciary services to\naffluent individuals and institutions by\nendeavoring to proactively deliver value-added\nideas, solutions and exceptional service.

Accordingly, we\ndesign our risk governance framework, referred\nto as the ERM Framework, and risk management\nprocesses to help manage this risk. We manage\nrisk in light of our risk appetite to optimize\nlong-term shareholder value while supporting\nour employees, customers and communities.\n\nOur ERM Framework is structurally aligned with\nregulatory enhanced prudential standards and\nheightened standards promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve and OCC, respectively, which\nestablish minimum requirements for the design\nand implementation of a risk governance\nframework. This Risk Management section\ndescribes our ERM Framework, which consists of\nseven core components that provide executive\nmanagement and the Board of Directors with an\naggregate view of significant risks impacting\nthe organization. The seven core components\nare risk culture, enterprise strategy\n(including risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing), risk\ngovernance and oversight, risk identification,\nrisk assessments, risk controls and\nmonitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting\n(see the figure below). The overall Risk\nManagement section of this Item 7 also\nprovides an analysis of the firm\u2019s Capital\nManagement and our key areas of risk, which\ninclude, but are not limited to Credit,\nMarket, Liquidity and Operational (including\nCompliance and Information Security). Our use\nof financial derivatives as part of our\noverall asset and liability risk management\nprocess is also addressed within this Risk\nManagement section.\n\nWe operate within a rapidly evolving\nregulatory and financial services environment.\nAccordingly, we are actively focused on the\ntimely incorporation of applicable regulatory\npronouncements and emerging risks into our ERM\nFramework.\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Risk Culture                                \n                                              \nA strong risk culture helps us make well\ninformed decisions, helps ensure individuals\nconform to the established culture, reduces an\nindividual\u2019s ability to do something for\npersonal gain, and rewards employees for\nworking toward a common goal rather than\nindividual interests.

All employees\nare also responsible for understanding our\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM\nFramework and how risk management applies to\ntheir respective roles and responsibilities.\nEmployees are encouraged to collaborate across\ngroups to identify and mitigate risks and\nelevate issues as required. We reinforce risk\nmanagement responsibilities through a\nperformance management system where employee\nperformance goals include risk management\nobjectives and incentives for employees to\nreinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted\nperformance.\n\nProactive and open communication, between\ngroups and up to the Board of Directors,\nfacilitates timely identification and\nresolution of risk issues. Our multi-level\nrisk committee structure provides formal\nchannels to identify and report risk.\n                                              \n  Enterprise Strategy                         \n                                              \nWe seek to ensure that our overall enterprise\nstrategy is within acceptable risk parameters\nthrough our risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing processes.\nThese components are reviewed and approved at\nleast annually by the Board of Directors or\none of its committees.\n\nRisk Appetite : Our risk appetite represents\nthe organization\u2019s desired enterprise risk\nposition, set within our capital-based risk\nand liquidity capacity to achieve our\nstrategic objectives and business plans. The\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement\nqualitatively describes the aggregate level of\nrisk we are willing to accept in order to\nexecute our business strategies. Qualitative\nguiding principles further define each of the\nrisks within our taxonomy to support the risk\nappetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and\nlimits, including forward-looking metrics,\nquantitatively measure whether we are\noperating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our\nrisk appetite metrics reflect material risks,\nalign with our established Risk Appetite\nFramework, balance risk and reward, leverage\nanalytics, and are adjusted to changes in the\nexternal and internal risk environments.\n\nStrategic Planning : Our enterprise and line\nof business strategic plans outline major\nobjectives, strategies and goals which are\nexpected to be achieved over the next five\nyears while seeking to ensure we remain\ncompliant with all capital, risk appetite and\nliquidity targets and guidelines. Our chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer\nlead the development of the corporate\nstrategic plan.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing : Capital\nplanning helps to ensure we are maintaining\nsafe and sound operations and viability. The\ncapital planning process and the resulting\ncapital plan evolve as our overall risks,\nactivities and risk management practices\nchange. Capital planning aligns with our\nstrategic planning process. Stress testing is\nan essential element of the macroeconomic\ncapital planning process. Effective stress\ntesting enables us to consider the estimated\neffect on capital of various hypothetical\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance and Oversight               \n                                              \nWe employ a comprehensive risk management\ngovernance framework to help ensure that risks\nare identified, balanced decisions are made\nthat consider risk and return, and risks are\nadequately monitored and managed.

See the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report\nfor more information.\n\nTo help ensure appropriate risks are being\ntaken and effectively managed and controlled,\nrisk is managed across three lines of defense.\nA summary of the Board of Directors\u2019 and each\nline of defense\u2019s responsibilities is provided\nbelow:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 The Board of Directors\noversees our risk-taking activities, holds\nmanagement accountable for adhering to the ERM\nFramework and is responsible for exercising\nsound, independent judgment when assessing\nrisk.\n\nFirst line of defense \u2013 The front line units\nare accountable for identifying, owning and\nmanaging risks to within acceptable levels\nwhile adhering to the ERM Framework. Our\nbusinesses strive to enhance risk management\nand internal control processes within their\nareas. Integrated and comprehensive processes\nare designed to adequately manage the\nbusiness\u2019 risk profile and risk appetite\nthrough identifying, assessing, monitoring and\nreporting risks that may significantly impact\neach business.\n\nSecond line of defense \u2013 The second line of\ndefense is independent from the first line of\ndefense and is responsible for establishing\nthe risk governance framework and the\nstandards within each independent risk area\nfor identifying, measuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting aggregate risks. As\nthe second line of defense, the independent\nrisk areas monitor the risks generated by the\nfirst line of defense, review and challenge\nthe implementation of effective risk\nmanagement practices, perform independent\nassessment of risk, and report on issues or\nexceptions. The risk areas help to ensure\nprocesses and controls owned by the businesses\nare designed and operating as intended .\n\nThird line of defense \u2013 As the third line of\ndefense, Internal Audit is independent from\nthe first and second lines of defense.\nInternal Audit provides the Board of Directors\nand executive management comprehensive\nassurance on the effectiveness of the ERM\nFramework and the risk management practices\nacross the organization.\n\nWithin the three lines of defense, the\nindependent risk organization has sufficient\nauthority to influence material decisions. Our\nbusiness oversight and decision-making is\nsupported through a governance structure at\nthe Board of Directors and management level.\nSpecific responsibilities include:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 Our Board of Directors\noversees our business and affairs as managed\nby our officers and employees. The Board of\nDirectors may receive assistance in carrying\nout its duties and may delegate authority\nthrough standing or special committees. The\nfollowing provides a summary of some of the\nkey responsibilities of the Board\u2019s standing\ncommittees:\n\n\u2022 Audit Committee : monitors the integrity of\nour consolidated financial statements;\nmonitors internal control over financial\nreporting; monitors compliance with our code\nof ethics; evaluates and monitors the\nqualifications and independence of our\nindependent auditors; and evaluates and\nmonitors the performance of our Internal Audit\nfunction and our independent auditors.\n\n\u2022 Nominating and Governance Committee :\noversees the implementation of sound corporate\ngovernance principles and practices while\npromoting our best interests and those of our\nshareholders.\n\n\u2022 Human Resources Committee : oversees the\ncompensation of our executive officers and\nother specified responsibilities related to\ntalent and human capital matters affecting us.\nThe committee is also responsible for\nevaluating the relationship between risk-\ntaking activities and incentive compensation\nplans.\n\n\u2022 Risk Committee : oversees our enterprise-\nwide risk structure and the processes\nestablished to identify, measure, monitor and\nmanage the organization\u2019s risks and evaluates\nand approves our risk governance framework.\nThe Risk Committee has formed a Compliance\nSubcommittee to facilitate Board-level\noversight of risk management in the compliance\narea.\n\n\u2022 Corporate Responsibility Committee :\noversees management\u2019s corporate responsibility\nefforts, internally and externally, to the\nextent such corporate responsibility efforts\nare not specifically within the purview of\nanother Board committee (e.g., climate-related\nrisks overseen by the Risk Committee and\nclimate-related financial disclosures overseen\nby the Audit Committee), and implementation of\nPNC's publicly-announced Community Benefits\nPlan to provide loans, investments and other\nfinancial support to bolster economic\nopportunity for low- and moderate-income\nindividuals and communities and other\nunderserved individuals and communities, and\nto help remove historic barriers in the\nbanking system.\n\n\u2022 Technology Committee : oversees technology\nstrategy and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs, including those that\ncan position the use of technology to drive\nstrategic advantages, and fulfills the\noversight responsibilities delegated from the\nRisk Committee with respect to technology\nrisk, technology risk management, data risk,\ncybersecurity, information security, business\ncontinuity and significant technology\ninitiatives and programs.\n\nManagement Level Executive Committee \u2013 The\nManagement Level Executive Committee is\nresponsible for guiding the creation and\nexecution of our business strategy across PNC.\nWith this responsibility, the Management Level\nExecutive Committee executes various strategic\napproval and review activities, with a focus\non capital deployment, business performance\nand risk management. This Committee also helps\nensure PNC is staffed with sufficient\nresources and talent to operate within its\nrisk appetite.\n\n56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nCorporate Committees \u2013 The Corporate\nCommittees generally operate based on the\ndelegated approval authority from a Board-\nlevel Committee, the Management Level\nExecutive Committee or other Corporate\nCommittees. These Committees operate at the\nsenior management level and are designed to\nfacilitate the review, evaluation, oversight\nand approval of key business and risk\nactivities.\n\nWorking Committees \u2013 Working Committees\ngenerally operate on delegated approval\nauthority from a Corporate Committee or other\nWorking Committees. Working Committees are\nintended to provide oversight of\nregulatory/legal matters, assist in the\nimplementation of key enterprise-level\nactivities within a business or function and\nsupport the oversight of key risk activities.\n\nTransactional Committees \u2013 Transactional\nCommittees generally operate based on\ndelegated approval authority from a Corporate\nor Working Committee to approve individual\ntransactions, transactional related activities\nor movements on the organization\u2019s balance\nsheet.\n\nPolicies and Procedures \u2013 We have established\nrisk management Policies and Procedures to\nsupport our ERM Framework, articulate our risk\nculture, define the parameters and processes\nwithin which employees are to manage risk and\nconduct our business activities and to provide\ndirection, guidance and clarity on roles and\nresponsibilities to management and the Board\nof Directors. These Policies and Procedures\nare organized in a multi-tiered framework and\nrequire periodic review and approval by\nrelevant Committees, including where\nappropriate Committees of the Board of\nDirectors, or management.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nRisk identification takes place across a\nvariety of risk types throughout the\norganization. These risk types include, but\nare not limited to, credit, liquidity and\ncapital, market and operational (which\nincludes, among other types of risk,\ncompliance and information security). Risks\nare identified based on a balanced use of\nanalytical tools and management judgment for\nboth on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our\ngovernance structure supports risk\nidentification by facilitating assessment of\nkey risk issues, emerging risks and\nidiosyncratic risks and implementation of\nmitigation strategies as appropriate. These\nrisks are prioritized based on quantitative\nand qualitative analysis and assessed against\nour risk appetite. Multiple tools and\napproaches are used to help identify and\nprioritize risks, including Risk Appetite\nMetrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance\nIndicators, Risk and Control Self-Assessments,\nscenario analysis, stress testing and special\nassessments.\n\nRisks are aggregated and assessed within and\nacross risk functions and businesses. The\naggregated risk information is reviewed and\nreported at an enterprise level to the Board\nof Directors or appropriate committees. This\nenterprise aggregation and reporting approach\npromotes the identification and appropriate\nescalation of material risks across the\norganization and supports an understanding of\nthe cumulative impact of risk in relation to\nour risk appetite.\n                                              \n  Risk Assessment                             \n                                              \nOnce risks are identified, they are evaluated\nbased on quantitative and qualitative analysis\nto determine whether they are material. Risk\nassessments support the overall management of\nan effective ERM Framework and help us to\ncontrol and monitor our actual risk level and\nrisk management effectiveness. Comprehensive,\naccurate and timely assessments of risk are\nessential to an effective ERM Framework.\nEffective risk measurement practices are\ndesigned to uncover recurring risks that have\nbeen experienced in the past; facilitate the\nmonitoring, understanding, analysis and\nreporting of known risks; and reveal\nunanticipated risks that may not be easy to\nunderstand or predict.\n                                              \n   Risk Controls and Monitoring               \n                                              \nOur ERM Framework consists of policies,\nprocedures, processes, personnel and control\nsystems. Risk controls and limits provide the\nlinkage from our Risk Appetite Statement and\nassociated guiding principles to the risk-\ntaking activities of our businesses. In\naddition to risk appetite limits, a system of\nmore detailed internal controls exists which\noversees and monitors our various processes\nand functions. These control systems measure\nperformance, help employees make correct\ndecisions, help ensure information is accurate\nand reliable and facilitate compliance with\nlaws and regulations.\n\nWe design our monitoring and evaluation of\nrisks and controls to provide assurance that\npolicies, procedures and controls are\neffective and also to result in the\nidentification of control improvement\nrecommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily,\nongoing process used by both the first and\nsecond line of defense to help ensure\ncompliance with our ERM Framework. Risk\nmonitoring is accomplished in many ways,\nincluding performing risk assessments at the\nbusiness and risk assessment unit level,\nmonitoring an area\u2019s key controls, the timely\nreporting of issues and establishing a quality\ncontrol and/or quality assurance function, as\napplicable.\n                                              \n  Risk Aggregation and Reporting              \n                                              \nRisk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i)\ncommunicate aggregate risks, including\nidentified concentrations; (ii) escalate\ninstances where we are outside of our risk\nappetite; (iii) monitor our risk profile in\nrelation to our risk appetite; and (iv)\ncommunicate risks and views on the\neffectiveness of our risk management\nactivities to the Board of Directors and\nexecutive management.\n\nRisk reports are produced at the line of\nbusiness, functional risk and enterprise\nlevels. Each individual risk report includes\nan assessment of inherent risk, quality of\nrisk management, residual risk, risk appetite\nand risk outlook.

The\nenterprise risk profile is a point-in-time\nassessment of enterprise risk and represents\nour overall risk position in relation to the\ndesired enterprise risk appetite. The\ndetermination of the enterprise risk profile\nis based on analysis of quantitative reporting\nof risk limits and other measures along with\nqualitative assessments. Quarterly aggregation\nof risk reports from the risk areas and lines\nof business is designed to provide a clear\nview of our risk level relative to our risk\nappetite. The enterprise level report is\nprovided through the governance structure to\nthe Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk Management                      \n                                              \nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with the contractual\nterms of their loan, extension of credit or\nother financial obligation with PNC. Credit\nrisk is inherent in the financial services\nbusiness and results from extending credit to\ncustomers, purchasing securities and entering\ninto financial derivative transactions and\ncertain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is\none of our most significant risks. Our\nprocesses for managing credit risk are\ndesigned to be embedded in our risk culture\nand in our decision-making processes using a\nsystematic approach whereby credit risks and\nrelated exposures are identified and assessed,\nmanaged through specific policies and\nprocesses, measured and evaluated against our\nrisk appetite and credit concentration limits,\nand reported, along with specific mitigation\nactivities, to management and the Board of\nDirectors through our governance structure.\nOur most significant concentration of credit\nrisk is in our loan portfolio.\n\nCredit Risk Management is working to\nunderstand and incorporate into our credit\nrisk management framework the impacts to\ncredit risk that may accelerate or be\nintroduced as a result of climate change,\nincluding impacts from physical risk events\nand risks associated with the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy. These risk events may\nimpact a borrower\u2019s income, cash flow or\ncollateral due to the frequency or severity of\nweather events, changing market conditions,\nconsumer preferences and demand for products,\nor changes to the legislative and regulatory\nlandscape. As disruptive events occur, PNC\nfollows a process to determine if enhanced\nportfolio monitoring, reporting and executive\ncommunication is warranted to ensure\nappropriate oversight and action.\n\nTo address issues that are important to the\nvarious stakeholders we serve, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking transactions may be\nsubjected to an industry-agnostic\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management\nassessment designed to help us better identify\nand mitigate environmental, human rights and\nother reputational risks early in the credit\napplication process. Transactions identified\nas having a potential environmental, human\nrights or other reputational risk are\nevaluated to determine whether additional due\ndiligence is warranted. Credit Risk Management\nemploys a governance, policy and monitoring\nframework for environmental and social risk\ntopics that may include updates to PNC\u2019s\nCredit Portfolio Strategy Committee. Outcomes\nfrom those updates may be incorporated into\ncredit policies and risk procedures that\ngovern our risk appetite, credit decisioning,\nportfolio management and reserve processes.\nAdditionally, PNC has procedures designed to\nensure that flood insurance is present for\nproperties as required by applicable\nregulations, while also monitoring other\nwater-related risks (such as the increased\nshoreline and coastal erosion) and weather-\nrelated events (such as hurricanes and\nwildfires).\n                                              \n  Loan Portfolio Characteristics and          \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 15: Details of Loans                  \n                                              \nIn billions\n\n58 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators, as\nfurther detailed in Note 3 Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and\nmeasure our exposure to credit risk within our\nloan portfolio.

This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geographies that may exist in our\nportfolio.

Owner\noccupied commercial real estate loans are\nwell-diversified across industries.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate loans comprised $21.0\nbillion related to commercial mortgages on\nincome-producing properties, $8.0 billion of\nintermediate-term financing loans, and $6.4\nbillion of real estate construction project\nloans as of December 31, 2023. Comparable\namounts as of December 31, 2022 were $22.3\nbillion, $7.6 billion, and $6.4 billion,\nrespectively. Commercial real estate primarily\nconsists of an investment in land and/or\nbuildings held to generate income, that income\nserves as the primary source for the repayment\nof the loan. However, for all commercial real\nestate assets, the disposition of the assigned\ncollateral serves as a secondary source of\nrepayment for the loan should the borrower\nexperience cash generation difficulties.\n\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith commercial real estate loans tend to be\ncorrelated to the loan structure, collateral\nlocation and quality, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk.

Also, the portfolio is well\ndiversified geographically across our coast-\nto-coast franchise. Within the office\nportfolio at December 31, 2023, criticized\nloans totaled 24.8% and nonperforming loans\ntotaled 8.4%, while delinquencies were zero.\nAs measured at origination, the weighted\naverage LTV for the office portfolio was 58%;\nhowever, updated appraisals have increased the\nweighted average LTV to 65% as of December 31,\n2023. While LTV is one consideration, our risk\nassessment considers a number of factors in\nassessing the changing conditions affecting\nthe portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhave established reserves of 8.7% against\noffice loans.\n\nThe greatest stress in our office portfolio is\nobserved in multi-tenant office loans, which\nrepresents 56% of the portfolio at December\n31, 2023. Within the multi-tenant\nclassification, criticized levels were 43.4%\nwhile nonperforming loans totaled 14.5%,\naccounting for almost all of the nonperforming\noffice population. The weighted average LTV\nfor multi-tenant is 69% at December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, all of the commercial real\nestate charge-offs over the last year have\nbeen multi-tenant office loans. Given the\nhigher level of stress, this segment has a\nproportionally higher reserve rate of 12.9%.\nThe remaining 44% of the office portfolio is\nprimarily comprised of single-tenant, medical\nand government tenant properties. This subset\nof the portfolio is performing considerably\nbetter, with less than 1% of the book in the\ncriticized, delinquent and nonperforming loan\ncategories. As of December 31, 2023, the\nweighted average LTV of this book is 60%.\n\nPortfolio management efforts have escalated\nfor the office portfolio, with internal risk\nratings completed for each asset quarterly,\naccelerated reappraisal requirements and\nelevated approval levels for any credit action\n. Refreshed appraisals have updated valuations\non more than 90% of the criticized office\nexposure over the past year. Additionally,\nactive management efforts include ongoing\nperformance assessments as well as the review\nof property, lending and capital markets.\nPortfolio updates are distributed to senior\nmanagement weekly.\n\nGiven the ongoing change in this area, we\nexpect additional stress in the office sector.\nHowever, we continue to actively manage the\nportfolio, and we believe reserve levels\nadequately reflect the expected credit losses\nin the portfolio.\n\n60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  19\u2026    42    %    $  1\u2026     41   %  \n  \u2026       4,\u2026     8            4\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     2            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       989     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    19            8\u2026     18      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  47\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  772                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              73    %              71   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at December 31, 2023.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us. We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $42.4 billion at December 31,\n2023 with 45% located in California.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were\n$40.6 billion and 44%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $20.6 billion of\nhome equity lines of credit and $5.6 billion\nof closed-end home equity installment loans at\nDecember 31, 2023. Comparable amounts were\n$19.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of December\n31, 2022, respectively. Home equity lines of\ncredit are a variable interest rate product\nwith fixed rate conversion options available\nto certain borrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\ntrack borrower performance of this portfolio\non a monthly basis. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, legacy brokered home\nequity loans, home equity lines of credit or\nlegacy brokered home equity lines of credit)\nand track the historical performance of any\nrelated mortgage loans regardless of whether\nwe hold such liens. This information is used\nfor internal reporting and risk management. As\npart of our overall risk analysis and\nmonitoring, we also segment the portfolio\nbased upon loan delinquency, nonperforming\nstatus, modification and bankruptcy status,\nFICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes.

We maintain the ACL at an\nappropriate level for expected losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments.\n\nExpected losses are estimated primarily using\na combination of (i) the expected losses over\na reasonable and supportable forecast period,\n(ii) a period of reversion to long run average\nexpected losses, where applicable and (iii)\nlong run average expected losses for the\nremaining estimated contractual term.\n\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we have established a\nframework which includes a three-year forecast\nperiod and the use of four economic scenarios\nand associated probability weights, which in\ncombination create a forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes. Forward-looking\ninformation, such as forecasted relevant\nmacroeconomic variables, is incorporated into\nthe expected credit loss estimates using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, as well as\nthrough analysis from PNC\u2019s economists and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long-run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from available historical credit\ninformation. We use long-run average expected\nlosses for the portfolio over the estimated\nremaining contractual term beyond our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period and\nthe reversion period.\n\nThe following discussion provides additional\ninformation on our reserves for loans and\nleases as well as unfunded lending related\ncommitments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies\nfor further discussion on our ACL, including\ndetails of our methodologies and\n\n64 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\ndiscussion of the allowances for investment\nsecurities and other financial assets. See\nalso the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section of this Report for further\ndiscussion of the assumptions used in the\ndetermination of the ACL as of December 31,\n2023.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is\nbased upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD\nand the remaining estimated contractual term\nfor a loan, loan segment or lease. We also\nconsider the impact of prepayments and\namortization on the estimated contractual term\nin our expected loss estimates. We use\nhistorical data, current borrower\ncharacteristics and forecasted economic\nvariables in quantitative methods to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan, loan segment or\nlease. PDs represent a quantification of risk\nof the likelihood that a borrower may not be\nable to pay their contractual obligation over\na defined period of time. LGD describes the\nestimated magnitude of potential loss if a\nborrower were to default, and EAD (or\nutilization rates for certain revolving loans)\nis the estimated balance outstanding at the\nexpected time of default. These parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario and\nthe long-run average period, and are combined\nto generate expected loss estimates by\nscenario in proportion to the scenario\nweights.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our consumer real\nestate related loan classes and certain TDRs.\nEffective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our\nuse of the discounted cash flow methodology,\nand we now use a pooled expected credit loss\nmethodology as described above.\n\nFor loans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans, we\nestablish individually assessed reserves using\nmethods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for\nindividual commercial nonperforming loans\nexceeding a defined dollar threshold are based\non an analysis of the present value of the\nloan\u2019s expected future cash flows or the fair\nvalue of the collateral, if appropriate under\nour policy for collateral dependent loans.\nCommercial nonperforming loans that are below\nthe defined threshold are collectively\nreserved for, as we believe these loans\ncontinue to share similar risk\ncharacteristics. For consumer nonperforming\nloans classified as collateral dependent,\ncharge-off and ALLL related to recovery of\namounts previously charged-off are evaluated\nthrough an analysis of the fair value of the\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nWhile our reserve models and methodologies\nstrive to reflect all relevant expected credit\nrisk factors, there continues to be\nuncertainty associated with, but not limited\nto, potential imprecision in the estimation\nprocess due to the inherent time lag of\nobtaining information and normal variations\nbetween expected and actual outcomes. We may\nhold additional reserves that are designed to\nprovide coverage for losses attributable to\nsuch risks. A portion of the allowance is\nrelated to qualitative measurement factors.\nThese factors may include, but are not limited\nto:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable, ( e.g., unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees) at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\npooled loans and leases. The allowance for\nunfunded lending related commitments is\nrecorded as a liability on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve\nare included in the provision for credit\nlosses on the Consolidated Income Statement.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n

The second is the potential\ninability to operate our businesses because\nadequate contingent liquidity is not\navailable. We manage liquidity risk at the\nconsolidated company level (bank, parent\ncompany and all subsidiaries combined) to help\nensure that we can obtain cost-effective\nfunding to meet current and future obligations\nunder both normal \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and\nstressful circumstances, and to help ensure\nthat we maintain an appropriate level of\ncontingent liquidity. To ensure a strong\nliquidity position and compliance with\nregulatory requirements, management maintains\na liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and\nhighly liquid unencumbered securities.\n\nManagement monitors liquidity through a series\nof early warning indicators that may indicate\na potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity\nstress event. In addition, management performs\na set of internal liquidity stress tests over\nmultiple time horizons with varying levels of\nseverity and maintains a contingency funding\nplan to address a potential liquidity stress\nevent. In the most severe liquidity stress\nsimulation, we assume that our liquidity\nposition is under pressure, while the market\nin general is under systemic pressure. The\nsimulation considers, among other things, the\nimpact of restricted access to both secured\nand unsecured external sources of funding,\naccelerated runoff of customer deposits,\nvaluation pressure on assets and heavy demand\nto fund committed obligations. Parent company\nstress coverage limits and operating liquidity\nguidelines are designed to help ensure that\nsufficient liquidity is available to\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 67\nmeet our parent company obligations over the\nsucceeding 24-month period. Liquidity-related\nrisk limits and operating guidelines are\nestablished within our Enterprise Liquidity\nManagement Policy covering regulatory metrics\nand various concentration limits. Management\ncommittees, including the ALCO, and the Board\nof Directors and its Risk Committee regularly\nreview compliance with key established limits.\nPNC was in compliance with all relevant\ninternal and regulatory liquidity limits and\nguidelines during 2023.\n\nOne of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the year for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFluctuations in our average LCR result from\nchanges to the components of the calculation,\nincluding high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR daily and are required to\nmaintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. PNC and\nPNC Bank have maintained NSFR compliance since\nthe metric became effective on July 1, 2021.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of this Report.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding.

As of December 31, 2023,\nuninsured deposits represented approximately\n44% of our total deposit base. The majority of\nour uninsured deposits are related to\ncommercial operating and relationship\naccounts, which we define as commercial\ndeposit customers who utilize two or more PNC\nproducts. See the Funding Sources portion of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and\nBusiness Segments Review sections of this\nFinancial Review for additional information on\nour deposits and related strategies.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings). In addition,\nPNC joined the Federal Reserve\u2019s Standing Repo\nFacility on October 20, 2023, which allows\neligible banks, such as PNC Bank, to borrow\novernight in exchange for U.S Treasury, agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\nSee the Funding Sources section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet Review in this\nFinancial Review and Note 9 Borrowed Funds\nincluded in this Report for additional\ninformation related to our borrowings.\n\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, increased during 2023 due\nto the following activity:\n                                              \n  Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt      \n                                              \n                                         \n  In billions                      2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01               $  23.0        \n  Issuances                  10.5        \n  Calls and maturities       -2.3        \n  Other                       0.5        \n  December\u00a031             $  31.7        \n                                         \nAdditionally, certain liquid assets and unused\nborrowing capacity from a number of sources\nare also available to manage our liquidity\nposition. PNC has a contingency funding plan\ndesigned to ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of\nliquidity stress. This plan is designed to\nexamine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides the strategies for\naddressing liquidity needs and responsive\nactions we would consider during liquidity\nstress events, which could include the\nissuance of incremental debt, preferred stock,\nor additional deposit actions, including the\nissuance of brokered CDs. The plan also\naddresses the governance, frequency of\nreporting and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of liquidity stress.\n\n68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nPNC defines our primary contingent liquidity\nsources as cash held at the Federal Reserve\nBank, investment securities and unused\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal\nReserve Bank.

As of December\n31, 2023, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or issuing intercompany\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $20.6 billion.\nParent company liquidity is held in\nintercompany cash and investments. For\ninvestments with longer durations, the related\nmaturities are aligned with scheduled cash\nneeds, such as the maturity of parent company\ndebt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $6.3 billion at December 31,\n2023. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters for\nfurther discussion of these limitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Under the parent company\u2019s\n2014 commercial paper program, the parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At December 31, 2023,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 69\nThe following

Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. See additional discussion of this rule\nin the Supervision and Regulation section of\nItem 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on\napplicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d, PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and\na Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios.

As of the fourth\nquarter 2023, the projected balance sheet\ncomposition by the end of year one is\ngenerally consistent with the spot composition\nas of the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nDeposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are\nprimarily driven by changes in the Federal\nFunds rate, with the relationship between\ndeposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined\nas deposit beta. We define cumulative deposit\nbeta as the change in deposit rate paid on\ninterest bearing non-maturity deposits divided\nby the change in the upper level of the stated\nFederal Funds rate range since the first\nquarter of 2022, the start of the current\nrising rate cycle. As of December 2023, PNC\u2019s\ncumulative deposit beta was 44%, an increase\nfrom 31% at December 2022. For interest rate\nrisk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to\nadjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending\non market rate levels as well as other\nfactors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect\nhistorical experience and future expectations.\nOur scenario assumes that deposit betas\nslightly increase from current levels. Actual\ndeposit rate paid may differ from modeled\nprojections due to variables such as\ncompetition for deposits and customer\nbehavior.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 73\nAsset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment\nassumptions for both loan and investment\nportfolios. Mortgage and Home Equity\nportfolios utilize an industry standard model\nto drive estimated prepayments that increase\nin lower rate environments. Commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios assume static\nconstant prepayment rates that are consistent\nacross rate scenarios, as those portfolios\nhistorically do not exhibit significantly\ndifferent prepayment behaviors based upon the\nlevel of market rates.\n\nImpact of Derivatives : PNC uses interest rate\nderivatives to hedge floating rate commercial\nloans. PNC had $33.3 billion in receive fix /\npay float swaps as of December 31, 2023, with\na weighted average duration of 2.3 years and\nan average fixed rate of 2.1%. As of December\n31, 2023 PNC also had collars in place,\nreflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5\nbillion of floors, that are used to hedge\nthese commercial loans. Additionally, PNC\nutilizes receive fix / pay float swaps as a\nmeans of hedging fixed rate debt. See Note 15\nFinancial Derivatives for additional\ninformation on how we use derivatives to hedge\ncommercial loans and fixed rate debt.\n\nEVE sensitivity results for the fourth quarter\nof 2023 and 2022 follow:\n\nTable 32: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity\nAnalysis\n                                              \n                    Fourth         Fourth     \n                    Quarter       Quarter     \n                    2023             2022     \n  Economic                                    \n  Value of                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  Sensiti\u2026                                    \n  Simulat\u2026                                    \n  200                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point       -4.3  %                -5.1  %  \n  instant\u2026                                    \n  increase                                    \n  200                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point             (3.9)%         (3.1)%     \n  instant\u2026                                    \n  decrease                                    \n                                              \nEVE measures the present value of all\nprojected future cash flows associated with a\npoint-in-time balance sheet and does not\ninclude projected new volume. EVE sensitivity\nto interest rate changes is a complementary\nmetric to NII sensitivity analysis and\nrepresents an estimation of long-term interest\nrate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity\nby measuring the changes in the economic value\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments in response to an instantaneous\n+/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.\nSimilar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we\nincorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan\nprepayment assumptions. These methodologies\nare largely consistent between the EVE and NII\nsensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit\nattrition is a significant contributor to EVE\nsensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected\nbased on a dynamic model developed using long-\nterm historical deposit behavior in addition\nto management assumptions including\naccelerated attrition for pandemic related\nexcess deposits. PNC performs various\nsensitivity analyses to understand the impact\nof faster and slower deposit attrition on our\nrisk metrics, with the results reported to the\nALCO.\n\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2022, there\nhave been no material changes to our NII\nsensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,\nincluding data sources that drive assumptions\nsetting.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical correlations across different asset\nclasses. We calculate a diversified VaR at a\n95% confidence interval and the results for\n2023 and 2022 were within our acceptable\nlimits.\n\nTo help ensure the integrity of the models\nused to calculate VaR for each portfolio and\nenterprise-wide, we use a process known as\nbacktesting. The backtesting process consists\nof comparing actual observations of gains or\nlosses against the VaR levels that were\ncalculated at the close of the prior day. Our\nVaR measure assumes that exposures remain\nconstant and that recent market variability is\na good predictor of future variability. Actual\nobservations include customer-related revenue\nand intraday hedging, which helps to reduce\nlosses and can reduce the number of instances\nactual losses exceed the prior day VaR\nmeasure. There were no instances during 2023\nand 2022 under our diversified VaR measure\nwhere actual losses exceeded the prior-day VaR\nmeasure. Our portfolio and enterprise-wide VaR\nmodels utilize a historical approach with a\n500-day look-back period.\n\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $137\nmillion in 2023 compared with $382 million in\n2022 and is recorded in Capital markets and\nadvisory and Other interest income on our\nConsolidated Income Statement. The decrease\nwas primarily due to higher funding costs in\nthe derivative and security trading desks,\npartially offset by improved foreign exchange\nclient sales revenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

These unfunded\ncommitments are included in Other liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNote 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities has further\ninformation on tax credit investments.\n\nPrivate Equity and Other\n\nThe largest component of our other equity\ninvestments is our private equity portfolio.\nThe private equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $2.2\nbillion at December 31, 2023 and $1.8 billion\nat December 31, 2022, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, $2.0 billion was invested\ndirectly in a variety of companies, and $0.2\nbillion was invested indirectly through\nvarious private equity funds. See the\nSupervision and Regulation section in Item 1\nof this Report for discussion of the Volcker\nRule limitations on our interests in and\nrelationships with private funds.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares. Based upon the December 31, 2023 per\nshare closing price of $260.35 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.5 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 14 Fair Value and Note\n20 Legal Proceedings for additional\ninformation regarding our Visa agreements, and\nVisa\u2019s amendments to its Certificate of\nIncorporation to institute a conversion and\nexchange offer program that would release\ntransfer restrictions on portions of the Visa\nClass B common shares. The estimated value\ndoes not represent fair value of the Visa B\ncommon shares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $18 million in 2023 and $45\nmillion in 2022.\n                                              \n  Impact of Inflation                         \n                                              \nOur assets and liabilities are primarily\nfinancial in nature and typically have varying\nmaturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in\n\nprices do not affect the obligations to pay or\nreceive fixed and determinable amounts of\nmoney. However, during periods of inflation,\n\nthere may be a subsequent impact affecting\ncertain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of\nconsumer and customer purchasing power,\n\nand fluctuations in the need or demand for our\nproducts and services. When significant levels\nof inflation occur, our business could\n\npotentially be impacted by, among other\nthings, reducing our tolerance for extending\ncredit or causing us to incur additional\ncredit\n\nlosses resulting from possible increased\ndefault rates. Throughout 2023, the Federal\nReserve monetary policy has tightened with the\nintent to slow inflation, which has led to\nlarger increases in interest rates. See Risk\nFactors in Item 1A, our Executive Summary and\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nstatements in this Item 7 for further\ndiscussion of inflation and its overall impact\nto the economy, our borrowers\u2019 ability to\nrepay their obligations and certain costs and\nexpenses to PNC.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 75\nnotional and an underlying as specified in the\ncontract. Therefore, cash requirements and\nexposure to credit risk are significantly less\nthan the notional amount on these instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15\nFinancial Derivatives.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk Management                 \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to the current or\nprojected financial condition and resilience\narising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses or systems, human errors or\nmisconduct or adverse external events.\nOperational risk is inherent to the entire\norganization.\n\nOperational risk management is embedded in our\nculture and decision-making processes through\na systematic approach whereby operational\nrisks and exposures are: (i) identified and\nassessed; (ii) managed through the design and\nimplementation of controls; (iii) measured and\nevaluated against our risk tolerance limits;\nand (iv) appropriately reported to management\nand the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. Strong operational risk management\nand well-informed risk-based decisions benefit\nus by improving the customer experience,\nenhancing compliance, reducing reputational\nrisk, minimizing losses and establishing an\nappropriate amount of required operational\nrisk capital held by us.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is\ndesigned to provide effective and consistent\nmanagement of operational risk. The primary\npurpose of the framework is to enable us to\nunderstand our operational risks and manage\nthem to the desired risk profile, in line with\nour Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance\nestablished within the framework assists\nmanagement in making well-informed risk-based\nbusiness decisions.\n\nThe framework provides a disciplined and\nstructured process for us to manage\noperational risk across eight operational risk\ndomains. These domains provide a comprehensive\nview of operational risk and allow us to\ndiscuss operational risk in a standard way,\nfacilitating reporting and ongoing risk\nmitigation.\n\nThe operational risk domains are:\n\n\u2022 Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate\nor failed internal processes, misconduct or\nerrors of people or fraud.\n\n\u2022 Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory\nsanctions, financial loss, or damage to\nreputation resulting from failure to comply\nwith laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory\nstandards or other regulatory requirements.\n\n\u2022 Data Management: Risk associated with\nincomplete or inaccurate data.\n\n\u2022 Model: Risk associated with the design,\nimplementation and ongoing use and management\nof models.\n\n\u2022 Technology and Systems: Risk associated with\nthe use, operation and adoption of technology.\n\n\u2022 Information Security: Risk resulting from\nthe failure to protect information and ensure\nappropriate access to, and use and handling\nof, information assets.\n\n\u2022 Business Continuity: Risk of potential\ndisruptive events to business activities.\n\n\u2022 Third Party: Risk arising from failure of\nthird-party providers to conduct activity in a\nsafe and sound manner and in compliance with\ncontract provisions and applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nWe utilize operational risk management\nprograms within the framework, including Risk\nand Control Self-Assessments, scenario\nanalysis, and internal and external loss event\nreviews and analysis, to assess existing\nrisks, determine potential/emerging risks and\nevaluate the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols. Program tools and methodology assist\nour business managers in identifying potential\nrisks and control gaps.\n\nLines of business are responsible for\nidentifying, owning, managing and monitoring\nthe operational risks and controls associated\nwith their business activities and product or\nservice offerings to within acceptable levels.\nCentralized functions, such as Business\nContinuity, Enterprise Third Party Management\nand Information Security, are responsible for\nthe development, implementation and management\nof their individual programs and for the\ndevelopment and maintenance of the policies,\nprocedures, methodologies, tools and\ntechnology utilized across the enterprise to\nidentify, assess, monitor and report program\nrisks. Additionally, independent risk\nmanagement reviews and challenges line of\nbusiness adherence to the framework to help\nensure proper controls are in place and\nappropriate risk mitigation plans are\nestablished as necessary.\n                                              \n  Conduct, Reputational and Strategic Risk    \n                                              \nPNC\u2019s risk culture seeks to reinforce the\nappropriate protocols for responsible and\nethical behavior through sound processes and\ncontrols. In order to promote a robust risk\nculture, the Board and executive management\nestablish code of conduct and professional\nstandards to which all employees must adhere.\nA strong risk culture discourages misconduct\nand supports conduct risk management at PNC.\nConduct risk is defined as the risk that\nemployees fail to comply with the ethical\nstandards expected of them. Strong conduct\n\n76 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nrisk management is important in supporting\nPNC\u2019s reputation, and PNC maintains a\ncorporate culture that emphasizes complying\nwith laws, regulations, and managing\nreputational risks. Reputational risk is the\nrisk to the franchise and/or shareholder value\nbased on a negative perception of PNC by its\nstakeholders and/or the changing expectations\nof its stakeholders. Strategic risk is another\ncomponent of the ERM Framework that is also\ncritical to optimizing shareholder returns.\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings that\nmay arise from adverse business decisions,\nimproper implementation of business decisions\nand/or inadequate response to changes in the\nbusiness environment. Strategic risk is\nconsidered and assessed by our businesses in\nthe annual strategic planning processes and\nmonitored on an on-going basis as those plans\nare carried out.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nEnterprise Compliance is responsible for\noversight of compliance risk for the\norganization. Compliance issues are identified\nand tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring\nand testing activities. Compliance risk issues\nare escalated through a comprehensive risk\nreporting process at both a business and\nenterprise level and incorporated, as\nappropriate, into the development and\nassessment of our operational risk profile. A\nmanagement committee, chaired by the Chief\nCompliance Officer, is responsible for\noversight of compliance and fiduciary risk\nmanagement programs across PNC. Enterprise\nCompliance, through the Regulatory Change\nProgram, helps PNC understand and proactively\naddress emerging regulatory topics and risks\nas well as respond to changes in applicable\nlaws and regulations. To understand emerging\nissues impacting the industry, Enterprise\nCompliance communicates regularly with various\nregulators having supervisory or regulatory\nresponsibilities with respect to us, our\nsubsidiaries, or businesses and participates\nin forums focused on regulatory and compliance\nmatters in the financial services industry.\n                                              \n  Information Security Risk                   \n                                              \nThe Information Security component of our\nOperational Risk Management Framework is\nresponsible for protecting information assets\nto achieve business objectives, which includes\ncybersecurity. PNC\u2019s cybersecurity program is\ndesigned to identify risks to sensitive\ninformation, protect that information, detect\nthreats and events and maintain an appropriate\nresponse and recovery capability to help\nensure resilience against information security\nincidents. The program includes, among other\nthings, annual security and privacy training\nfor all PNC employees and quarterly phishing\nexercises to raise employee awareness. Our\nsecurity program is also regularly examined by\nfederal regulators for compliance with\nfinancial regulations and standards. The\nprogram also establishes expectations for\ninformation asset management, system\ndevelopment security, identity and access\nmanagement, incident management, threat and\nvulnerability management, security operations\nmanagement and third- and fourth-party\nsecurity.

Note 1 Accounting Policies describes\nthe most significant accounting policies that\nwe use. Certain of these policies require us\nto make estimates or economic assumptions that\nmay vary under different assumptions or\nconditions, and such variations may\nsignificantly affect our reported results and\nfinancial position for the period or in future\nperiods.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected prepayments\nand estimated recoveries. Our determination of\nthe ACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We\nincorporate qualitative factors in the ACL\nthat reflect our best estimate of expected\nlosses that may not be adequately represented\nin our quantitative methods or economic\nassumptions. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to the\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and the timing of peak business\ncycles reflected by the scenarios could\nmaterially affect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio\nvolume and mix could materially affect our\nestimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 77\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\nAccounting Policies.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework that includes a three-year\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios with associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes. Credit losses\nestimated in our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of the scenarios used and weights\nassigned to them.\n\nTo forecast the distribution of economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then\ngiven an associated probability (weight) to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the forecast period. This\nprocess is informed by current economic\nconditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s RAC. This\napproach seeks to provide a reasonable\nrepresentation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate\nexpected credit losses across a variety of\nloans, securities and other financial assets.\nEach quarter, the scenarios are presented to\nRAC for approval, and the committee also\napproves CECL scenario weights for use during\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023 consider, among other\nfactors, the ongoing inflationary pressures\nand the corresponding tightening of monetary\npolicy and credit availability.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nTable 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2023                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. real             0.1%    1.5%    2.0%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.5%    4.6%    4.2%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2022                  \n                        2023    2024    2025  \n  U.S. real           (0.4)%    1.4%    1.9%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.9%    4.9%    4.4%  \n  Rate (c)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss)\nrates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively.\n\n(c) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to slow from 3.1%\nin 2023 to just 0.1% in 2024 on a weighted\naverage basis, with the slow down driven\nprimarily by our most likely scenario that the\nU.S. economy enters a mild recession during\nthe year. Growth then rises to 1.5% in 2025,\nbefore growing to 2.0% in 2026. The weighted\naverage unemployment rate is expected to\nincrease throughout 2024, peaking at 4.7%\nduring the first half of 2025 and gradually\nimproving to 4.2% by the fourth quarter of\n2026.\n\nThe current state of the economy reflects\nheightened uncertainty due to structural and\nsecular changes fostered by the pandemic for\ncertain sectors of the economy, such as\ncommercial real estate, combined with\ninflation, interest rate movements and\ndeclining consumer savings and deposit\nbalances. As such, for both our commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and\nperformed significant analysis around segments\nimpacted by such uncertainties to ensure our\nreserves are adequate, given our current\nmacroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nadequately reflect the expected credit losses\nin the portfolio as of the balance sheet date.\n\nTo provide additional context regarding the\nsensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic\nforecast of expected economic outcomes, we\nconsidered what our ACL would be when applying\na 100% probability weighting to the most\nsevere downside CECL scenario. This severe\ndownside scenario estimated that real GDP\ncontracted in 2024 ending the year down 2.0%\ncompared to 2023 levels, with\n\n78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\ngrowth picking up again by the end of 2025.\nThe unemployment rate in this scenario\nincreased to end 2024 at 6.3%, then peaks at\n7.1% in the second half of 2025, before\ngradually improving to 6.0% by the end of\n2026. Excluding consideration of qualitative\nadjustments, this sensitivity analysis would\nresult in a hypothetical increase in our ACL\nof $1.7 billion at December 31, 2023. This\nscenario does not reflect our current\nexpectation at December 31, 2023, nor does it\ncapture all the potential unknown variables\nthat could arise in the forecast period, but\nit provides an approximation of a possible\noutcome under hypothetical severe conditions.\nThe CECL methodology inherently requires a\nhigh degree of judgment, and as a result, it\nis possible that we may, at another point in\ntime, reach different conclusions regarding\nour credit loss estimates.\n\nSee the following for additional details on\nthe components of our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Item 7, and\n\n\u2022 Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 2\nInvestment Securities, and Note 3 Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses.\n\nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing\nRights\n\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value.\nThis election was made to be consistent with\nour risk management strategy to hedge changes\nin the fair value of these assets. The fair\nvalue of our MSRs is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model that\ncalculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into\nconsideration actual and expected mortgage\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs, and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\n\nWe employ risk management strategies designed\nto protect the value of MSRs from changes in\ninterest rates and related market factors. The\nvalues of the MSRs are economically hedged\nwith securities and derivatives, including\ninterest-rate swaps, options, and forward\nmortgage-backed and futures contracts. As\ninterest rates change, these financial\ninstruments are expected to have changes in\nfair value inverse to the change in fair value\nof the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge\nrelationships are actively managed in response\nto changing market conditions over the life of\nthe MSRs. Selecting appropriate financial\ninstruments to economically hedge residential\nor commercial MSRs requires significant\nmanagement judgment to assess how rates and\nprepayment speeds could affect the future\nvalues of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently\nbe less predictable in the short term, but\nover longer periods of time, they are expected\nto protect the economic value of the MSRs.\n\nFor information on how each estimate has\nchanged and a sensitivity analysis of the\nhypothetical effect of the fair value of MSRs\nto immediate adverse changes in key\nassumptions, see Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage\nServicing Rights. For additional information\non our residential and commercial MSRs, see\nNote 1 Accounting Policies, Note 5 Goodwill\nand Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 14 Fair\nValue.\n                                              \n  Fair Value Measurements - Level 3           \n                                              \nWe must use estimates, assumptions and\njudgments when assets and liabilities are\nrequired to be recorded at, or adjusted to\nreflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value inherently result in a\nhigher degree of financial statement\nvolatility. When observable price and third-\nparty information is not available, we\nestimate fair value primarily by using cash\nflow and other financial modeling techniques.\nChanges in underlying factors, assumptions, or\nestimates in any of these valuation techniques\ncould materially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nWe apply ASC 820 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\nThis guidance defines fair value as the price\nthat would be received to sell a financial\nasset or paid to transfer a financial\nliability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nThis guidance requires a three-level hierarchy\nfor disclosure of assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value. The classification of\nassets and liabilities within the hierarchy is\nbased on whether the inputs to the valuation\nmethodology used in the measurement are\nobservable or unobservable. Level 3 assets and\nliabilities are those where the fair value is\nestimated using significant unobservable\ninputs. An asset or liability\u2019s classification\nas Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the\nspecific facts and circumstances associated\nwith each instrument, and management applies\njudgment regarding the significance of\nunobservable inputs to each asset or liability\nwhen determining its fair value level\nclassification. In addition to MSRs, certain\nof our private equity investments and\navailable for sale securities have a high\nlevel of estimation uncertainty and require\nsignificant management judgment to determine\nthe fair value. While estimating potential\nsensitivities around fair value measurements\nis inherently challenging, we provide a\nsummary of the key unobservable inputs as well\nas additional information on Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements in Note 14 Fair Value.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 79\n                                              \n  Recently Issued Accounting Standards        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022 Required                   \n                 with                         \n                 issuance of                  \n                 2024 Form                    \n                 10-K; early                  \n                 adoption is                  \n                 permitted.                   \n                 \u2022 Requires                   \n                 that a                       \n                 public                       \n                 entity                       \n                 disclose                     \n                 significant                  \n                 segment                      \n                 expenses                     \n                 that are                     \n                 regularly                    \n                 provided to                  \n                 the chief                    \n                 operating                    \n                 decision                     \n                 maker                        \n                 (CODM) and                   \n                 included                     \n                 within each                  \n                 reported                     \n                 measure of                   \n                 segment                      \n                 profit or                    \n                 loss.                        \n                 \u2022 Requires                   \n                 that a                       \n                 public                       \n                 entity                       \n                 disclose an                  \n                 amount for                   \n                 other                        \n                 segment                      \n                 items by                     \n                 reportable                   \n                 segment and                  \n                 a                            \n                 description                  \n                 of its         \u2022 We are      \n                 compositio\u2026    currently     \n                 \u2022 Requires     evaluating    \n                 that a         the           \n                 public         disclosure    \n                 entity         requirements  \n                 provide all    within this   \n                 annual         ASU and do    \n                 disclosures    not plan to   \n                 about a        early adopt.  \n                 reportable     \u2022 This ASU    \n                 segment\u2019s      will not      \n                 profit or      impact our    \n                 loss and       Consolidated  \n                 assets         Income        \n                 currently      Statement,    \n  Improvemen\u2026    required by    Consolidated  \n  to             ASC 280 in     Balance       \n  Reportable     interim        Sheet,        \n  Segment        periods.

may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d

numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\n\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\n\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline forecast is for slower\neconomic growth in 2024 as consumer spending\ngrowth slows and higher interest rates remain\na drag on the economy. The ongoing strength of\nthe labor market will continue to support\nconsumer spending. Slowing inflation will\nallow for federal funds rate cuts starting in\nthe late spring or early summer; this will\nsupport economic growth in the second half of\n2024.\n\n\u2013 GDP growth this year will be below trend at\nslightly above 1%, and the unemployment rate\nwill increase modestly to somewhat above 4% by\nthe end of 2024. Inflation will continue to\nslow as wage pressures abate, moving back to\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective\nby the end of the year.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain\nunchanged in the first part of 2024, between\n5.25% and 5.50%, with federal funds rate cuts\nstarting in May 2024 as inflation slows\nfurther. PNC expects the federal funds rate to\nend 2024 between 4.25% and 4.50%.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, its\nfinancial performance, the scope and terms of\nfinal capital regulations then in effect and\nmanagement actions affecting the composition\nof PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In addition, PNC\u2019s\nability to determine, evaluate and forecast\nregulatory capital ratios, and to take actions\n(such as capital distributions) based on\nactual or forecasted capital ratios, will be\ndependent at least in part on the development,\nvalidation and regulatory review of related\nmodels and the reliability of and risks\nresulting from extensive use of such models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities.

We also have audited the\nCompany's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2023 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCOSO.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinions                          \n                                              \nThe Company's management is responsible for\nthese consolidated financial statements, for\nmaintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate .\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matter communicated below\nis a matter arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 83\ncommunication of critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter\nor on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\n\nAllowance for Loans and Lease Losses \u2013\nCommercial Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loans and lease losses was\napproximately $4,791 million as of December\n31, 2023, of which $3,259 million relates to\ncommercial loans. For commercial loans, the\ndetermination of the allowance is based on\nhistorical loss experience, current borrower\nrisk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\neconomic forecasts and other relevant factors.\nAs disclosed by management, the Company\nconsiders reasonable and supportable forecasts\nin estimating expected credit losses and has\nestablished a framework which includes the use\nof four economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. To generate the four economic\nforecast scenarios, the Company uses a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic\nmodels, other measures of economic activity\nand forward-looking judgment to forecast the\ndistribution of economic outcomes. Management\nused a number of economic variables in the\nscenarios, which are inputs into the loss\nforecasting models, with the most significant\ndrivers being Real GDP and U.S. unemployment\nrate. Also included in the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans are\nqualitative reserves to cover losses that are\nexpected but, in the Company\u2019s assessment, may\nnot be adequately represented in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. For example, qualitative factors\nmay include industry concentration and\nconditions, changes in market conditions,\nchanges in the nature and volume of the\nCompany\u2019s portfolio, recent credit quality\ntrends, recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, recent macroeconomic factors,\nlimitations of available input data, model\nimprecision, changes in lending policies, and\nother factors.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in developing\neconomic forecast scenarios of Real GDP and\nU.S. unemployment rate, determining weighting\nof each scenario, and estimating qualitative\nreserves, (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in evaluating audit\nevidence related to management\u2019s significant\njudgements and estimations, and (iii) the\naudit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans,\nincluding controls over the development and\napproval of economic forecast scenarios,\nrelated weightings, and qualitative reserves.\nThese procedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for determining\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans, including (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness and methodology of certain\nloss forecasting models, (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain borrower risk\ncharacteristics, (iii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain forecasted economic\nvariables, including Real GDP and U.S.\nunemployment rate, (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s weighting of\neconomic forecast scenarios used in the loss\nforecast models, (v) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the estimate, and\n(vi) evaluating certain qualitative reserves\nmade to the model output results to determine\nthe overall allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans. The procedures\nalso included the involvement of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist\nin evaluating certain models, model inputs,\neconomic forecasts, and qualitative reserves\nin the allowance for commercial loans.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since\n2007.\n\n84

PNC paid $\n11.5billion in cash as consideration for the\nacquisition.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC\nBank. On October 12, 2021, PNC converted\napproximately 2.6million customers,\n9,000employees and over 600branches across\nsevenstates. Our results of operations and\nbalance sheets for all periods presented in\nthis Report reflect the benefit of BBVA\u2019s\nacquired businesses for the period since the\nacquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior-year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nNoninterest Income Presentation\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nupdated the presentation of its noninterest\nincome categorization to be based on product\nand service type, and accordingly, has changed\nthe basis of presentation of its noninterest\nincome revenue streams to: (i) Asset\nmanagement and brokerage, (ii) Capital markets\nrelated, (iii) Card and cash management, (iv)\nLending and deposit services, (v) Residential\nand commercial mortgage and (vi) Other\nnoninterest income. Additionally, in the\nfourth quarter of 2022, PNC updated the name\nof the noninterest income line item \u201cCapital\nmarkets related\u201d to \u201cCapital markets and\nadvisory.\u201d This update did not impact the\ncomponents of the category. All periods\npresented herein reflect these changes. A\ndescription of each revenue stream follows:\nAsset management and brokerage includes\nrevenue from our asset management and retail\nbrokerage businesses. Asset management\nservices include investment management,\ncustody, retirement planning, family planning,\ntrust management and retirement\nadministration. Brokerage services offer\nretail customers a wide range of investment\noptions, including mutual funds, annuities,\nstock, bonds and managed accounts.\nCapital markets and advisory includes revenue\nfrom services and activities primarily related\nto merger and acquisition advisory, equity\ncapital markets advisory, asset-backed\nfinancing, loan syndication, securities\nunderwriting, credit valuation adjustments\nrelated to the derivatives portfolio and\ncustomer-related trading.\nCard and cash management includes revenue\nprimarily from debit and credit card\nactivities, inclusive of credit card points\nand rewards, treasury management services and\nATM fees. Debit and credit card activities\ninclude interchange revenue and merchant\nservice fees. Treasury management services\ninclude cash and investment management,\nreceivables and disbursement management, funds\ntransfer, international payment and access to\nonline/mobile information management and\nreporting.\nLending and deposit services includes revenue\nprimarily related to service charges on\ndeposits, loan commitment and usage fees, the\nissuance of standby letters of credit,\noperating lease income and long-term care and\ninsurance products.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 91\nResidential and commercial mortgage includes\nthe gain and loss on sale of mortgages,\nrevenue related to our mortgage servicing\nresponsibilities, mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation adjustments and net gains on\noriginations and sales of loans held for sale.\n\nOther noninterest income is primarily composed\nof private equity revenue, net securities\ngains and losses, activity related to our\nequity investment in Visa, including related\nswaps and gains and losses on asset sales.\n\nSee Note 23 Fee-based Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers for additional details related\nto these revenue streams within the scope of\nASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers .\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a primary\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nInvestments\nWe hold interests in various types of\ninvestments. The accounting for these\ninvestments is dependent on a number of\nfactors including, but not limited to, items\nsuch as:\n\u2022 Ownership interest,\n\u2022 Our plans for the investment, and\n\u2022 The nature of the investment.\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date\nbasis. We classify debt securities as either\ntrading, held to maturity or available for\nsale. Debt securities that we purchase for\ncertain risk management activities or\ncustomer-related trading activities are\nclassified as trading securities, are reported\nin the Other assets line item on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and are carried at\nfair value. For debt securities classified as\ntrading, realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses within our Capital markets business are\nincluded in Capital markets and advisory\nnoninterest income; other realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are included in\nOther noninterest income. We classify debt\nsecurities as held to maturity when we have\nthe positive intent and ability to hold the\nsecurities to maturity, and carry them at\namortized cost, less any allowance. Debt\nsecurities not classified as held to maturity\nor trading are classified as securities\navailable for sale and are carried at fair\nvalue. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale securities are included in\nAOCI net of income taxes.\nWe include all interest on debt securities,\nincluding amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on investment\nsecurities, in net interest income using the\nconstant effective yield method generally\ncalculated over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities. Effective yields reflect either\nthe effective interest rate implicit in the\nsecurity at the date of acquisition or, for\ndebt securities where an OTTI was recorded,\nthe effective interest rate determined based\non improved cash flows subsequent to an\nimpairment. We compute gains and losses\nrealized on the sale of available for sale\ndebt securities on a specific security basis.\nThese securities gains and losses are included\nin Other noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\nThe CECL standard requires expected credit\nlosses on both held to maturity and available\nfor sale securities to be recognized through a\nvaluation allowance, ACL, instead of as a\ndirect write-down to the amortized cost basis\nof the security. An available for sale\nsecurity is considered impaired if the fair\nvalue is less than its amortized cost basis.\nIf any portion of the decline in fair value is\nrelated to credit, the amount of allowance is\ndetermined as the portion related to credit,\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis and the fair value of the\nsecurity. If we have the intent to sell, or\nbelieve it is more likely than not we will be\nrequired to sell an impaired available for\nsale security before recovery of the amortized\ncost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a\ndirect write-down of the amortized cost basis.\nCredit losses on investment securities are\nrecognized through the Provision for credit\nlosses on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nDeclines in the fair value of available for\nsale securities that are not considered credit\nrelated are recognized in AOCI on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe consider a security to be past due in terms\nof payment based on its contractual terms. A\nsecurity may be placed on nonaccrual, with\ninterest no longer recognized until received,\nwhen collectability of principal or interest\nis doubtful. As of December 31, 2023,\nnonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity and\navailable-for-sale securities were immaterial.\n92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nA security may be partially or fully charged\noff against the allowance if it is determined\nto be uncollectible, including for an\navailable for sale security, if we have the\nintent to sell or believe it is more likely\nthan not we will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of the amortized cost\nbasis. Recoveries of previously charged-off\navailable for sale securities are recognized\nwhen received, while recoveries on held to\nmaturity securities are recognized when\nexpected.\n\nSee the Allowance for Credit Losses section of\nthis Note 1 for further discussion regarding\nthe methodologies used to determine the\n\nallowance for investment securities. See Note\n2 Investment Securities for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio and the related ACL.\n\nEquity Securities and Partnership Interests\n\nWe account for equity securities, equity\ninvestments, private equity investments, and\ninvestments in limited partnerships, limited\nliability companies and other investments that\nare not required to be consolidated under one\nof the following methods:\n\n\u2022 We use the equity method for general and\nlimited partner ownership interests and\nlimited liability companies in which we are\nconsidered to have significant influence over\nthe operations of the investee. Under the\nequity method, we record our equity ownership\nshare of net income or loss of the investee in\nNoninterest income and any dividends received\non equity method investments are recorded as a\nreduction to the investment balance. When an\nequity investment experiences an other-than-\ntemporary decline in value, we record a loss\non the investment.\n\n\u2022 We measure equity securities that have a\nreadily determinable fair value at fair value\nthrough Net income. We do not consider\ncontractual restrictions on the sale of an\nequity security when measuring fair value.\nBoth realized and unrealized gains and losses\nare included in Noninterest income. Dividend\nincome on these equity securities is included\nin Other interest income on our Consolidated\nIncome Statement.\n\n\u2022 We generally use the practicability\nexception to fair value measurement for all\nother investments without a readily\ndeterminable fair value. When we elect this\nalternative measurement method, the investment\nis recorded at cost and the carrying value is\nadjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus\nchanges in value resulting from observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for\nidentical or similar instruments of the same\nissuer. Adjustments to fair value based on\nchanges in observable price are recorded in\nOther noninterest income. These investments\nare written down to fair value if a\nqualitative assessment indicates impairment\nand the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue. The amount of the write-down is\naccounted for as a loss included in Other\nnoninterest income. Distributions received on\nthese investments are included in Other\nnoninterest income.\n\nInvestments described above are included in\nEquity investments on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\nPrivate Equity Investments\n\nWe report private equity investments, which\ninclude direct investments in companies,\naffiliated partnership interests and indirect\ninvestments in private equity funds, at\nestimated fair value. These estimates are\nbased on available information and may not\nnecessarily represent amounts that we will\nultimately realize through distribution, sale\nor liquidation of the investments. Fair values\nof publicly-traded direct investments are\ndetermined using quoted market prices and are\nsubject to various discount factors arising\nfrom security level restrictions, when\nappropriate. The valuation procedures applied\nto direct investments and indirect investments\nare detailed in Note 14 Fair Value. We include\nall private equity investments within Equity\ninvestments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in fair value of private equity\ninvestments are recognized in Other\nnoninterest income.\n\nWe consolidate affiliated partnerships when we\nhave determined that we have control of the\npartnership or are the primary beneficiary if\nthe entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own\nis reflected in Noncontrolling interests on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due are considered\ndelinquent. The CARES Act credit reporting\nrules, which required exceptions to this\npolicy, expired in the third quarter of 2023.\nAs such, delinquency status at December 31,\n2023 is being reported for all loans based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Prior\nperiod amounts continue to be presented in\naccordance with the credit reporting rules\nunder the CARES Act, which required certain\nloans modified due to pandemic-related\nhardships to not be reported as past due based\non the contractual terms of the loan, even\nwhen borrowers may not have made payments on\ntheir loans during the modification period.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 93\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method over the\ncontractual life. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method,\nover the contractual life of the loan. The\nprocessing fee received for loans originated\nthrough PPP lending under the CARES Act is\ndeferred and accreted into Net interest income\nusing the effective yield method, over the\ncontractual life of the loan. Loans under the\nfair value option are reported at their fair\nvalue, with any changes to fair value reported\nas Noninterest income on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement and are excluded from\nmeasurement of ALLL.\n\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination ( i.e. , PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe acquisition date. PNC considers a variety\nof factors in connection with the\nidentification of more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality, including but\nnot limited to nonperforming status,\ndelinquency, risk ratings and other\nqualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that are attributable, at least in\npart, to credit quality are recognized through\na charge to the provision for credit losses\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nare recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL .\n\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\n\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, or when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to measure the loan at the estimated\nfair value of collateral (less costs to sell\nif sale or foreclosure of the property is\nexpected).\n\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02\nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures (ASU 2022-02), which eliminates\nthe accounting guidance for TDRs and replaces\nTDRs with loan modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty, or FDMs.\nFDMs occur as a result of our loss mitigation\nactivities. A variety of solutions are offered\nto borrowers, including loan modifications\nthat may result in principal forgiveness,\ninterest rate reductions, term extensions,\npayment delays, repayment plans or\ncombinations thereof:\n\n\u2022 Principal forgiveness includes principal and\naccrued interest forgiveness.\n\n\u2022 Interest rate reductions include\nmodifications where the interest rate is\nreduced and/or interest is deferred.\n\n\u2022 Term extensions extend the original\ncontractual maturity date of the loan.\n\n\u2022 Payment delays consist of modifications\nwhere we expect to collect contractual amounts\ndue but that result in a delay in the receipt\nof payments specified under the original loan\nterms. We generally consider payment delays to\nbe insignificant when the delay is three\nmonths or less.\n\n\u2022 Repayment plans are offered for some of our\ncredit card and unsecured line of credit\nproducts, which provide for a reduced payment\nand interest rate for a specific period of\ntime.\n\nAdditionally, modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir obligations to us, and those that enter\ninto trial modifications.\n\nFDMs exclude loans held for sale and loans\naccounted for under the fair value option. Our\ndisclosed FDM population also excludes\ngovernment insured or guaranteed education\nloans as loss mitigation activities for these\nloans are either required by law or they are\nconsidered separate from PNC\u2019s loss mitigation\ntreatments. Commercial loans with an appraised\nvalue of collateral that exceeds the loan\nvalue, loans with guarantor support, and\nresidential mortgage government insured or\nguaranteed loans are included in our disclosed\npopulation of FDMs when those loan\nmodifications are granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty.\n\nFDMs continue to be subject to our existing\nnonaccrual policies. Expected losses or\nrecoveries on FDMs have been factored into the\nALLL estimates for each loan class under the\nmethodologies described in this Note 1. Refer\nto Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for more information on FDMs.\n\nPrior to the adoption of this ASU, a TDR was\nconsidered a loan whose terms had been\nrestructured in a manner that granted a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. A concession had been\ngranted when we did not expect to collect all\namounts due, including original interest\naccrued at the original contract rate, as a\nresult of the restructuring, or there was a\ndelay in payment that was more-than-\ninsignificant. TDRs resulted from our loss\nmitigation activities, and included rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which were\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also resulted\nfrom borrowers that had been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and had not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us. In those\nsituations where principal is forgiven, the\namount of such principal forgiveness was\nimmediately charged off. Additionally, for\nperiods prior to 2023,\n\n94 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\npotential incremental losses or recoveries on\nTDRs had been factored into the ALLL estimates\nfor each loan class under the methodologies\ndescribed in this Note 1. Once a loan became a\nTDR, it would continue to be reported as a TDR\nuntil it was ultimately repaid in full, the\ncollateral was foreclosed upon or it fully\ncharged off. PNC excluded loans held for sale,\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption, and certain government insured or\nguaranteed loans from our TDR population.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and\nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL\nand additional details on the composition

                   \nCommercial\n\nWe generally charge off commercial (commercial\nand industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform. For commercial\nloans and leases less than a defined dollar\nthreshold, balances are generally charged off\nin full after 180 days for loans and 120 days\nfor leases.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 95\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell if the\nfair value is lower than the amortized cost\nbasis of the loan outstanding and the\ndelinquency of the loan, combined with other\nrisk factors such as bankruptcy or lien\nposition, indicates that the loan (or a\nportion thereof) is uncollectible as per our\nhistorical experience. These nonperforming\nloans would also be charged off when the\ncollateral has been repossessed. We charge off\nsecured consumer loans no later than 180 days\npast due. Most consumer loans and lines of\ncredit, not secured by automobiles or\nresidential real estate, are charged off once\nthey have reached 120-180 days past due.\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged off, resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected,\nlimited to amounts previously charged-off.\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, depending on\nwhether the accrued interest has been\nincorporated into the ACL estimates, as\ndiscussed in the Accrued Interest section of\nthis Note 1, the accrued and uncollected\ninterest is either reversed through Net\ninterest income (if a CECL reserve is not\nmaintained for accrued interest) or charged\noff against the allowance (if a CECL reserve\nis maintained for accrued interest), except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of a charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance. Payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both the\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as interest income. For certain\nconsumer loans, the receipt of interest\npayments is recognized as interest income on a\ncash basis. Cash basis income recognition is\napplied if a loan\u2019s amortized cost basis is\ndeemed fully collectible and the loan has\nperformed for at least six months.\n\nFor TDRs prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02,\npayments were applied based upon their\ncontractual terms unless the related loan was\ndeemed non-performing. TDRs were generally\nincluded in nonperforming and nonaccrual\nloans. However, after a reasonable period of\ntime, generally six months, in which the loan\nperformed under restructured terms and met\nother performance indicators, it was returned\nto performing/accruing status. TDRs resulting\nfrom (i) borrowers that had been discharged\nfrom personal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and had not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us, and (ii)\nborrowers that were not currently obligated to\nmake both principal and interest payments\nunder the restructured terms were not returned\nto accruing status.\n\nFor FDMs, payments are applied based upon\ntheir contractual terms unless the related\nloan is deemed nonperforming. Consumer loans\nmodified due to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty are generally included in\nnonperforming and nonaccrual loans if they are\nnot government insured or guaranteed.\nCommercial loans modified due to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty may be\nincluded in nonperforming and nonaccrual\nloans, subject to the bank\u2019s policies for\nnonperforming loans and leases. FDMs may\nremain on accruing status if the bank expects\nto collect all contractual principal and\ninterest due under the loan and the borrower\nremains current. Collateral coverage,\nguarantor and/or sponsor support and debt\nservice coverage are factors that may be\nconsidered in the accruing status of an FDM\nloan. FDM loans classified as nonperforming\nand nonaccrual loans may return to accruing\nstatus after a reasonable period of time,\ngenerally six months, in which the loan\nperforms under modified terms and meets other\nperformance indicators. This return to\naccruing status demonstrates that the bank\nexpects to collect all of the loan\u2019s remaining\ncontractual principal and interest. Loan\nmodifications granted to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty resulting\nfrom (i) borrowers that have been discharged\nfrom personal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us, and (ii)\nborrowers that are not currently obligated to\nmake both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms are not returned to\naccrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accruing status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the loan\u2019s\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collectability of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal may return to accruing status if the\nloan performs after a reasonable period of\ntime, generally six months, and the loan meets\nother performance indicators. When a\nnonperforming loan is returned to accruing\nstatus, it is then considered a performing\nloan. Nonaccrual loans with fully charged-off\nprincipal are prohibited from returning to\naccruing status.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\nresidential and commercial real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\n\n96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nthe acquisition date or estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on\nthese assets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information on\nFDMs, nonperforming assets and credit quality\nindicators related to our loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL is based on historical loss\nexperience, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, equipment finance leases,\nother financial assets and unfunded lending\nrelated commitments, for the remaining\nestimated contractual term of the assets or\nexposures as of the balance sheet date. The\nremaining contractual term of assets in scope\nof CECL is estimated considering contractual\nmaturity dates, prepayment expectations,\nutilization or draw expectations and any\ncontractually embedded extension options that\ndo not allow us to unilaterally cancel the\nextension options. For products without a\nfixed contractual maturity date ( e.g .,\ncredit cards), we rely on historical payment\nbehavior to determine the length of the\npaydown or default time period.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long-run\naverage expected losses, where applicable and\n(iii) the long-run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term. For\nall assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable.\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect potential trajectories of\nthe business cycles and their related\nestimated probabilities. The forecast length\nthat we have currently determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward-looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, analysis\nfrom PNC economists and management judgment.\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long-run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long-run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically one to three years, if not\nimmediate.\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long-run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio and,\ntherefore, do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\nSee the following sections related to\ninvestment securities, loans and leases,\nunfunded lending related commitments and other\nfinancial assets for details about specific\nreserve methodologies.\nAllowance for Investment Securities\nA significant portion of our investment\nsecurities are issued or guaranteed by either\nthe U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or a\ngovernment entity) or a government-sponsored\nagency (FNMA or FHLMC). Taking into\nconsideration historical information and\ncurrent and forecasted conditions, we do not\nexpect to incur any credit losses on these\nsecurities.\nInvestment securities that are not issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or a\ngovernment-sponsored agency consist of both\nsecuritized products, such as non-agency\nmortgage and asset-backed securities, as well\nas non-securitized products, such as corporate\nand municipal debt securities. A discounted\ncash flow approach is primarily used to\ndetermine the amount of the allowance\nrequired. The estimates of expected cash flows\nare determined using macroeconomic sensitive\nmodels taking into consideration the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period and\nscenarios discussed above. Additional factors\nunique to a specific security may also be\ntaken into consideration when estimating\nexpected cash flows. The cash flows expected\nto be collected, after considering expected\nprepayments, are discounted at the effective\ninterest rate. For an available-for-sale\nsecurity, the amount of the allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nestimated fair value.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 97\nSee Note 2 Investment Securities for\nadditional information about the investment\nsecurities portfolio.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is\nbased upon the quantification of risk\nparameters, such as PD, LGD, EAD and the\nremaining estimated contractual term for a\nloan, loan segment or lease. We also consider\nthe impact of prepayments and amortization on\nthe estimated contractual term in our expected\nloss estimates. We use historical credit loss\ninformation, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics and forecasted economic\nvariables for the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, coupled with analytical\nmethods, to estimate these risk parameters by\nloan, loan segment or lease. PD, LGD and EAD\nparameters are calculated for each forecasted\nscenario and the long-run average period, and\nare combined to generate expected loss\nestimates by scenario. Each scenario is then\nweighted to determine our total estimated\nloss. The following matrix provides key credit\nrisk characteristics that we use to estimate\nthese risk parameters.\n                                              \n  Loan       Probabi\u2026    Loss

\nAfter the forecast period, we revert to the\nlong-run average over the reversion period\nnoted above, which is the period between the\nend of the forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong-run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long-run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate. In addition, we add or deduct any\nqualitative components and other adjustments,\nsuch as individually assessed loans, to\nproduce the ALLL. See the Individually\nAssessed Component and Qualitative Component\ndiscussions that follow in this Note 1 for\nadditional information about those\nadjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes, in\naddition to our TDR portfolios. We determined\neffective interest rates considering\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for estimated\nprepayments. Changes in the ALLL due to the\nimpact of the passage of time under the\ndiscounted cash flow estimate were recognized\nthrough the provision for credit losses.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our\nuse of a discounted cash flow methodology, and\nwe now use a pooled expected loss methodology\nbased upon the quantification of risk\nparameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan\nor loan segment.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold\nare reserved for under a pooled basis, as we\nbelieve these loans continue to share similar\nrisk characteristics.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve models and methodologies\nstrive to reflect all relevant expected credit\nrisk factors, the ACL also accounts for\nfactors that may not be directly measured in\nthe determination of individually assessed or\npooled reserves. Such qualitative factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                  Form 10-K 99\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities and the Nonperforming\nLoans and Leases sections of this Note 1 for\nadditional information on our nonaccrual and\ncharge-off policies.\nPursuant to our use of a discounted cash flow\nmethodology in estimating credit losses for\nour home equity and residential real estate\nloan classes prior to January 1, 2023,\napplicable reserves for accrued interest were\nalso included within the ALLL for these loan\nclasses.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition, as the\nestimated expected credit loss of the\noutstanding balance or par value, based on the\nmethodologies described previously for loans\nand securities. In accordance with CECL, the\nallowance recognized at acquisition is added\nto the acquisition date purchase price to\ndetermine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable ( e.g. , unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\npooled loans and leases. See the Allowance for\nLoan and Lease Losses section of this Note 1\nfor the key credit risk characteristics for\nunfunded lending related commitments. The\nallowance for unfunded lending related\ncommitments is recorded as a liability on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to\nthis reserve are included in the Provision for\ncredit losses on the Consolidated Income\nStatement.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.\n\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets\n\nWe determine the allowance for other financial\nassets ( e.g. , trade receivables, servicing\nadvances on PNC-owned loans and balances with\nbanks) considering historical loss information\nand other available indicators. In certain\ncases where there are no historical, current\nor forecast indicators of an expected credit\nloss, we may estimate the reserve to be close\nto zero. As of December 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022 the allowance for other financial\nassets was immaterial.\nLoans Held for Sale\nWe designate loans as held for sale when we\nhave the intent and ability to sell them. At\nthe time of designation to held for sale, any\nACL is reversed, and a valuation allowance for\nthe shortfall between the amortized cost basis\nand the net realizable value is recognized,\nexcluding the amounts already charged off.\nSimilarly, when loans are no longer considered\nheld for sale, the valuation allowance (net of\nwritedowns) is reversed, and an allowance for\ncredit losses is established, excluding the\namounts already charged-off. Write-downs on\nloans held for sale (if required) are recorded\nas charge-offs through the valuation\nallowance. Adjustments to the valuation\nallowance on held for sale loans are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income.\nWe have elected to account for certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale at fair value. The changes in the\nfair value of commercial and residential\nmortgage loans are measured and recorded\nwithin Residential and Commercial mortgage\nwithin noninterest income each period. See\nNote 14 Fair Value for additional information.\n100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nInterest income with respect to loans held for\nsale is accrued based on the principal amount\noutstanding and the loan\u2019s contractual\ninterest rate.\n\nIn certain circumstances, loans designated as\nheld for sale may be transferred to held for\ninvestment based on a change in strategy. We\ntransfer these loans at the lower of cost or\nestimated fair value; however, any loans\noriginated or purchased for the held for sale\nportfolio and for which the fair value option\nhas been elected remain at fair value for the\nlife of the loan.\nLoan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained\nInterests\nWe recognize the sale of loans or other\nfinancial assets when the transferred assets\nare legally isolated from our creditors and\nthe appropriate accounting criteria are met.\nWe have sold mortgage and other loans through\nsecuritization transactions. In a\nsecuritization, financial assets are\ntransferred into trusts or to SPEs in\ntransactions to effectively legally isolate\nthe assets from us.\nIn a securitization, the trust or SPE issues\nbeneficial interests in the form of senior and\nsubordinated securities backed or\ncollateralized by the assets sold to the\ntrust. The senior classes of the asset-backed\nsecurities typically receive investment grade\ncredit ratings at the time of issuance. These\nratings are generally achieved through the\ncreation of lower-rated subordinated classes\nof asset-backed securities, as well as\nsubordinated or residual interests. In certain\ncases, we may retain a portion or all of the\nsecurities issued, interest-only strips, one\nor more subordinated tranches, servicing\nrights and, in some cases, cash reserve\naccounts. If sale accounting is achieved,\nsecuritized loans are removed from the balance\nsheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in\nNoninterest income at the time of initial\nsale. Gains or losses recognized on the sale\nof the loans depend on the fair value of the\nloans sold and the retained interests at the\ndate of sale. We generally estimate the fair\nvalue of the retained interests based on the\npresent value of future expected cash flows\nusing assumptions as to discount rates,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, credit\nlosses and servicing costs, if applicable.\nWith the exception of loan sales to certain\nU.S. government-chartered entities, our loan\nsales and securitizations are generally\nstructured without recourse to us except for\nrepresentations and warranties and with no\nrestrictions on the retained interests. We\noriginate, sell and service commercial\nmortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program.\nUnder the provisions of the DUS program, we\nparticipate in a loss-sharing arrangement with\nFNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing\nor recourse, our policy is to record such\nliabilities initially at fair value and\nsubsequently reserve for estimated losses in\naccordance with guidance contained in\napplicable GAAP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited\nliability company, or any other legal\nstructure used to conduct activities or hold\nassets generally that either:\n\u2022 Does not have equity investors with voting\nrights that can directly or indirectly make\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s most significant\neconomic activities through those voting\nrights or similar rights, or\n\u2022 Has equity investors that do not provide\nsufficient equity for the entity to finance\nits activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support.\nA VIE often holds financial assets, including\nloans or receivables, real estate or other\nproperty.\nVIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC\n810 \u2013 Consolidation when we hold a variable\ninterest in these entities. We consolidate a\nVIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The\nprimary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to\nbe the party that meets both of the following\ncriteria: (i) has the power to make decisions\nthat most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE; and (ii) has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Upon\nconsolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of\nthe VIE\u2019s assets, liabilities and\nnoncontrolling interests on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we\ndetermine whether any changes occurred\nrequiring a reassessment of whether we are the\nprimary beneficiary of an entity.\nSee Note 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities\nand Variable Interest Entities for information\nabout VIEs that we consolidate as well as\nthose that we do not consolidate but in which\nwe hold a significant variable interest.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe provide servicing under various loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential loans. These contracts are either\npurchased in the open market or retained as\npart of a loan securitization or loan sale.\nAll acquired or originated servicing rights\nare initially measured at fair value. Fair\nvalue is based on the present value of the\nexpected future net cash flows, including\nassumptions as to:\n\u2022 Deposit balances and interest rates for\nescrow and commercial reserve earnings,\n\u2022 Discount rates,\n\u2022 Estimated prepayment speeds, and\n\u2022 Estimated servicing costs.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 101\nWe\u2019ve elected to subsequently measure\ncommercial and residential MSRs at fair value.\nWe manage the risk of changes in fair value of\nMSRs by hedging the fair value with\nderivatives and securities which are expected\nto offset the change in fair value of the\nservicing rights. Changes in the fair value of\nMSRs are recognized as gains/(losses). The\nfair value of these servicing rights is\nestimated by using a discounted cash flow\nvaluation model which calculates the present\nvalue of estimated future net servicing cash\nflows, taking into consideration actual and\nexpected mortgage loan prepayment rates,\ndiscount rates, servicing costs and other\nfactors which are determined based on current\nmarket conditions.\n\nSee Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights and Note 14 Fair Value for additional\ninformation.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions\nrepresents the value attributable to\nunidentifiable intangible elements in the\nbusiness acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the\nreporting unit level on the acquisition date.\nA reporting unit is a business segment or\none level below a business segment. At least\nannually, in the fourth quarter, management\nperforms the goodwill impairment test at a\nreporting unit level. The goodwill impairment\ntest may also be performed more frequently if\nevents occur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date, when\nsuch events or circumstances may indicate that\nit is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is below its carrying\nvalue. Examples of events or circumstances\nthat are considered for more frequent goodwill\nimpairment testing include, but are not\nlimited to, changes in macroeconomic\nconditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, and other relevant PNC or\nreporting unit specific events.\nWhen performing a goodwill impairment test,\nPNC may first perform a qualitative analysis\nto evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. If, after\nconsidering all relevant events and\ncircumstances, PNC determines it is not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, then performing a quantitative\nimpairment test is not necessary. If PNC\nelects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or\nconcludes via qualitative analysis that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest is performed. Inputs are generated and\nused in calculating the fair value of the\nreporting unit, which is compared to its\ncarrying amount. The fair value of our\nreporting units is determined by using\ndiscounted cash flows and/or market\ncomparability methodologies. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying amount, an entity should recognize an\nimpairment charge for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of goodwill exceeds the\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value. The loss\nrecognized should not exceed the total amount\nof goodwill allocated to that reporting unit\nand subsequent reversals of goodwill\nimpairment are not permitted.\nSee Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\n\nLeases\nLessor Arrangements\nWe provide financing for various types of\nequipment, including aircraft, energy and\npower systems and vehicles through a variety\nof lease arrangements. Finance leases are\ncarried at the aggregate of lease payments\nplus estimated residual value of the leased\nequipment, less unearned income. Leveraged\nleases, a form of financing leases, are\ncarried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize\nincome over the term of the lease using the\nconstant effective yield method. Lease\nresidual values are reviewed for impairment at\nleast annually. Gains or losses on the sale of\nleased assets are included in Other\nnoninterest income. Valuation adjustments on\noperating lease residuals are included in\nOther noninterest expense while valuation\nadjustments on the net investment of a direct\nfinancing or sales-type lease are included in\nProvision for credit losses.\nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office\nspace, land and equipment under operating and\nfinance leases. Under ASC 842, we elected the\npractical expedient to account for the lease\nand nonlease components of real estate leases\nand leases of advertising assets, such as\nsignage, as a single lease component. For\nother leased asset classes, lease and nonlease\ncomponents of new lease agreements are\naccounted for separately. In addition, we\nelected the practical expedient to not apply\nthe recognition requirements under the\nstandard to short-term leases. Leases with an\ninitial term of 12 months or less are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize\nlease expense for these leases on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term. Generally, we\nhave elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap\nrate corresponding to the term of the lease at\nthe lease measurement date as our incremental\nborrowing rate to measure the right-of-use-\nasset and lease liability.\nSee Note 6 Leases for additional information\non our leasing arrangements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor financial reporting purposes, we\ndepreciate premises and equipment, net of\nsalvage value, principally using the straight-\nline method over their estimated useful lives.\n102 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nWe use estimated useful lives for furniture\nand equipment ranging from oneto 10years and\ndepreciate buildings over an estimated useful\nlife of up to 40years. We amortize leasehold\nimprovements over their estimated useful lives\nof up to 15years or the respective lease\nterms, whichever is shorter.\n\nWe purchase, as well as internally develop and\ncustomize, certain software to enhance or\nperform internal business functions. Software\ndevelopment costs incurred in the planning and\npost-development project stages are charged to\nNoninterest expense. Costs associated with\ndesigning software configuration and\ninterfaces, installation, coding programs and\ntesting systems are capitalized and amortized\nusing the straight-line method over periods\ngenerally ranging from oneto 10years.\nImplementation costs of software hosting\narrangements are capitalized and amortized\nover the contractual term of the associated\narrangement, including extension options we\nare reasonably certain to exercise, on a\nstraight-line basis.\n\nWe review the remaining useful lives and\ncarrying values of premises and equipment to\ndetermine whether an event has occurred that\nwould indicate a change in useful life is\nwarranted or if any impairment exists.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income, on an after-tax\nbasis, primarily consists of unrealized gains\nor losses on available for sale debt\nsecurities, unrealized gains or losses on\nderivatives designated as cash flow hedges,\nand changes in plan assets and benefit\nobligations of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans. Details of each\ncomponent are included in Note 12 Other\nComprehensive Income.\nTreasury Stock\nWe record common stock purchased for treasury\nat cost. At the date of subsequent reissue,\nthe treasury stock account is reduced by the\ncost of such stock on the first-in, first-out\nbasis.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated\nusing the two-class method to determine income\nattributable to common shareholders. Unvested\nshare-based payment awards that contain\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents are considered participating\nsecurities under the two-class method.\nDistributed dividends and dividend equivalents\nrelated to participating securities and an\nallocation of undistributed net income to\nparticipating securities reduce the amount of\nincome attributable to common shareholders. In\na period with a loss, no allocation will be\nmade to the participating securities, as they\ndo not have a contractual obligation to absorb\nlosses. Income attributable to common\nshareholders is then divided by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding for the\nperiod.\nDiluted earnings per common share is\ncalculated under the more dilutive of either\nthe treasury stock method or the two-class\nmethod. For the diluted calculation, we\nincrease the weighted-average number of shares\nof common stock outstanding by the assumed\nconversion of outstanding convertible\npreferred stock from the beginning of the year\nor date of issuance, if later, and the number\nof shares of common stock that would be issued\nassuming the exercise of stock options and\nwarrants and the issuance of incentive shares\nusing the treasury stock method. These\nadjustments to the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding are made\nonly when such adjustments will dilute\nearnings per common share. For periods in\nwhich there is a loss from continuing\noperations, any potential dilutive shares will\nbe anti-dilutive. In this scenario, no\npotential dilutive shares will be included in\nthe continuing operations, discontinued\noperations or total earnings per common share\ncalculations, even if overall net income is\nreported.\nSee Note 13 Earnings Per Share for additional\ninformation.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments and\nthe methods and assumptions used in estimating\nfair value amounts and financial assets and\nliabilities for which fair value was elected\nare detailed in Note 14 Fair Value.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to\nboth mitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risks inherent in\nour business activities, as well as to\nfacilitate customer risk management\nactivities. We manage these risks as part of\nour asset and liability management process and\nthrough credit policies and procedures.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments at\nfair value as either Other assets or Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nand the related cash flows in the Operating\nActivities section of the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for\ncounterparty credit risk are included in the\ndetermination of fair value. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative\ninstrument depends on whether it has been\ndesignated and qualifies as part of a cash\nflow or net investment hedging relationship.\nFor all other derivatives, changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in earnings.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 103\nWe utilize a net presentation for derivative\ninstruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ntaking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash collateral exchanged with counterparties\nis also netted against the applicable\nderivative exposures by offsetting obligations\nto return, or general rights to reclaim, cash\ncollateral against the fair values of the net\nderivatives being collateralized.\n\nFor those derivative instruments that are\ndesignated and qualify as accounting hedges,\nwe designate the hedging instrument, based on\nthe exposure being hedged, as a fair value\nhedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net\ninvestment in a foreign operation.\n\nWe formally document the relationship between\nthe hedging instruments and hedged items, as\nwell as the risk management objective and\nstrategy, before undertaking an accounting\nhedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the\nderivatives and related hedged items must be\ndesignated as a hedge at inception of the\nhedge relationship. In addition, a derivative\nmust be highly effective at reducing the risk\nassociated with the exposure being hedged. For\naccounting hedge relationships, we formally\nassess, both at the inception of the hedge and\non an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are\nhighly effective in offsetting designated\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item. If it is determined that the\nderivative instrument is not highly effective,\nhedge accounting is discontinued. We assess\neffectiveness using statistical regression\nanalysis. Where the critical terms of the\nderivative and hedged item match,\neffectiveness may be assessed qualitatively.\n\nFor derivatives that are designated as fair\nvalue hedges ( i.e ., hedging the exposure to\nchanges in the fair value of an asset or a\nliability attributable to a particular risk,\nsuch as changes in benchmark interest rates),\nchanges in the fair value of the hedging\ninstrument are recognized in earnings and\noffset by also recognizing in earnings the\nchanges in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk. To the extent\nthe change in fair value of the derivative\ndoes not offset the change in fair value of\nthe hedged item, the difference is reflected\nin the Consolidated Income Statement in the\nsame income statement line as the hedged item.\n\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges\n( i.e ., hedging the exposure to variability\nin expected future cash flows), the gain or\nloss on derivatives is reported as a component\nof AOCI and subsequently reclassified to\nincome in the same period or periods during\nwhich the hedged cash flows affect earnings\nand recorded in the same income statement line\nitem as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives\ndesignated as a hedge of net investment in a\nforeign operation, the gain or loss on the\nderivatives is reported as a component of\nAOCI.\n\nWe discontinue hedge accounting when it is\ndetermined that the derivative no longer\nqualifies as an effective hedge; the\nderivative expires or is sold, terminated or\nexercised; or the derivative is de-designated\nas a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a\ncash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that\nthe forecasted transaction will occur by the\nend of the originally specified time period.\n\nWe purchase or originate financial instruments\nthat contain an embedded derivative. For\nfinancial instruments not measured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings, we assess, at inception of the\ntransaction, if the economic characteristics\nof the embedded derivative are clearly and\nclosely related to the economic\ncharacteristics of the host contract, and\nwhether a separate instrument with the same\nterms as the embedded derivative would be a\nderivative. If the embedded derivative is not\nclearly and closely related to the host\ncontract and meets the definition of a\nderivative, the embedded derivative is\nrecorded separately from the host contract\nwith changes in fair value recorded in\nearnings, unless we elect to account for the\nhybrid instrument at fair value.\n\nWe enter into commitments to originate\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans for\nsale. We also enter into commitments to\npurchase or sell commercial and residential\nreal estate loans. These commitments are\naccounted for as free-standing derivatives\nwhich are recorded at fair value in Other\nassets or Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss\nfrom the change in fair value after the\ninception of the commitment is recognized in\nNoninterest income.\n\nSee Note 15 Financial Derivatives for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset\nand liability method. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities and\nare measured using the enacted tax rates and\nlaws that we expect will apply at the time\nwhen we believe the differences will reverse.\nChanges in tax rates and tax law are accounted\nfor in the period of enactment. Thus, at the\nenactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured\nand the change is recognized in Income tax\nexpense. The recognition of deferred tax\nassets requires an assessment to determine the\nrealization of such assets. Realization refers\nto the incremental benefit achieved through\nthe reduction in future taxes payable or\nrefunds receivable from the deferred tax\nassets, assuming that the underlying\ndeductible differences and carryforwards are\nthe last items to enter into the determination\nof future taxable income. We establish a\nvaluation allowance for tax assets when it is\nmore likely than not that they will not be\nrealized, based upon all available positive\nand negative evidence.\nWe have elected to apply the proportional\namortization method to our qualifying LIHTC\nand NMTC equity investments. Investment tax\ncredits and investment impairment are\nrecognized in tax expense for any individual\nLIHTC and NMTC equity investment for which we\ncan demonstrate that the investment was made\nprimarily for the purpose of receiving income\ntax credits and other income\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\ntax benefits. We use the deferral method of\naccounting for all investment tax credit\nequity investments. Under this method, the\ninvestment tax credits are recognized as a\nreduction to the related asset.\n\nSee Note 18 Income Taxes for additional\ninformation.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe earn interest and noninterest income from\nvarious sources, including:\n\n\u2022 Lending,\n\n\u2022 Securities portfolio,\n\n\u2022 Asset management,\n\n\u2022 Loan sales, loan securitizations and\nservicing,\n\n\u2022 Brokerage services,\n\n\u2022 Sale of loans and securities,\n\n\u2022 Certain private equity activities, and\n\n\u2022 Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange\nactivities.\n\nIn addition, we earn fees and commissions\nfrom:\n\n\u2022 Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of\ncredit and financial guarantees,\n\n\u2022 Deposit account services,\n\n\u2022 Merchant services,\n\n\u2022 Selling various insurance products,\n\n\u2022 Providing treasury management services\nincluding money transfer services,\n\n\u2022 Providing merger and acquisition advisory\nand related services,\n\n\u2022 Debit and credit card transactions, and\n\n\u2022 Facilitating and participating in certain\ncapital markets transactions.\n\nService charges on deposit accounts are\nrecognized when earned. Brokerage fees and\ngains and losses on the sale of securities and\ncertain derivatives are recognized on a trade-\ndate basis.\n\nWe record private equity income or loss based\non changes in the valuation of the underlying\ninvestments or when we dispose of our\ninterest.\n\nWe recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the\nfair value of certain financial instruments\nwhere we have elected the fair value option.\nThese financial instruments include certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans\noriginated for sale, certain residential\nmortgage portfolio loans and resale\nagreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on\nchanges in the fair value of residential and\ncommercial MSRs.\n\nWe recognize revenue from servicing\nresidential and commercial mortgages for\nothers as earned based on the specific\ncontractual terms. These revenues are reported\non the Consolidated Income Statement in the\nline item Residential and commercial mortgage.\nWe recognize revenue from securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange customer-\nrelated trading, as well as securities\nunderwriting activities, as these transactions\noccur or as services are provided. We\ngenerally recognize gains from the sale of\nloans upon meeting the derecognition criteria\nfor transfers of financial assets. Mortgage\nrevenue recognized is reported net of mortgage\nrepurchase reserves.\n\nFor the fee-based revenue within the scope of\nASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers , revenue is recognized when or as\nthose services are transferred to the\ncustomer.

The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $\n282million and $ 144million, respectively.\nThese amounts are included in Other assetson\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 86million for securities\navailable for sale, primarily related to non-\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities\nand $ 6million for securities held to maturity\nat December 31, 2023. The comparable amounts\nat December 31, 2022 were $ 142million and $\n7million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held to maturity securities transferred\nfrom available for sale are included in held\nto maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 4.2billion at December 31, 2023,\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax. The comparable\namount at December 31, 2022 was $ 5.1billion.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at December\n31, 2023 included less than $ 0.1billion of\nnet unsettled purchases that represent non-\ncash investing activity, and accordingly, are\nnot reflected on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. The comparable amount for December\n31, 2022 was $ 0.2billion.\n\nDuring 2022, we transferred securities with a\nfair value of $ 82.7billion from available for\nsale to held to maturity. The securities\ntransferred included $ 34.0billion of U.S.\nTreasury and government agency securities, $\n39.0billion of agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, $ 6.3billion of asset-\nbacked securities and $ 3.4billion of various\nother security types. The securities were\nreclassified at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer and the transfers represented non-\ncash transactions. There were no securities\ntransferred during 2023.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb\n\nexpected credit losses on our portfolio. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the allowance for\ninvestment securities was $ 92million and\n\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2022 was $ 149million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\n108 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nAt December 31, 2023, AOCI included pretax\nlosses of $ 293million from derivatives that\nhedged the purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 36 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at December 31, 2023\nand 2022. These securities are segregated\nbetween investments that had been in a\ncontinuous unrealized loss position for less\nthan twelve months and twelve months or more,\nbased on the point in time that the fair value\ndeclined below the amortized cost basis. All\nsecurities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, we concluded that we do not\nintend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 36: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

These products are standard in the\nfinancial services industry and product\nfeatures are considered during the\nunderwriting process to mitigate the increased\nrisk that the interest-only feature may result\nin borrowers not\n\nbeing able to make interest and principal\npayments when due. We do not believe that\nthese product features create a concentration\nof\n\ncredit risk.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we pledged $ 51.3billion\nof commercial and other loans to the Federal\nReserve Bank and $ 89.5billion of residential\nreal estate and other loans to the FHLB as\ncollateral for the ability to borrow, if\nnecessary. The comparable amounts at December\n31, 2022 were $ 28.1billion and $ 90.4billion,\nrespectively. Amounts pledged reflect the\nunpaid principal balances.\n\nNonperforming Assets\n\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming\nloans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets.\nNonperforming loans are those loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost whose credit quality has\ndeteriorated to the extent that full\ncollection of contractual principal and\ninterest is not probable. Interest income is\nnot recognized on these loans. Loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option are reported\nas performing loans; however, when nonaccrual\ncriteria is met, interest income is not\nrecognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.

The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2022 was $ 0.7billion.\nAdditional Credit Quality Indicators by Loan\nClass\n\nCommercial and Industrial\n\nFor commercial and industrial loans, we\nmonitor the performance of the borrower in a\ndisciplined and regular manner based upon the\nlevel of credit risk inherent in the loan. To\nevaluate the level of credit risk, we assign\nan internal risk rating reflecting the\nborrower\u2019s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional\ncredit risk rating methodology provides\ngranularity in the risk monitoring process.\nThese ratings are generally reviewed and\nupdated at least once per year. For small\nbalance homogeneous pools of commercial and\nindustrial loans and leases, we apply scoring\ntechniques to assist in determining the PD.\nThe combination of the PD and LGD ratings\nassigned to commercial and industrial loans,\ncapturing both the combination of expectations\nof default and loss severity in the event of\ndefault, reflects credit quality\ncharacteristics as of the reporting date and\nare used as inputs into our loss forecasting\nprocess.\n\nBased upon the amount of the lending\narrangement and our risk rating assessment, we\nfollow a formal schedule of written periodic\nreviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews\nof a market\u2019s or business unit\u2019s loan\nportfolio, focusing on those loans which we\nperceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs\nand LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is\nweakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our\npractice to review any customer obligation and\nits level of credit risk more frequently. We\nattempt to proactively manage our loans by\nusing various procedures that are customized\nto the risk of a given loan, including ongoing\noutreach, contact, and assessment of obligor\nfinancial conditions, collateral inspection\nand appraisal.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 113\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate projects and commercial\nmortgages similar to commercial and industrial\nloans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks\nassociated with commercial real estate\nprojects and commercial mortgage activities\ntend to be correlated to the loan structure\nand collateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. As a result, these\nattributes are also monitored and utilized in\nassessing credit risk.\n\nAs with the commercial and industrial loan\nclass, a formal schedule of periodic reviews\nis also performed to assess market/geographic\nrisk and business unit/industry risk. Often as\na result of these reviews, more in-depth\nreviews and increased scrutiny are placed on\nareas of higher risk, such as adverse changes\nin risk ratings, deteriorating operating\ntrends, and/or areas that concern management.\nThese reviews are designed to assess risk and\nfacilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\n\nEquipment Lease Financing\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\nequipment lease financing loan class similar\nto commercial and industrial loans by\nanalyzing PD and LGD.\n\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and\nthe level of credit risk, we follow a formal\nschedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this\noccurs quarterly, although we have established\npractices to review such credit risk more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant. Our\nreview process entails analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual\nvalue, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk,\nindustry risk, guarantor requirements and\nregulatory compliance as applicable.\n\n114 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for our commercial loan classes:\n\nTable 42: Commercial Credit Quality Indicators\n(a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Loans in our commercial portfolio are\nclassified as Pass Rated or Criticized based\non the regulatory definitions, which are\ndriven by the PD and LGD ratings that we\nassign.

A summary of credit quality\nindicators follows:\n\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor\ntrending of delinquency/delinquency rates for\nresidential real estate and home equity loans.\nSee Table 40 for additional information.\n\nNonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of\nnonperforming loans for residential real\nestate and home equity loans. See Table 40 for\nadditional information.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 115\nCredit Scores: We use a national third-party\nprovider to update FICO credit scores for\nresidential real estate and home equity loans\nat least quarterly. The updated scores are\nincorporated into a series of credit\nmanagement reports, which are utilized to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and\nsubordinate lien positions): At least\nquarterly, we update the property values of\nreal estate collateral and calculate an\nupdated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines\nsecured by real estate in regions experiencing\nsignificant declines in property values, more\nfrequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV\nmigration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nWe use a combination of original LTV and\nupdated LTV for internal risk management and\nreporting purposes ( e.g. , line management,\nloss mitigation strategies). In addition to\nthe fact that estimated property values by\ntheir nature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that\nupdated LTVs may be based upon management\u2019s\nassumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider,\nHPI changes will be incorporated in arriving\nat management\u2019s estimate of updated LTV).\n\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled\nproperty values. The related estimates and\ninputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation\nmodels, broker price opinions, HPI indices,\nproperty location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and\nmanagement assumptions. We generally utilize\norigination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include\nan amortization assumption when calculating\nupdated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the\ncalculations do not represent actual appraised\nloan level collateral or updated LTV based\nupon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to\nchange as we refine our methodology.\n\n116 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for our residential real estate and\nhome equity loan classes:\n\nTable 43: Credit Quality Indicators for\nResidential Real Estate and Home Equity Loan\nClasses\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 117\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Gross charge-offs are presented on a year-\nto-date basis, as of the reporting date.\n\nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer\n\nWe monitor a variety of credit quality\ninformation in the management of these\nconsumer loan classes. For all loan types, we\ngenerally use a combination of internal loan\nparameters as well as an updated FICO score.\nWe use FICO scores as a primary credit quality\nindicator for automobile and credit card\nloans, as well as non-government guaranteed or\nnon-insured education loans and other secured\nand unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit\nmetrics, such as delinquency status, are\nheavily relied upon as credit quality\nindicators for government guaranteed or\ninsured education loans and consumer loans to\nhigh net worth individuals, as internal credit\nmetrics are more relevant than FICO scores for\nthese types of loans.\n\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency\ntrends and losses for each class, FICO credit\nscore updates are obtained at least quarterly\nalong with a variety of credit bureau\nattributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend\nto have a lower likelihood of loss.\nConversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to\nhave a higher likelihood of loss.\n\n118 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The slight increase in reserves was\nprimarily driven by portfolio activity,\nincluding changes in credit quality related to\nthe commercial real estate portfolio,\npartially offset by an updated economic\noutlook.\n\nN OTE 4 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nWe have transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement. These transfers have occurred\nthrough Agency securitization, Non-agency\nsecuritization, and loan sale transactions.\nAgency securitizations consist of\nsecuritization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC\nand GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA\nand FHLMC generally securitize our transferred\nloans into mortgage-backed securities for sale\ninto the secondary market through SPEs that\nthey sponsor. As an authorized GNMA\nissuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of\nVA insured loans into mortgage-backed\nsecurities for sale into the secondary market.\nIn Non-agency securitizations, we have\ntransferred loans into securitization SPEs. In\nother instances, third-party investors have\nalso purchased our loans in loan sale\ntransactions and in certain instances have\nsubsequently sold these loans into\nsecuritization SPEs. Securitization SPEs\nutilized in the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization transactions are VIEs.\n\nOur continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC,\nand GNMA securitizations, Non-agency\nsecuritizations, and loan sale transactions\ngenerally consists of servicing, repurchasing\npreviously transferred loans or loss share\narrangements under certain conditions, and, in\nlimited circumstances, holding of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the securitization\nSPEs.\n\nDepending on the transaction, we may act as\nthe master, primary and/or special servicer to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors. Servicing responsibilities\ntypically consist of collecting and remitting\nmonthly borrower principal and interest\npayments, maintaining escrow deposits,\nperforming loss mitigation and foreclosure\nactivities, and, in certain instances, funding\nof servicing advances. Servicing advances,\nwhich are generally reimbursable, are made for\nprincipal and interest and collateral\nprotection and are carried in Other assets at\ncost.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 5 Goodwill and\nMortgage Servicing Rights and Note 14 Fair\nValue for further discussion of our servicing\nrights.\n\nCertain loans transferred to the Agencies\ncontain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an\noption to repurchase at par individual\ndelinquent loans that meet certain criteria.\nIn other limited cases, GNMA has granted us\nthe right to repurchase current loans when we\nintend to modify the borrower\u2019s interest rate\nunder established guidelines. When we have the\nunilateral ability to repurchase a loan,\neffective control over the loan has been\nregained and we recognize an asset (in either\nLoans or Loans held for sale) and a\ncorresponding liability (in Other borrowed\nfunds) on the balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan.\n\nThe Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the securitization SPEs\nthat are purchased and held on our balance\nsheet are typically purchased in the secondary\nmarket. We do not retain any credit risk on\nour Agency mortgage-backed security positions\nas FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for\nGNMA) guarantee losses of principal and\ninterest.\n\nWe also have involvement with certain Agency\nand Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs\nwhere we have not transferred commercial\nmortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by\nindependent third-parties and the loans held\nby these entities were purchased exclusively\nfrom other third-parties. Generally, our\ninvolvement with these SPEs is as servicer\nwith servicing activities consistent with\nthose described above.\n\nWe recognize a liability for our loss exposure\nassociated with contractual obligations to\nrepurchase previously transferred loans due to\npossible breaches of representations and\nwarranties and also for loss sharing\narrangements (recourse obligations) with the\nAgencies. Other than providing temporary\nliquidity under servicing advances and our\nloss exposure associated with our repurchase\nand recourse obligations, we have not provided\nnor are we required to provide any type of\ncredit support, guarantees or commitments to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors in these transactions.\n\n124 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\nThe following table provides our loan sale and\nservicing activities:\nTable 51: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities\n                                              \n  In                                          \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Cash                                        \n  Flo\u2026                                        \n  -

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 53\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE.

In performing these\nassessments, we evaluate our level of\ncontinuing involvement in these transactions\nas the nature of our involvement ultimately\ndetermines whether or not we hold a variable\ninterest and/or are the primary beneficiary of\nthe SPE. Factors we consider in our\nconsolidation assessment include the\nsignificance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii)\nour holdings of mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the\nrights of third-party variable interest\nholders.\n\nThe first step in our assessment is to\ndetermine whether we hold a variable interest\nin the securitization SPE. We hold variable\ninterests in Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs through our holding of\nresidential and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the SPEs and/or our\nrecourse obligations. Each SPE in which we\nhold a variable interest is evaluated to\ndetermine whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of the entity. For Agency\nsecuritization transactions, our contractual\nrole as servicer does not give us the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly\naffect the economic performance of the SPEs.\nThus, we are not the primary beneficiary of\nthese entities. For Non-agency securitization\ntransactions, we would be the primary\nbeneficiary to the extent our servicing\nactivities give us the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the SPE and we hold a\nmore-than-insignificant variable interest in\nthe entity.\n\nDetails about the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs where we hold a variable\ninterest and are not the primary beneficiary\nare included in Table 53. Our maximum exposure\nto loss as a result of our involvement with\nthese SPEs is the carrying value of the\nmortgage-backed securities, servicing assets,\nservicing advances and our liabilities\nassociated with our recourse obligations.\nCreditors of the securitization SPEs have no\nrecourse to our assets or general credit.\n\nTax Credit Investments and Other\n\nFor tax credit investments in which we do not\nhave the right to make decisions that will\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the entity, we are not the\nprimary beneficiary and thus do not\nconsolidate the entity. These investments are\ndisclosed in Table 53. The table also reflects\nour maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any\npotential tax credit recapture. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is equal to our legally\nbinding equity commitments adjusted for\nrecorded impairment, partnership results or\namortization for qualifying LIHTC investments\nwhen applicable. For all legally binding\nunfunded equity commitments, we increase our\nrecognized investment and recognize a\nliability. As of December 31, 2023, we had a\nliability for unfunded commitments of $\n2.1billion related to investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects which is reflected\nin Other liabilities on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n\nTable 53 also includes our involvement in\nlease financing transactions with LLCs engaged\nin solar power generation that, to a large\nextent, provided returns in the form of tax\ncredits. The outstanding financings and\noperating lease assets are reflected as Loans\nand Other assets, respectively, on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, whereas related\nliabilities are reported in Deposits and Other\nliabilities.\n\n126 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nWe also make certain equity investments in\nvarious tax credit limited partnerships or\nLLCs. The purpose of these investments is to\nachieve a satisfactory return on capital and\nto assist us in achieving goals associated\nwith the CRA. During 2023, we recognized $\n0.4billion of amortization, $ 0.4billion of\ntax credits and less than $ 0.1billion of\nother tax benefits associated with qualified\ninvestments in LIHTCs and NMTCs within Income\ntaxes. We recognized $ 0.4billion of\namortization, $ 0.4billion of tax credits and\nless than $ 0.1billion of other tax benefits\nassociated with qualified investments in\nLIHTCs within Income taxes in 2022.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\n128 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 57 and 58. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions:\nTable 57: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key Valuation

Approximately 97% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass at December 31, 2023, with the\nremainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them. The standby\nletters of credit outstanding on December 31,\n2023 had terms ranging from less than one\nyearto seven years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, assets of $\n1.2billion secured certain specifically\nidentified standby letters of credit. In\naddition, a portion of the remaining standby\nletters of credit issued on behalf of specific\ncustomers is also secured by collateral or\nguarantees that secure the customers\u2019 other\nobligations to us. The carrying amount of the\nliability for our obligations related to\nstandby letters of credit and participations\nin standby letters of credit was $ 0.2billion\nat December 31, 2023 and is included

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. The three\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\n\u2022 Level 1: Fair value is determined using a\nquoted price in an active market for identical\nassets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and\nliabilities may include debt securities,\nequity securities and listed derivative\ncontracts that are traded in an active\nexchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that are actively traded in over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\n\u2022 Level 2: Fair value is estimated using\ninputs other than quoted prices included\nwithin Level 1 that are observable for assets\nor liabilities, either directly or indirectly.\nThe majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities\ninclude debt securities and listed derivative\ncontracts with quoted prices that are traded\nin markets that are not active, and certain\ndebt and equity securities and over-the-\ncounter derivative contracts whose fair value\nis determined using a pricing model without\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\n\u2022 Level 3: Fair value is estimated using\nunobservable inputs that are significant to\nthe fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities include\nfinancial instruments whose value is\ndetermined using pricing models and discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or similar techniques\nfor which the significant valuation inputs are\nnot observable and the determination of fair\nvalue requires significant management judgment\nor estimation.\n\nWe characterize active markets as those where\ntransaction volumes are sufficient to provide\nobjective pricing information, with reasonably\nnarrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer\nquotes received do not vary widely and are\nbased on current information. Inactive markets\nare typically characterized by low transaction\nvolumes, price quotations that vary\nsubstantially among market participants or are\nnot based on current information, wide bid/ask\nspreads, a significant increase in implied\nliquidity risk premiums, yields, or\nperformance indicators for observed\ntransactions or quoted prices compared to\nhistorical periods, a significant decline or\nabsence of a market for new issuance, or any\ncombination of the above factors. We also\nconsider nonperformance risks, including\ncredit risk, as part of our valuation\nmethodology for all assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value,\nby their nature, result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Assets and\nliabilities classified within Level 3\ninherently require the use of various\nassumptions, estimates and judgments when\nmeasuring their fair value. As observable\nmarket activity is commonly not available to\nuse when estimating the fair value of Level 3\nassets and liabilities, we must estimate fair\nvalue using various modeling techniques. These\ntechniques include the use of a variety of\ninputs/assumptions including credit quality,\nliquidity, interest rates or other relevant\ninputs across the entire population of our\nLevel 3 assets\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 139\nand liabilities. Changes in the significant\nunderlying factors or assumptions (either an\nincrease or a decrease) in any of these areas\nunderlying our estimates may have resulted in\na significant increase/decrease in the Level 3\nfair value measurement of a particular asset\nand/or liability from period to period.\n\nAny models used to determine fair values or to\nvalidate dealer quotes are subject to review\nand independent testing as part of our model\nvalidation and internal control testing\nprocesses. Our Model Risk Management Group\nreviews significant models on at least an\nannual basis. In addition, the Valuation\nCommittee approves valuation methodologies and\nreviews the results of independent valuation\nreviews and processes for assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain residential mortgage\nloans originated for sale at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. The election of the fair\nvalue option aligns the accounting for the\nresidential mortgages with the related hedges.\nResidential mortgage loans are valued based on\nquoted market prices, where available, prices\nfor other traded mortgage loans with similar\ncharacteristics, and purchase commitments and\nbid information received from market\nparticipants. The prices are adjusted as\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain loans that are priced based on the\npricing of similar loans. These adjustments\nrepresent unobservable inputs to the valuation\nbut are not considered significant given the\nrelative insensitivity of the value to changes\nin these inputs to the fair value of the\nloans. Accordingly, the majority of\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale are\nclassified as Level 2.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage\nloans classified as held for sale in whole\nloan transactions at fair value. We determine\nthe fair value of commercial mortgage loans\nheld for sale based upon discounted cash\nflows. Fair value is determined using sale\nvaluation assumptions that management believes\na market participant would use in pricing the\nloans.\n\nFor loans to be sold to agencies with\nservicing retained, the fair value is adjusted\nfor the estimated servicing cash flows, which\nis an unobservable input. This adjustment is\nnot considered significant given the relative\ninsensitivity of the value to changes in the\ninput to the fair value of the loans.\nAccordingly, commercial mortgage loans held\nfor sale to agencies are classified as Level\n2.\n\nValuation assumptions may include observable\ninputs based on the benchmark interest rate\nswap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales\ntransactions. The significant unobservable\ninput for commercial mortgage loans held for\nsale, excluding those to be sold to agencies,\nis management\u2019s assumption of the spread\napplied to the benchmark rate. The spread over\nthe benchmark curve includes management\u2019s\nassumptions of the impact of credit and\nliquidity risk. Significant increases\n(decreases) in the spread applied to the\nbenchmark would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower (higher) asset value. The\nwide range of the spread over the benchmark\ncurve is due to the varying risk and\nunderlying property characteristics within our\nportfolio. Based on the significance of the\nunobservable input, we classified this\nportfolio as Level 3.\n\nSecurities Available for Sale and Trading\nSecurities\n\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available for sale and trading\nportfolios. We primarily use prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes or recent\ntrades to determine the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of securities were\npriced by third-party vendors. The third-party\nvendors use a variety of methods when pricing\nsecurities that incorporate relevant market\ndata to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer\nin the marketplace would pay for a security\nunder current market conditions. We monitor\nand validate the reliability of vendor pricing\non an ongoing basis through pricing\nmethodology reviews, including detailed\nreviews of the assumptions and inputs used by\nthe vendor to price individual securities, and\nthrough price validation testing. Securities\nnot priced by one of our pricing vendors may\nbe valued using a dealer quote, which are also\nsubject to price validation testing. Price\nvalidation testing is performed independent of\nthe risk-taking function and involves\ncorroborating the prices received from third-\nparty vendors and dealers with prices from\nanother third party or through other sources,\nsuch as internal valuations or sales of\nsimilar securities. Security prices are also\nvalidated through actual cash settlement upon\nsale of a security.\n\nSecurities are classified within the fair\nvalue hierarchy after considering the activity\nlevel in the market for the security type and\nthe observability of the inputs used to\ndetermine the fair value. When a quoted price\nin an active market exists for the identical\nsecurity, this price is used to determine fair\nvalue and the security is classified within\nLevel 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities\ninclude U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nWhen a quoted price in an active market for\nthe identical security is not available, fair\nvalue is estimated using either an alternative\nmarket approach, such as a recent trade or\nmatrix pricing, or an income approach, such as\na discounted cash flow pricing model. If the\ninputs to the valuation are based primarily on\nmarket observable information, then the\nsecurity is classified within Level 2 of the\nhierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency\ndebt securities, agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, agency and non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, certain\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities, asset-backed securities\n\n140 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\ncollateralized by non-mortgage-related\ncorporate and consumer loans, and other debt\nsecurities. Level 2 securities are\npredominantly priced by third parties, either\nby a pricing vendor or dealer.\n\nIn certain cases where there is limited\nactivity or less transparency around the\ninputs to the valuation, securities are\nclassified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nSecurities classified as Level 3 consist\nprimarily of non-agency residential mortgage-\nbacked and asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by first- and second-lien\nresidential mortgage loans. Fair value for\nthese securities is primarily estimated using\npricing obtained from third-party vendors. In\nsome cases, fair value is estimated using a\ndealer quote, by reference to prices of\nsecurities of a similar vintage and collateral\ntype or by reference to recent sales of\nsimilar securities. Market activity for these\nsecurity types is limited with little price\ntransparency. As a result, these securities\nare generally valued by the third-party vendor\nusing a discounted cash flow approach that\nincorporates significant unobservable inputs\nand observable market activity where\navailable. Significant inputs to the valuation\ninclude prepayment projections and credit loss\nassumptions (default rate and loss severity)\nand discount rates that are deemed\nrepresentative of current market conditions.\nSignificant increases (decreases) in any of\nthose assumptions in isolation would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nCertain infrequently traded debt securities\nwithin other debt securities available for\nsale and trading securities are also\nclassified in Level 3 and are included in the\nInsignificant Level 3 assets, net of\nliabilities line item in Table 80. The\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to\nestimate the fair value of these securities\ninclude an estimate of expected credit losses\nand a discount for liquidity risk. These\ninputs are incorporated into the fair value\nmeasurement by either increasing the spread\nover the benchmark curve or by applying a\ncredit and liquidity discount to the par value\nof the security. Significant increases\n(decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk\ncould have resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value estimate.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans accounted for at fair value consist\nprimarily of residential mortgage loans. These\nloans are generally valued similarly to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale and\nare classified as Level 2. However, similar to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale, if\nthese loans are repurchased and unsalable,\nthey are classified as Level 3. In addition,\nrepurchased VA loans, where only a portion of\nthe principal will be reimbursed, are\nclassified as Level 3. The fair value is\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation based on our historical loss rate.\nWe have elected to account for certain home\nequity lines of credit at fair value. These\nloans are classified as Level 3. Significant\ninputs to the valuation of these loans include\ncredit and liquidity discount, cumulative\ndefault rate, loss severity and gross discount\nrate and are deemed representative of current\nmarket conditions. Significant increases\n(decreases) in any of these assumptions would\nhave resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments includes money market\nmutual funds as well as direct and indirect\nprivate equity investments. Money market\nmutual funds are valued based on quoted prices\nin active markets for identical securities and\nclassified within Level 1 of the hierarchy.\nThe valuation of direct and indirect private\nequity investments requires significant\nmanagement judgment due to the absence of\nquoted market prices, inherent lack of\nliquidity and the long-term nature of such\ninvestments. Various valuation techniques are\nused for direct investments, including\nmultiples of adjusted earnings of the entity,\nindependent appraisals, anticipated financing\nand sale transactions with third parties, or\nthe pricing used to value the entity in a\nrecent financing transaction. A multiple of\nadjusted earnings calculation is the valuation\ntechnique utilized most frequently and is the\nmost significant unobservable input used in\nsuch calculation. Significant decreases\n(increases) in the multiple of earnings could\nhave resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement. Generally,\ndirect equity investments are classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nIndirect investments are not redeemable;\nhowever, we receive distributions over the\nlife of the partnerships from liquidation of\nthe underlying investments by the investee,\nwhich we expect to occur over the next\n12years. We value indirect investments in\nprivate equity funds using the NAV practical\nexpedient as provided in the financial\nstatements that we receive from fund managers.\nDue to the time lag in our receipt of the\nfinancial information and based on a review of\ninvestments and valuation techniques applied,\nadjustments to the manager-provided value are\nmade when available recent portfolio company\ninformation or market information indicates a\nsignificant change in value from that provided\nby the manager of the fund. Indirect\ninvestments valued using NAV are not\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\n\nMSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs\nvaluation model reflect management\u2019s best\nestimate of factors that a market participant\nwould use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales\nof MSRs do occur and can offer some market\ninsight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open\nmarket with readily observable prices so the\nprecise terms and conditions of sales are not\navailable.\n\nResidential MSRs\n\nThe fair value of residential MSRs is\nestimated by using a discounted cash flow\nmodel incorporating unobservable inputs for\nassumptions such as constant prepayment rates,\nspread over the benchmark curve, and other\nfactors. Due to the nature of the unobservable\nvaluation inputs, residential MSRs are\nclassified as Level 3. The significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of residential MSRs are constant\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve. Significant increases\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 141\n(decreases) in prepayment rates and spread\nover the benchmark curve would have resulted\nin lower (higher) fair market value of\nresidential MSRs.\n\nAs a benchmark for the reasonableness of our\nresidential MSRs fair value, we obtained\nopinions of value from independent brokers.\nThese brokers provided a range (+/- 10bps)\nbased upon their own discounted cash flow\ncalculations of our portfolio that reflect\nconditions in the secondary market and any\nrecently executed servicing transactions. We\ncompare our internally-developed residential\nMSRs value to the ranges of values received\nfrom the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair\nvalue falls outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges,\nmanagement will assess whether a valuation\nadjustment is warranted. For the periods\npresented, our residential MSRs value did not\nfall outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges.\n\nCommercial MSRs\n\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated\nby using a discounted cash flow model\nincorporating unobservable inputs for\nassumptions such as constant prepayment rates,\ndiscount rates and other factors. Due to the\nnature of the unobservable valuation inputs\nand the limited availability of market\npricing, commercial MSRs are classified as\nLevel 3. Significant increases (decreases) in\nconstant prepayment rates and discount rates\nwould have resulted in significantly lower\n(higher) commercial MSR value determined based\non current market conditions and expectations.\n\nFinancial Derivatives\n\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued using\nquoted market prices and are classified as\nLevel 1. The majority of derivatives that we\nenter into are executed over-the-counter and\nare valued using internal models. These\nderivatives are primarily classified as Level\n2, as the readily observable market inputs to\nthese models are validated to external\nsources, such as industry pricing services, or\nare corroborated through recent trades, dealer\nquotes, yield curves, implied volatility or\nother market-related data. Level 2 financial\nderivatives are primarily estimated using\nobservable benchmark interest rate swaps to\nconstruct projected discounted cash flows.\n\nFinancial derivatives that are priced using\nsignificant management judgment or assumptions\nare classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs\nrelated to interest rate contracts include\nprobability of funding of residential mortgage\nloan commitments and estimated servicing cash\nflows of commercial and residential mortgage\nloan commitments. Probability of default and\nloss severity are the significant unobservable\ninputs used in the valuation of risk\nparticipation agreements. The fair values of\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities related to\nthese interest rate contract financial\nderivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nare included in the Insignificant Level 3\nassets, net of liabilities line item in Table\n80 of this Note 14.\n\nIn connection with the sales of portions of\nour Visa Class B common shares, we entered\ninto swap agreements with the purchasers of\nthose shares to retain any future risk of\ndecreases in the conversion rate of Class B\ncommon shares to Class A common shares\nresulting from increases in the escrow funded\nby Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of\nthe pending interchange litigation (see Note\n20 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also\nrequire PNC to make periodic payments based on\nthe market price of the Class A common shares\nat a fixed rate of interest (in certain cases\nsubject to step-up provisions) until the Visa\nlitigation is resolved. An increase in the\nestimated length of litigation resolution\ndate, a decrease in the estimated conversion\nrate or an increase in the estimated growth\nrate of the Class A share price would have had\na negative impact on the fair value of the\nswaps and vice versa.\n\nThe fair values of our derivatives include a\ncredit valuation adjustment to reflect our own\nand our counterparties\u2019 nonperformance risk.\nOur credit valuation adjustment is computed\nusing credit default swap spreads, in\nconjunction with internal historical recovery\nobservations.\n\nOther Assets and Liabilities\n\nOther assets held at fair value on a recurring\nbasis primarily include assets related to\nPNC\u2019s deferred compensation and supplemental\nincentive savings plans.\n\nThe assets related to PNC\u2019s deferred\ncompensation and supplemental incentive\nsavings plans primarily consist of a prepaid\nforward contract referencing an amount of\nshares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and\nfixed income funds, and are valued based on\nthe underlying investments. These assets are\nvalued either by reference to the market price\nof PNC\u2019s stock or by using the quoted market\nprices for investments other than PNC\u2019s stock\nand are included in Levels 1 and 2.\n\nAll Level 3 other assets and liabilities are\nincluded in the Insignificant Level 3 assets,\nnet of liabilities line item in Table 80 in\nthis Note 14.\n\nOther Borrowed Funds\n\nOther borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S.\nTreasury securities sold short which are\nclassified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds\nalso includes the related liability for\ncertain repurchased loans for which we have\nelected the fair value option and are\nclassified as either Level 2 or Level 3,\nconsistent with the level classification of\nthe corresponding loans. All Level 3 amounts\nare included in the Insignificant Level 3\nassets, net of liabilities line item in Table\n80 in this Note 14.\n\n142 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\nThe following table summarizes our assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, including instruments for\nwhich we have elected the fair value option:\nTable 78: Fair Value Measurements \u2013 Recurring\nBasis Summary\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Certain investments that are measured at\nfair value using the NAV per share (or its\nequivalent) practical expedient have not been\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(b) Included in Other assetson the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c) Amounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are\npresented gross and are not reduced by the\nimpact of legally enforceable master netting\nagreements that allow us to net positive and\nnegative positions and cash collateral held or\nplaced with the same counterparty.

The\nimpairment is primarily based on the appraised\nvalue of the collateral.\n\nAppraisals are obtained by licensed or\ncertified appraisers at least annually and\nmore recently in certain instances. All third-\nparty appraisals are reviewed and any\nadjustments to the initial appraisal are\nincorporated into the final issued appraisal\nreport. In instances where an appraisal is not\nobtained, collateral value is determined\nconsistent with external third-party appraisal\nstandards by an internal person independent of\nthe asset manager.\n                                              \n  Equity Investments                          \n                                              \nThe majority of the amounts for equity\ninvestments represent the carrying value of\nLIHTC investments held for sale calculated\nusing a discounted cash flow model.

We used the following methods\nand assumptions to estimate the fair value\namounts for these financial instruments.\n\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning\nDeposits with Banks\n\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying\namounts for Cash and due from banks and\nInterest-earning deposits with banks reported\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate\nfair value.\n\nSecurities Held to Maturity\n\nWe primarily use prices obtained from pricing\nservices, dealer quotes or recent trades to\ndetermine the fair value of securities. Refer\nto the Fair Value Measurement section of this\nNote 14 for additional information relating to\nour pricing processes and procedures.\n\nNet Loans\n\nFair values are estimated based on the\ndiscounted value of expected net cash flows\nincorporating assumptions about prepayment\nrates, net credit losses and servicing fees.\nNonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated\nrecovery value. The carrying value of Net\nloans are presented net of the ALLL.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 149\nOther Assets\n\nThe carrying value of Other assets, which\ninclude accrued interest receivable, cash\ncollateral, federal funds sold and resale\nagreements, certain loans held for sale, and\nFHLB and FRB stock, approximates fair value.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and\nFRB stock was $ 2.7billion and $ 2.5billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nDeposits\n\nFor time deposits, fair values are estimated\nby discounting contractual cash flows using\ncurrent market rates for instruments with\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing\nand interest-bearing demand and interest-\nbearing money market and savings deposits,\ncarrying values approximate fair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nFor short-term borrowed funds, including\nfederal funds purchased, commercial paper,\nrepurchase agreements and certain other short-\nterm borrowings and payables, carrying value\napproximates fair value. For long-term\nborrowed funds, quoted market prices are used,\nwhen available, to estimate fair value. When\nquoted market prices are not available, fair\nvalue is estimated based on current market\ninterest rates and credit spreads for debt\nwith similar terms and maturities.\n\nUnfunded Lending Related Commitments\n\nThe fair value of unfunded lending related\ncommitments is determined by market\nparticipant assumptions and takes into\nconsideration the impact of changes in\ninterest rates and credit. We establish a\nliability on these facilities based on the\ncreditworthiness of our counterparty.\n\nOther Liabilities\n\nOther liabilities includes interest-bearing\ncash collateral held related to derivatives\nand other accrued liabilities. Due to its\nshort-term nature, the carrying value of Other\nliabilities reported on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet approximates fair value.\n\n150 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair\nvalues, as well as the level within the fair\nvalue hierarchy, of these financial\ninstruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nare as follows:\nTable 84: Additional Fair Value Information\nRelated to Other Financial Instruments\n                                              \n                      \u2026                       \n                      2                       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n               $           \u2026                  \n                                  $           \n                           \u2026             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $           \u2026      $      $    \n                                              \n               $                  $           \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $                  $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $           \u2026                  \n                                  $           \n                           \u2026             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $           \u2026      $      $    \n                                              \n               $                  $           \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $                  $      $    \n                                              \nThe aggregate fair values in Table 84\nrepresent only a portion of the total market\nvalue of our assets and liabilities as, in\naccordance with the guidance related to fair\nvalues about financial instruments, we exclude\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 financial instruments recorded at fair value\non a recurring basis (as they are disclosed in\nTable 78),\n\n\u2022 investments accounted for under the equity\nmethod,\n\n\u2022 equity securities without a readily\ndeterminable fair value that apply for the\nalternative measurement approach to fair value\nunder ASU 2016-01,\n\n\u2022 real and personal property,\n\n\u2022 lease financing,\n\n\u2022 loan customer relationships,\n\n\u2022 deposit customer intangibles,\n\n\u2022 MSRs,\n\n\u2022 retail branch networks,\n\n\u2022 fee-based businesses, such as asset\nmanagement and brokerage,\n\n\u2022 trademarks and brand names,\n\n\u2022 trade receivables and payables due in one\nyear or less,\n\n\u2022 deposit liabilities with no defined or\ncontractual maturities under ASU 2016-01, and\n\n\u2022 insurance contracts.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 151\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  15 F                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  INANCIAL D ERIVATIVES                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to\nboth mitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risks inherent in\nour business activities, as well as to\nfacilitate customer risk management\nactivities.

Derivatives represent contracts\nbetween parties that usually require little or\nno initial net investment and result in one\nparty delivering cash or another type of asset\nto the other party based on a notional amount\nand an underlying as specified in the\ncontract.\n\nDerivative transactions are often measured in\nterms of notional amount, but this amount is\ngenerally not exchanged and it is not recorded\non the balance sheet.

Any\nnonperformance risk, including credit risk, is\nincluded in the determination of the estimated\nnet fair value of the derivatives. Further\ndiscussion on how derivatives are accounted\nfor is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk as part of our\nasset and liability risk management activities\nare designated as accounting hedges.\nDerivatives hedging the risks associated with\nchanges in the fair value of assets or\nliabilities are considered fair value hedges,\nderivatives hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are considered cash\nflow hedges and derivatives hedging a net\ninvestment in a foreign subsidiary are\nconsidered net investment hedges. Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow December 31,\n2023, we expect to reclassify net derivative\nlosses of $ 1.1billion pretax, or $ 0.9billion\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to December 31,\n2023. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is eight years.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n

foreign exchange rates. We\nassess whether the hedging relationship is\nhighly effective in achieving offsetting\nchanges in the value of the hedge and hedged\nitem by qualitatively verifying that the\ncritical terms of the hedge and hedged item\nmatch at the inception of the hedging\nrelationship and on an ongoing basis.

Net gains (losses) on net\ninvestment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI\nwere $( 53) million and $ 119million in 2023\nand 2022, respectively, and insignificant in\n2021.\n\nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging\nInstruments\n\nResidential mortgage loans that will be sold\nin the secondary market, and the related loan\ncommitments, which are considered derivatives,\nare accounted for at fair value. Changes in\nthe fair value of the loans and commitments\ndue to interest rate risk are hedged with\nforward contracts to sell mortgage-backed\nsecurities, as well as U.S. Treasury and\nEurodollar futures and options. Gains and\nlosses on the loans and commitments held for\nsale and the derivatives used to economically\nhedge them are included in Residential and\ncommercial mortgage noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\n\nResidential mortgage servicing rights are\naccounted for at fair value with changes in\nfair value influenced primarily by changes in\ninterest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the\nfair value of residential mortgage servicing\nrights include interest rate futures, swaps,\noptions and forward contracts to purchase\nmortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses\non residential mortgage servicing rights and\nthe related derivatives used for hedging are\nincluded in Residential and commercial\nmortgage noninterest income.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nthe related loan commitments, which are\nconsidered derivatives, are accounted for at\nfair value. Derivatives used to economically\nhedge these loans and commitments from changes\nin fair value due to interest rate risk\ninclude forward loan sale contracts and\ninterest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the\ncommitments, loans and derivatives are\nincluded in Residential and commercial\nmortgage noninterest income. Derivatives used\nto economically hedge the change in value of\ncommercial mortgage servicing rights include\ninterest rate futures, swaps and options.\nGains or losses on these derivatives are\nincluded in Residential and commercial\nmortgage noninterest income.\n\nThe residential and commercial mortgage loan\ncommitments associated with loans to be sold\nwhich are accounted for as derivatives are\nvalued based on the estimated fair value of\nthe underlying loan and the probability that\nthe loan will fund within the terms of the\ncommitment. The fair value also takes into\naccount the fair value of the embedded\nservicing right.\n\nWe offer derivatives to our customers in\nconnection with their risk management needs.\nThese derivatives primarily consist of\ninterest rate swaps, interest rate caps and\nfloors, swaptions, foreign exchange contracts\nand commodity swaps. We primarily manage our\nmarket risk exposure from customer\ntransactions by entering into a variety of\nhedging transactions with third-party dealers.\nGains and losses on customer-related\nderivatives are included in Capital markets\nand advisory noninterest income.\n\nIncluded in the customer, mortgage banking\nrisk management, and other risk management\nportfolios are written interest-rate caps and\nfloors entered into with customers and for\nrisk management purposes.

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nCollateral is typically exchanged daily on\nunsettled positions based on the net fair\nvalue of the positions with the counterparty\nas of the preceding day. Collateral\nrepresenting initial margin, which is based on\npotential future exposure, may also be\nrequired to be exchanged. In certain cases,\nminimum thresholds must be exceeded before any\ncollateral is exchanged. Any cash collateral\nexchanged with counterparties under these\nmaster netting agreements is also netted, when\nappropriate, against the applicable derivative\nfair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nHowever, the fair value of any securities held\nor pledged is not included in the net\npresentation on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. In order for derivative instruments\nunder a master netting agreement to be\neligible for closeout netting under GAAP, we\nmust conduct sufficient legal review to\nconclude with a well-founded basis that the\noffsetting rights included in the master\nnetting agreement would be legally enforceable\nupon an event of default, including upon an\nevent of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar\nproceeding of the counterparty. Enforceability\nis evidenced by a legal opinion that supports,\nwith sufficient confidence, the enforceability\nof the master netting agreement in such\ncircumstances.\n\nTable 90 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022. The table\nincludes cash collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nThe table also includes the fair value of any\nsecurities collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash and securities collateral amounts are\nincluded in the table only to the extent of\nthe related net derivative fair values.\n\nTable 90 includes OTC derivatives not settled\nthrough an exchange (\u201cOTC derivatives\u201d) and\nOTC derivatives cleared through a central\nclearing house (\u201cOTC cleared derivatives\u201d).\nOTC derivatives represent contracts executed\nbilaterally with counterparties that are not\nsettled through an organized exchange or\ndirectly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house that then becomes our\ncounterparty. OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\n\n156 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\nTable 90: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, cash and debt securities\n(primarily agency mortgage-backed securities)\ntotaling $ 2.3billion were pledged to us under\nmaster netting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements, and we pledged\ncash and debt securities (primarily agency\nmortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n1.9billion under these agreements to\ncollateralize net derivative liabilities owed\nto counterparties and to meet initial margin\nrequirements. These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet.

Benefits are determined using a\ncash balance formula where earnings credits\nare a percentage of eligible compensation.\nEarnings credit percentages for those\nemployees who were plan participants on\nDecember 31, 2009 are frozen at the level\nearned to that point. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who became participants on or after\nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible\ncompensation. All participants as of December\n31, 2009 earn a minimum rate on their cash\nbalances; new participants on or after January\n1, 2010 earn interest credits on their cash\nbalances based on 30-year Treasury securities.\nNew participants on or after January 1, 2010\nare not subject to the minimum rate. The plan\nprovides for a minimum annual earnings credit\namount of $ 2,000, subject to eligibility\ncriteria. Pension contributions to the plan\nare typically based on an actuarially\ndetermined amount necessary to fund total\nbenefits payable to plan participants. Assets\nof the qualified pension plan are held in a\nseparate Trust.\n\nWe also maintain nonqualified supplemental\nretirement plans for certain employees and\nprovide certain health care and life insurance\nbenefits for qualifying retired employees\n(postretirement benefits) through various\nplans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or\nmake changes to these plans at any time. The\nnonqualified pension plan is unfunded.\nContributions from PNC, and participant\ncontributions in the case of the\npostretirement benefit plans, cover all\nbenefits paid under the nonqualified pension\nplan and postretirement benefit plans. The\npostretirement plan provides benefits to\ncertain retirees that are at least actuarially\nequivalent to those provided by Medicare Part\nD and accordingly, we receive a federal\nsubsidy. PNC has established a VEBA to\npartially fund postretirement medical and life\ninsurance benefit obligations.\n\nWe use a measurement date of December 31 for\nplan assets and benefit obligations.\nA

Plan\u2019s\ninvestment managers. Certain domestic equity\ninvestment managers utilize derivatives and\nfixed income securities as described in their\nInvestment Management Agreements to achieve\ntheir investment objective under the\nInvestment Policy Statement. Other investment\nmanagers may invest in eligible securities\noutside of their assigned asset category to\nmeet their investment objectives. The actual\npercentage of the fair value of total Plan\nassets held as of December 31, 2023 for equity\nsecurities, fixed income securities, real\nestate and all other assets are 67%, 23%, 5%\nand 5%, respectively.\n\nWe believe that, over the long term, asset\nallocation is the single greatest determinant\nof risk. Asset allocation will deviate from\nthe target percentages due to market movement,\ncash flows, investment manager performance and\nimplementation of shifts under the dynamic\nasset allocation policy. Material deviations\nfrom the asset allocation targets can alter\nthe expected return and risk of the Trust.\nHowever, frequent rebalancing of the asset\nallocation targets may result in significant\ntransaction costs, which can impair the\nTrust\u2019s ability to meet its investment\nobjective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is\nperiodically rebalanced to maintain asset\nallocation within the target ranges described\nabove.\n\nIn addition to being diversified across asset\nclasses, the Trust is diversified within each\nasset class.

   \n(a) Rate disclosed is for the qualified\npension plan.\n(b) Rate is applicable only to the\npostretirement benefit plans.\nThe discount rates are determined\nindependently for each plan by comparing the\nexpected future benefits that will be paid\nunder each plan with yields available on high\nquality corporate bonds of similar duration.\nFor this analysis, 10% of bonds with the\nhighest yields and 40% with the lowest yields\nwere removed from the bond universe.\n\nWith all other assumptions held constant, a\n0.50% decline in the discount rate would have\nresulted in an immaterial change in net\nperiodic benefit cost in 2023 and to be\nrecognized in 2024 for each of the qualified\npension, nonqualified pension and\npostretirement benefit plans.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-\nterm assumption established by considering\nhistorical and anticipated returns of the\nasset classes invested in by the pension plan\nand the allocation strategy currently in place\namong those classes. For purposes of setting\nand reviewing this assumption, \u201clong-term\u201d\nrefers to the period over which the plan\u2019s\nprojected benefit obligations will be\ndisbursed. We review this assumption at each\nmeasurement date and adjust it if warranted.\nOur selection process references certain\nhistorical data and the current environment,\nbut primarily utilizes qualitative judgment\nregarding future return expectations. We also\nexamine the assumption used by other companies\nwith similar pension investment strategies.\nTaking into account all of these factors, the\nexpected\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 163\nlong-term return on plan assets for\ndetermining net periodic pension cost for 2023\nwas 6.20%. We are increasing our expected\nlong-term return on assets to 6.60% for\ndetermining pension cost for 2024. This\ndecision was made after considering the views\nof both internal and external capital market\nadvisors, particularly with regard to the\neffects of the recent economic environment on\nlong-term prospective equity and fixed income\nreturns.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nThe ISP is a qualified defined contribution\nplan that covers all of our eligible\nemployees. Newly-hired full time employees and\npart-time employees who are eligible to\nparticipate in the ISP are automatically\nenrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal\nto 4% of eligible compensation in the absence\nof an affirmative election otherwise. Employee\nbenefits expense related to the ISP was $\n188million in 2023, $ 175million in 2022 and $\n168million in 2021, representing cash\ncontributed to the ISP by PNC.\n\nThe ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes a frozen\nemployee stock ownership feature.

Certain Incentive Plan\nawards may be paid in stock, cash or a\ncombination of stock and cash. We typically\ngrant a substantial portion of our stock-based\ncompensation awards during the first quarter\nof each year.\n\nPerformance Share Unit Awards and Restricted\nShare Unit Awards\n\nPNC grants share unit awards that are based on\nperformance, service and certain metrics tied\nto market conditions. The fair value of\nnonvested performance share unit awards and\nrestricted share unit awards is initially\ndetermined based on prices not less than the\nmarket value of our common stock on the date\nof grant with a reduction for estimated\nforfeitures. Fair value of some performance\nawards are based on a Monte Carlo model, with\nsubsequent remeasurement based on the\nachievement of one or more performance goals.\nAdditionally, certain performance share unit\nawards could require subsequent adjustment due\nto certain discretionary risk review triggers.\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of\nperformance share unit awards and restricted\nshare unit awards granted in 2023, 2022 and\n2021 was $ 154.91, $ 198.28and $ 161.04per\nshare, respectively.

Effective for the first quarter of\n2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition\nperiod, and the full impact of the CECL\nstandard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, PNC and PNC\nBank were both considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\nbased on applicable U.S. regulatory capital\nratio requirements.\nThe following table sets forth the Basel III\nregulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, for PNC and PNC Bank:\nTable 107: Basel Regulatory Capital (a)\n                                              \n         \u2026  \u2026              \u2026                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026           \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Calculated using the regulatory capital\nmethodology applicable to us during both 2023\nand 2022.\nThe principal source of parent company cash\nflow is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nAlso, there are statutory and regulatory\nlimitations on the ability of national banks\nto pay dividends or make other capital\ndistributions. The amount available for\ndividend payments to the parent company by PNC\nBank without prior regulatory approval was\napproximately $ 6.3billion at December 31,\n2023.\n\nUnder federal law, a bank subsidiary generally\nmay not extend credit to, or engage in other\ntypes of covered transactions (including the\npurchase of assets) with, the parent company\nor its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and\nunder circumstances that are not substantially\nthe same as comparable transactions with\nnonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not\nextend credit to, or engage in a covered\ntransaction with, the parent company or a non-\nbank subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the\nbank\u2019s extensions of credit and other covered\ntransactions with the parent company or non-\nbank subsidiary exceeds 10% of the capital\nstock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or\nthe aggregate amount of the bank\u2019s extensions\nof credit and other covered transactions with\nthe parent company and all\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 167\nnon-bank subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the\ncapital stock and surplus of such bank\nsubsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with\nlimited exceptions, must be at least fully\ncollateralized in accordance with specified\ncollateralization thresholds, with the\nthresholds varying based on the type of assets\nserving as collateral. In certain\ncircumstances, federal regulatory authorities\nmay impose more restrictive limitations.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is authorized to establish\nreserve requirements for certain types of\ndeposits and other liabilities of depository\ninstitutions. Effective March 26, 2020, the\nreserve requirement ratios were reduced to\nzero. At December 31, 2023, the balance\noutstanding at the Federal Reserve Bank was $\n43.3billion. This amount is included in\nInterest-earning deposits with banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to\nimplement a special assessment, in connection\nwith the systemic risk determination announced\nin March 2023, to recover the cost associated\nwith protecting uninsured depositors following\nthe closures of Silicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank. Under the rule, the FDIC will\ncollect from PNC, along with other BHCs and\ninsured depository institutions, special\nassessments at an annual rate of approximately\n13.4 basis points of an institution\u2019s\nuninsured deposits reported as of December 31,\n2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5\nbillion), over eight quarterly assessment\nperiods, beginning after the first quarter of\n2024. Because the losses to the Deposit\nInsurance Fund from the systemic risk\nexception are estimated, the FDIC will\nperiodically adjust the estimate, which could\nresult in extending the special assessment for\nadditional quarters, imposing a final special\nassessment on a one-time basis if actual\nlosses exceed the amounts collected, or cease\ncollection early if the FDIC has collected\nenough to recover actual losses. Based on the\nrule, PNC incurred expense of $ 515million\npre-tax, or $ 407million after-tax, during the\nfourth quarter of 2023, representing the total\nestimated cost of the assessment.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  20 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 20). For\nDisclosed Matters where we are able to\nestimate such possible losses or ranges of\npossible losses, as of December 31, 2023, we\nestimate that it is reasonably possible that\nwe could incur losses in excess of related\naccrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate\namount less than $ 300million. The estimates\nincluded in this amount are based on our\nanalysis of currently available information\nand are subject to significant judgment and a\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties. As\nnew information is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nIn our experience, legal proceedings are\ninherently unpredictable. One or more of the\nfollowing factors frequently contribute to\nthis inherent unpredictability: the proceeding\nis in its early stages; the damages sought are\nunspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is\nunclear whether a case brought as a class\naction will be allowed to proceed on that\nbasis or, if permitted to proceed as a class\naction, how the class will be defined; the\nother party is seeking relief other than or in\naddition to compensatory damages (including,\nin the case of regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations and inquiries, the possibility\nof fines and penalties); the matter presents\nmeaningful legal uncertainties, including\nnovel issues of law; we have not engaged in\nmeaningful settlement discussions; discovery\nhas not started or is not complete; there are\nsignificant facts in dispute; the possible\noutcomes may not be amenable to the use of\nstatistical or quantitative analytical tools;\npredicting possible outcomes depends on making\nassumptions about future decisions of courts\nor regulatory bodies or the behavior of other\nparties; and there are a large number of\nparties named as defendants (including where\nit is uncertain how damages or liability, if\nany, will be shared among multiple\ndefendants). Generally, the less progress that\nhas been made in the proceedings or the\nbroader the range of potential results, the\nharder it is for us to estimate losses or\nranges of losses that it is reasonably\npossible we could incur.\n\nAs a result of these types of factors, we are\nunable, at this time, to estimate the losses\nthat are reasonably possible to be incurred or\nranges of such losses with respect to some of\nthe Disclosed Matters, and the aggregate\nestimated amount provided above does not\ninclude an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information\n\n168 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nof this type may provide insight into the\npotential magnitude of a matter, it does not\nnecessarily represent our estimate of\nreasonably possible loss or our judgment as to\nany currently appropriate accrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nBeginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust\nlawsuits were filed against Visa \u00ae ,\nMastercard \u00ae , and several major financial\ninstitutions, including cases naming National\nCity (since merged into The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary,\nNational City Bank of Kentucky (since merged\ninto National City Bank, which, in turn, was\nmerged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these\ncases are merchants operating commercial\nbusinesses throughout the U.S., as well as\ntrade associations. Some of these cases\n(including those naming National City\nentities) were brought as class actions on\nbehalf of all persons or business entities\nthat have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The\ncases have been consolidated for pre-trial\nproceedings in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of New York under the caption\nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and\nMerchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master\nFile No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JO).\n\nIn November 2016, the district court appointed\nseparate interim class counsel for a proposed\nclass seeking damages and a proposed class\nseeking equitable (injunctive) relief. In\nFebruary 2017, each of these counsel filed a\nproposed amended and supplemental complaint on\nbehalf of its respective proposed class. These\ncomplaints make similar allegations, including\nthat the defendants conspired to monopolize\nand to fix the prices for general purpose card\nnetwork services, that the restructuring of\nVisa and Mastercard, each of which included an\ninitial public offering, violated the\nantitrust laws, and that the defendants\notherwise imposed unreasonable restraints on\ntrade, resulting in the payment of inflated\ninterchange fees and other fees, which also\nviolated the antitrust laws. In their\ncomplaints, collectively the plaintiffs seek,\namong other things, injunctive relief,\nunspecified damages (trebled under the\nantitrust laws) and attorneys\u2019 fees. PNC is\nnamed as a defendant in the complaint seeking\ndamages but is not named as a defendant in the\ncomplaint that seeks equitable relief.\n\nIn September 2017, the magistrate judge at the\ndistrict court granted in part and denied in\npart the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to file their\nproposed amended complaints. The dispute over\namendment arose in part from the decision in\nUnited States v. American Express, Co., 838\nF.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), in which the court\nheld that the relevant market in a similar\ncomplaint against American Express is \u201ctwo-\nsided,\u201d i.e ., requires consideration of\neffects on consumers as well as merchants. In\nJune 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed\n(under the caption Ohio v. American Express\nCo. ) the court of appeal\u2019s decision .\nPreviously, the plaintiffs in this litigation\nhad alleged a one-sided market, and, as a\nresult of the court\u2019s decision in American\nExpress , they sought leave to add claims\nbased on a two-sided market. The order allowed\nthe complaint to be amended to include\nallegations pertaining to a two-sided market\nonly to the extent those claims are not time-\nbarred, but held that the two-sided market\nallegations do not relate back to the time of\nthe original complaint and are not subject to\ntolling. In October 2017, the plaintiffs\nappealed this order to the presiding district\ncourt judge. In August 2018, the judge\noverruled this decision, finding that the two-\nsided market allegations do relate back.\n\nIn September 2018, the relevant parties\nentered an amended definitive agreement to\nresolve the claims of the class seeking\ndamages. In this amended settlement agreement,\nthe parties agreed, among other things, to the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\u2022 An additional settlement payment from all\ndefendants of $ 900million, with Visa\u2019s share\nof the additional settlement payment being $\n600million. The additional settlement payment\nwill be added to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously paid by the defendants\npursuant to the original 2012 settlement\nagreement.\n\n\u2022 Up to $ 700million may be returned to the\ndefendants (with up to $ 467million to Visa)\nif more than 15% of class members (by payment\nvolume) opt out of the class. As more than 15%\nof class members opted out of the class, $\n700million has been returned to the defendants\n($ 467million to Visa).\n\nThe district court granted final approval of\nthe settlement in December 2019. Several\nobjectors appealed the district court\u2019s order\ngranting final approval to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. In March 2023,\nthe court of appeals affirmed the district\ncourt\u2019s approval in all material respects.\nLater in March, certain objectors petitioned\nfor rehearing in the court of appeals by\neither the panel that decided the appeal or\nthe court en banc. Some merchants that opted\nout from the settlement have brought lawsuits\nagainst Visa and Mastercard and one or more of\nthe issuing banks. Resolution by Visa of\nclaims by merchants that opted out of the\nsettlement, including those that file\nlawsuits, have been or will be paid from the\nVisa litigation escrow account.\n\nNational City and National City Bank entered\ninto judgment and loss sharing agreements with\nVisa and certain other banks with respect to\nall of the above referenced litigation. We\nwere not originally named as defendants in any\nof the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust\nlitigation nor were we initially parties to\nthe judgment or loss sharing agreements.\nHowever, we became responsible for National\nCity\u2019s and National City Bank\u2019s position in\nthe litigation and responsibilities under the\nagreements through our acquisition of National\nCity. In addition, following Visa\u2019s\nreorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its\ninitial public offering, U.S. Visa members\nreceived shares of Class B Visa common stock,\nconvertible upon resolution of specified\nlitigation, including the remaining litigation\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 169\ndescribed above, into shares of Class A Visa\ncommon stock, with the conversion rate\nadjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed\nto resolve the specified litigation, and also\nremained responsible for indemnifying Visa\nagainst the specified litigation. Our Class B\nVisa common stock is all subject to this\nconversion adjustment provision, and we are\nnow responsible for the indemnification\nobligations of our predecessors as well as\nourselves. In January 2024, Visa\u2019s\nstockholders approved amendments to its\nCertificate of Incorporation to institute a\nconversion and exchange offer program that\nwill result in the conversion of Visa\u2019s Class\nB common stock to Class B-1 common stock and\npermit Visa to release transfer restrictions\non a portion of the redenominated Class B\ncommon stock. In the initial potential\nexchange offer, a holder of Class B-1 common\nstock will have the ability to exchange some\nor all of its Class B-1 common stock for one-\nhalf of newly issued shares of Class B-2\ncommon stock and one-half of newly issued\nshares of Class C common stock. Subject to\ncertain restrictions, the Class C shares could\nthen be sold on the open market, at which\npoint they would be automatically converted\ninto Visa's Class A common stock at the then-\napplicable conversion rate. Additional such\nexchanges taking place no less than one year\napart may occur that permit a holder of Visa\u2019s\nredenominated Class B common stock to exchange\nup to half of its then held redenominated\nClass B common stock into Visa\u2019s Class C\ncommon stock. The exchanges are subject to the\napplicable stockholder agreeing to make-whole\nagreements that subject them to the same\nindemnity obligations to Visa as are currently\npresent.\n\nWe have also entered into a Mastercard\nSettlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with\nMastercard and other financial institution\ndefendants and an Omnibus Agreement Regarding\nInterchange Litigation Sharing and Settlement\nSharing with Visa, Mastercard and other\nfinancial institution defendants. The Omnibus\nAgreement, in substance, apportions resolution\nof the claims in this litigation into a Visa\nportion and a Mastercard portion, with the\nVisa portion being two-thirds and the\nMastercard portion being one-third. This\napportionment only applies in the case of\neither a global settlement involving all\ndefendants or an adverse judgment against the\ndefendants, to the extent that damages either\nare related to the merchants\u2019 inter-network\nconspiracy claims or are otherwise not\nattributed to specific Mastercard or Visa\nconduct or damages. The Mastercard portion (or\nany Mastercard-related liability not subject\nto the Omnibus Agreement) will then be\napportioned under the Mastercard Settlement\nand Judgment Sharing Agreement among\nMastercard and PNC and the other financial\ninstitution defendants that are parties to\nthis agreement. The responsibility for the\nVisa portion (or any Visa-related liability\nnot subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be\napportioned under the pre-existing\nindemnification responsibilities and judgment\nand loss sharing agreements.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn September 2020, USAA filed a lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A. (Case No. 2:20-cv-319)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (the \u201cfirst Texas case\u201d). USAA\namended its complaint in December 2020. As\namended, the complaint alleges that PNC\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit capture systems infringe\nfour patents owned by USAA. USAA seeks, among\nother things, a judgment that PNC is\ninfringing each of the patents, damages for\nwillful infringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nPNC, in its answer, alleged that USAA\ninfringed four of PNC\u2019s patents and that PNC\nseeks, among other things, a judgment that\nUSAA is infringing each of the patents,\ndamages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. In March 2022, the court\nsevered PNC\u2019s infringement allegations from\nthe first Texas case and in June 2022 opened a\nnew case ( United Services Automobile\nAssociation v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case No.\n2:22-cv-193) (the \u201cfourth Texas case\u201d)).\n\nIn December 2020, we filed a lawsuit ( PNC\nBank, NA v. United Services Automobile\nAssociation (Case No. 2:20-cv-1886) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania against USAA seeking\ndeclaratory judgment of non-infringement as to\ntwo of the patents at issue in the first Texas\ncase and awarding PNC its fees and costs. In\nJune 2021, the court stayed and\nadministratively closed this case pending the\ncourt in the first Texas case ruling that the\ncase should be transferred to the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. In September 2021,\nthe court in the first Texas case denied PNC\u2019s\nmotion to transfer the case to the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn March 2021, USAA filed a second lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-110)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (the \u201csecond Texas case\u201d). The\ncomplaint alleges that PNC\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe an additional\ntwo patents owned by USAA. USAA seeks, among\nother things, a judgment that PNC is\ninfringing each of the patents, damages for\nwillful infringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The\nfirst Texas case and the second Texas case\nwere consolidated (together, the \u201cfirst\nconsolidated cases\u201d). At trial, in May 2022,\nonly four of the original six USAA patents\nraised in its complaints were asserted against\nPNC, including U.S. Patent No. 8,977,571\n(\u2018571). Following the jury trial in the first\nconsolidated cases, the jury found against PNC\nfor willful infringement of at least one of\nUSAA\u2019s asserted patent claims and awarded\napproximately $ 218million. Subsequently, PNC\nfiled post-trial motions for judgment as a\nmatter of law and for a new trial, all of\nwhich the court denied. In April 2023, PNC\nnoticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit ( United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 23-1778)) regarding the final judgment\nentered against PNC. Briefing for Case No.\n23-1778 is now complete, and the parties are\nwaiting for the appeal to be calendared.\n\nIn July 2021, USAA filed a third lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-246)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (the \u201cthird Texas case\u201d). The\ncomplaint alleges that PNC\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems, including its new\nversions, infringe three additional patents\nowned by USAA. USAA seeks, among other things,\na judgment that PNC is infringing each of the\npatents, damages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. In June 2022, the court\nconsolidated the fourth Texas case into the\nthird Texas case (together, \u201cthe second\nconsolidated cases\u201d). At trial in September\n2022, only two of the original three USAA\npatents were asserted against PNC, including\nU.S. Patent No. 10,769,598 (\u2018598), and only\ntwo of the original four PNC patents were\nasserted against USAA. Following\n\n170 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2023 Form 10-K\n\nthe jury trial in the second consolidated\ncases, the jury found against PNC for\ninfringement of at least one of the two\nasserted patents and awarded $ 4.3million, and\ndetermined that PNC did not willfully infringe\nthe patents. The jury further found that USAA\ndid not infringe any of PNC\u2019s asserted\npatents. Subsequently, USAA filed a motion for\na new trial on damages, and, in April 2023,\nthe court denied USAA\u2019s motion. In March 2023,\nPNC noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit regarding the\nfinal judgment entered against PNC and in\nApril 2023, USAA noticed a cross-appeal to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\nregarding the final judgment. These appeals\nwere consolidated as United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 23-1639). Briefing for Case No. 23-1639 is\nnow complete and the parties are waiting on\nthe appeal to be calendared.\n\nIn August 2021, USAA filed a lawsuit ( United\nServices Automobile Association v. BBVA USA\n(Case No. 2:21-cv-311)) in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas against BBVA USA for patent infringement\n(the \u201cBBVA USA Texas case\u201d). The complaint\nalleges that BBVA USA\u2019s remote deposit capture\nsystems infringe the same six USAA patents at\nissue in the first consolidated cases. USAA\nseeks, among other things, a judgment that\nBBVA USA is infringing each of the patents,\ndamages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. In October 2021, BBVA USA was\nmerged into PNC Bank. In June 2022, the court\nentered a stipulation proposed by the parties,\nstayed all deadlines, and administratively\nclosed the matter.\n\nIn January 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard granted institution of inter partes\nreview (\u201cIPR\u201d) with respect to petitions filed\nby PNC for three of the six patents then at\nissue in the first consolidated cases and in\nthe BBVA USA Texas case. Because of USAA\u2019s\ncase narrowing in the first consolidated\ncases, only one of these three patents being\nreviewed (U.S. Patent No. \u2018571) was presented\nto the jury in the first consolidated cases.\nIn January 2023, with respect to the three\npatents in which an IPR was instituted, the\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board entered its\nFinal Written Decisions and found all of the\nchallenged claims were unpatentable. With\nrespect to U.S. Patent No. \u2018571, in June 2023,\nUSAA noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit challenging\nthe Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u2019s Final\nWritten Decision, which became United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 23-2125). USAA, in May and June 2023, also\nappealed the Final Written Decisions\ninvalidating the claims of the patents not\npresented to the jury which became United\nServices Automobile Association v. PNC Bank\nN.A. (Case No. 2023-2124) and United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 23-1920). Two of these appeals (Case Nos.\n23-2124 and 23-2125) were consolidated.\nBriefing for Case No. 23-1920 is now complete\nand the parties are waiting on the appeal to\nbe calendared.\n\nIn May and June 2022, the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board granted institution of IPR with\nrespect to petitions filed by PNC for two of\nthe three patents then at issue in the third\nTexas case. Because of USAA\u2019s case narrowing\nin the third Texas case, only one of these two\npatents being reviewed (U.S. Patent No. \u2018598)\nwas presented to the jury in the third Texas\ncase. With respect to U.S. Patent No. \u2018598, in\nMay 2023, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\nentered its Final Written Decision holding\nmost of the claims of this patent unpatentable\nand other claims were patentable. Both\nparties, in July 2023, appealed the Final\nWritten Decision, with USAA appealing first (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A. (Case No. 23-2171) and PNC being the\ncross-appellant ( PNC Bank N.A. v. United\nServices Automobile Association (Case No.\n23-2172)). These appeals were consolidated.\nWith respect to the other patent (which was\nnot presented to the jury), the Patent Trial\nand Appeal Board entered its Final Written\nDecision in June 2023 and held all of the\nclaims unpatentable. USAA, in August 2023,\nappealed from this decision which became\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A. (Case No. 23-2244).\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad range of\nissues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage,\nsecurities and other financial services\nbusinesses, as well as other aspects of our\noperations. In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of reviews of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries have involved\nand may in the future involve or lead to\nregulatory enforcement actions and other\nadministrative proceedings. These inquiries\nhave also led to and may in the future lead to\ncivil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some\nof these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences. Our practice is to cooperate\nfully with regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations, audits and other inquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described above, PNC and persons to\nwhom we may have indemnification obligations,\nin the normal course of business, are subject\nto various other pending and threatened legal\nproceedings in which claims for monetary\ndamages and other relief are asserted. We do\nnot anticipate, at the present time, that the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of such other legal proceedings will have\na material adverse effect on our financial\nposition. However, we cannot now determine\nwhether or not any claims asserted against us\nor others to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, whether in the proceedings or\nother matters described above or otherwise,\nwill have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations in any future reporting\nperiod, which will depend on, among other\nthings, the amount of the loss resulting from\nthe claim and the amount of income otherwise\nreported for the reporting period.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 171\n

The decline in\nOther earnings for 2023 compared to prior\nyears was driven by the residual impacts from\nfund transfer pricing due to the rising\ninterest rate environment, along with the\ncosts for the FDIC special assessment and the\nworkforce reduction.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nFund Transfer Pricing\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology which is designed to\nconsider interest rate and liquidity risks.\nUnder our methodology, assets receive a\nfunding charge while liabilities and capital\nreceive a funding credit based on market\ninterest rates, product characteristics, and\nother factors.\n\nOur transfer pricing framework considers the\napplication of funding curves and\nmethodologies consistently across the balance\nsheet. A residual gain or loss from funds\ntransfer pricing operations is retained within\nOther.

The objective of the\nstandard is to clarify the principles for\nrecognizing revenue from contracts with\ncustomers across all industries and to develop\na common revenue standard under GAAP. The\nstandard requires the application of a five-\nstep recognition model to contracts,\nallocating the amount of consideration we\nexpect to be entitled to across distinct\npromises in the contract, called performance\nobligations, and recognizing revenue when or\nas those services are transferred to the\ncustomer.\n\nFee-based revenue within the scope of Topic\n606 is recognized within our threereportable\nbusiness segments: Retail Banking, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking and Asset Management\nGroup. Interest income, income from lease\ncontracts, fair value gains from financial\ninstruments (including derivatives), income\nfrom mortgage servicing rights and guarantee\nproducts, letter of credit fees, non-\nrefundable fees associated with acquiring or\noriginating a loan and gains from the sale of\nfinancial assets are outside of the scope of\nTopic 606.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2023\n                                 Form 10-K 175\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nupdated the presentation of its noninterest\nincome categorization to be based on product\nand service type, and accordingly, has changed\nthe basis of presentation of its noninterest\nincome revenue streams to: (i) Asset\nmanagement and brokerage, (ii) Capital markets\nrelated, (iii) Card and cash management, (iv)\nLending and deposit services, (v) Residential\nand commercial mortgage and (vi) Other\nnoninterest income.
