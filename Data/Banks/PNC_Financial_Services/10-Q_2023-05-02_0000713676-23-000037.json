per diluted common\nshare, for the fourth quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to a lower provision for credit\nlosses and a decline in expenses, partially\noffset by decreased net interest income and\nnoninterest income.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended March 31, 2023\ncompared to the three months ended December\n31, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue decreased $160 million, or 3%,\nto $5.6 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income of $3.6 billion\ndecreased $99 million, or 3%, driven by two\nfewer days in the quarter and higher funding\ncosts, partially offset by higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets.\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin decreased 8 basis points\nto 2.84% as higher yields on interest-earning\nassets were more than offset by increased\nfunding costs.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $61 million, or\n3%, and included lower merger and acquisition\nadvisory activity as well as seasonally lower\nconsumer transaction volumes.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses of $235 million\nin the first quarter of 2023 included the\nimpact of updated economic assumptions and\nchanges in portfolio composition and quality.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 included a\nprovision for credit losses of $408 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense decreased $153 million,\nor 4%, to $3.3 billion, reflecting strong\nexpense control and lower personnel costs,\nprimarily due to lower variable compensation\nrelated to decreased business activity as well\nas seasonally lower benefits expense.\n\n\u2022 We generated positive operating leverage of\n2%.\n\nNet income of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per\ndiluted common share, for the first quarter of\n2023 increased $265 million, or 19%, compared\nto $1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common\nshare, for the first quarter of 2022, as a\nresult of higher net interest income and\nnoninterest income, partially offset by a\nhigher provision for credit losses and\nincreased expenses.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended March 31, 2023\ncompared to the three months ended March 31,\n2022:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $911 million, or\n19%, to $5.6 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income increased $781 million,\nor 28%, as a result of higher interest-earning\nasset yields and balances, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 56 basis\npoints, reflecting the benefit of higher\nyields on interest-earning assets.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $130 million,\nor 7%, as a result of business growth across\nthe franchise as well as higher private equity\nrevenue, partially offset by the impact of\nlower average equity markets.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $149 million,\nor 5%, due to higher personnel costs, an\nincreased FDIC assessment rate and continued\ninvestments in technology and marketing to\nsupport business growth.\n\n\u2022 We generated positive operating leverage

          \n                                              \nOur balance sheet was strong and well\npositioned at March 31, 2023. In comparison to\nDecember 31, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased modestly, to $561.8\nbillion.\n\n\u2022 Total loans remained largely stable at\n$326.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans increased modestly to\n$225.4 billion as new production and higher\nutilization of loan commitments were largely\noffset by payoffs and maturities.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans were relatively stable\nat $101.1 billion as increases in home equity,\nresidential mortgages and automobile loans\nwere offset by declines in the remaining\nportfolios as paydowns outpaced new\noriginations.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities decreased $1.1 billion\nto $138.2 billion, due to prepayments and\nmaturities outpacing purchases, partially\noffset by the favorable impact of interest\nrate changes on net unrealized losses for\navailable for sale securities.\n\n\u2022 Interest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the Federal Reserve Bank,\nincreased $6.5 billion, or 24%, to $33.9\nbillion, primarily due to higher borrowed\nfunds and deposits. In the first quarter of\n2023, Interest-earning deposits with banks\nalso included a $1.0 billion uninsured deposit\nwith First Republic Bank. The deposit was\nacquired out of First Republic Bank's\nreceivership on May 1, 2023, and will be\nrepaid to PNC.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits increased $551 million to\n$436.8 billion as a result of higher consumer\ntime deposits, partially offset by seasonally\nlower commercial deposits, and reflected a\ncontinued shift from noninterest-bearing to\ninterest-bearing deposit products as interest\nrates have risen.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds increased $2.1 billion, or\n4%, to $60.8 billion as a result of parent\ncompany senior debt issuances in January 2023.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 3\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nThe first quarter of 2023 reflected solid\ncredit quality performance.\n\n\u2022 At March 31, 2023 compared to December 31,\n2022:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets of $2.0 billion were\nstable.\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion\ndecreased $164 million, or 11%, driven by\nlower consumer and commercial loan\ndelinquencies.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, totaled $5.4\nbillion at both March 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022. During the three months ended March\n31, 2023, reserves reflected our updated\neconomic assumptions and changes in portfolio\ncomposition and quality. ACL to total loans\nwas 1.66% and 1.67% at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs of $195 million, or 0.24% of\naverage loans, in the first quarter of 2023\ndecreased $29 million, or 13%, compared to\n$224 million, or 0.28% of average loans, for\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, due to lower\nconsumer and commercial net charge-offs.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Capital and Liquidity Highlights            \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital and liquidity\npositions.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity of $41.8 billion\nat March 31, 2023, increased $1.8 billion, or\n4%, compared to December 31, 2022, driven by\nthe benefit of net income and an increase in\nAOCI, partially offset by common dividends\npaid and share repurchases during the first\nquarter of 2023.\n\n\u2022 In the first quarter of 2023, PNC returned\n$1.0 billion of capital to shareholders,\nreflecting $0.6 billion of dividends on common\nshares and $0.4 billion of common share\nrepurchases, representing 2.4 million shares.\n\n\u2022 Consistent with the SCB framework, which\nallows for capital returns in amounts in\nexcess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of\nDirectors has authorized a repurchase\nframework under the previously approved\nrepurchase program of up to 100 million common\nshares, of which approximately 47% were still\navailable for repurchase at March 31, 2023.\nDue to recent market volatility and increased\neconomic uncertainty, share repurchase\nactivity is expected to be reduced in the\nsecond quarter of 2023 compared to recent\nquarters. PNC continues to evaluate and may\nadjust share repurchase activity, as actual\namounts and timing are dependent on market and\neconomic conditions as well as other factors.\nPNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter period that\nbegan October 1, 2022 is 2.9%.\n\n\u2022 On April 3, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.50 per share payable on May 5,\n2023.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.2% at March\n31, 2023 from 9.1% at December 31, 2022.\n\n\u2022 PNC elected a five-year transition provision\neffective March 31, 2020 to delay until\nDecember 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL\nstandard on regulatory capital, followed by a\nthree-year transition period. Effective for\nthe first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the\nthree-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the\nfull impact of CECL and exclude the benefits\nof this transition provision. The CET1 fully\nimplemented ratio was 9.1% at March 31, 2023\ncompared to 8.9% at December 31, 2022.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 was 108% and exceeded the\nregulatory minimum requirement throughout the\nquarter.\n\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nFinancial Review for more detail on our 2023\nliquidity and capital actions as well as our\ncapital ratios.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB\nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board in\nconnection with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nCCAR process.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 The economy continues to expand in the first\nhalf of 2023, but economic growth is slowing\nin response to the ongoing Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy tightening to slow inflation.\nThis has led to large increases in both short-\nand long-term interest rates. With much higher\nmortgage rates the housing market is already\nin contraction, with steep drops in existing\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nhome sales and single-family housing starts,\nand a modest decline in house prices. Other\nsectors where interest rates play an outsized\nrole, such as business investment and consumer\nspending on durable goods, will contract over\n2023.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s baseline outlook is for a recession\nstarting in the second half of 2023, with real\nGDP contracting less than 1% before recovery\nstarts in the first half of 2024 as the\nFederal Reserve lowers interest rates in\nresponse to a deteriorating labor market and\nslower inflation. The unemployment rate will\nincrease throughout 2023, peaking at above 5%\nin the second half of 2024. Inflation will\nslow with the recession and be back to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective by\nmid-2024.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points in May. This\nwould bring the federal funds rate to a range\nof 5.00% to 5.25% by early-May. PNC expects a\nfederal funds rate cut of 25 basis points in\nearly 2024 as inflation moves toward the\nFOMC\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2023, compared to\nthe first quarter of 2023, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down 2% to 4%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be stable to down 1%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, excluding net\nsecurities gains and Visa activity, to be $200\nmillion to $250 million,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be down approximately 3%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be $200 million to\n$250 million.\n\nFor the full year 2023, compared to the full\nyear of 2022, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up 5% to 7%,\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be up 1% to 3%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up 4% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be up 2% to 3%, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n18%.\n\nWe cannot provide, without unreasonable\neffort, a meaningful or accurate\nreconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP\nmeasures to their most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report.\n\nNet interest income decreased $99 million, or\n3%, for the first quarter of 2023 compared to\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, driven by two\nfewer days in the quarter and higher funding\ncosts, partially offset by higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets. Net interest income\nincreased $781 million, or 28%, for the first\nquarter of 2023 compared to the same period in\n2022, as a result of higher interest-earning\nasset yields and balances, partially offset by\nhigher funding costs. Net interest margin\ndecreased 8 basis points compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2022 as higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets were more than offset\nby increased funding costs. Compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2022, net interest margin\nincreased 56 basis points, reflecting the\nbenefit of higher yields on interest-earning\nassets.\n\nAverage investment securities of $143.4\nbillion were relatively stable for the first\nquarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter\nof 2022. Compared to the first quarter of\n2022, average investment securities increased\n$9.5 billion, or 7%, reflecting net purchases,\nprimarily of agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities. Average investment\nsecurities represented 28% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the first quarter\nof 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, and\n27% for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAverage loans of $325.5 billion for the first\nquarter of 2023 increased $3.7 billion\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2022,\nprimarily driven by growth in PNC\u2019s corporate\nbanking business during the fourth quarter of\n2022. In comparison to the first quarter of\n2022, average loans increased $34.8 billion,\nor 12%, reflecting growth in both commercial\nand consumer loans. Average loans represented\n64% of average interest-earning assets for\nboth the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth\nquarter of 2022, and 59% for the first quarter\nof 2022.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nof $34.1 billion for the first quarter of\n2023, increased $3.7 billion, or 12% compared\nto the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due\nto higher borrowed funds and deposits.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2022, average\ninterest-earning deposits with banks decreased\n$28.5 billion, or 46%, primarily due to higher\nloans outstanding.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits of $315.1\nbillion for the first quarter of 2023\nincreased $13.6 billion, or 5%, and $15.5\nbillion, or 5%, compared to the fourth and\nfirst quarters of 2022, respectively. Both\ncomparisons reflected a continued shift from\nnoninterest-bearing to interest-bearing\ndeposits, as interest rates have risen. In\ntotal, average interest-bearing deposits\nrepresented 83% of average interest-bearing\nliabilities for the first quarter of 2023, 84%\nfor the fourth quarter of 2022 and 91% for the\nfirst quarter of 2022.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAverage borrowed funds of $63.0 billion for\nthe first quarter of 2023 increased $3.7\nbillion, or 6%, compared to the fourth quarter\nof 2022, driven by parent company senior debt\nissuances in January 2023. Compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2022, average borrowed funds\nincreased $32.7 billion, or 108% due to\nincreased FHLB borrowings and senior debt\nissuances.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 36% for both the first quarter of\n2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022 compared\nto 40% for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees increased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2022,\nreflecting the impact of higher average equity\nmarkets and increased annuity sales. The\ndecrease compared to the first quarter of 2022\nreflected the impact of lower average equity\nmarkets. PNC\u2019s discretionary client assets\nunder management of $177 billion at March 31,\n2023 increased from $173 billion at December\n31, 2022, primarily as a result of higher spot\nequity markets. PNC\u2019s discretionary client\nassets under management decreased from $182\nbillion at March 31, 2022, driven by lower\nspot equity markets.\n\nCapital markets and advisory fees decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2022 driven\nby lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.\nThe increase compared to the first quarter of\n2022 included higher asset backed financing,\nmerger and acquisition advisory and\nunderwriting fees.\n\nCard and cash management revenue decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2022,\nreflecting seasonally lower consumer\ntransaction volumes. The increase in the first\nquarter of 2022 comparison was primarily due\nto increased treasury management product\nrevenue and higher consumer spending.\n\nLending and deposit services increased\ncompared to both the fourth and first quarters\nof 2022, primarily driven by increased client\nactivity.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to\nlower results from residential mortgage\nservicing rights valuation, net of economic\nhedge. The increase compared to the first\nquarter of 2022 was driven by modestly higher\ncommercial and residential banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income increased compared to\nboth the fourth quarter and first quarter of\n2022. The increase compared to the first\nquarter of 2022 included the impact of higher\nprivate equity revenue.

Average loans for\nthis business increased driven by strong new\nproduction throughout 2022 and higher average\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased largely due to new\nproduction throughout 2022, partially offset\nby a lower average utilization of loan\ncommitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased primarily\ndriven by new production and higher\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by PPP\nloan forgiveness and lower average utilization\nof loan commitments.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits decreased compared\nto the three months ended March 31, 2022,\nreflecting the impact of competitive pricing\ndynamics.

On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationship\nexists. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services. A discussion of the\nconsolidated revenue from these services\nfollows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nTreasury management revenue is reported in\nnoninterest income and net interest income.\nNoninterest income includes treasury\nmanagement product revenue less earnings\ncredits provided to customers on compensating\ndeposit balances used to pay for products and\nservices. Net interest income includes funding\ncredit from all treasury management customer\ndeposit balances. Compared to the first three\nmonths of 2022, treasury management revenue\nincreased due to wider interest rate spreads\non the value of deposits and higher\nnoninterest income.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities increased in the comparison\nprimarily due to a higher benefit from\ncommercial mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation, net of economic hedge and higher\nrevenue from commercial mortgage loans held\nfor sale, partially offset by lower commercial\nmortgage servicing income.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading. The increase in\ncapital markets and advisory fees in the\ncomparison was mostly driven by higher fees\nand credit valuation on customer-related\nderivative activities as well as

We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming).

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $40.9 billion at March 31, 2023\nwith 44% located in California. Comparable\namounts at December 31, 2022 were $40.6\nbillion and 44%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $19.9 billion of\nhome equity lines of credit and $6.3 billion\nof closed-end home equity installment loans at\nMarch 31, 2023. Comparable amounts were $19.5\nbillion and $6.5 billion as of December 31,\n2022, respectively. Home equity lines of\ncredit are a variable interest rate product\nwith fixed rate conversion options available\nto certain borrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\ntrack borrower performance of this portfolio\non a monthly basis. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit, or\nbrokered home equity lines of credit) and\ntrack the historical performance of any\nrelated mortgage loans regardless of whether\nwe hold such liens. This information is used\nfor internal reporting and risk management. As\npart of our overall risk analysis and\nmonitoring, we also segment the portfolio\nbased upon loan delinquency, nonperforming\nstatus, modification and bankruptcy status,\nFICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 19: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4,\u2026    19    %    $  5\u2026     19   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    12            3\u2026     13      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     9            2\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     8            2\u2026      8      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6,\u2026    24            6\u2026     24      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  26\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              56    %              58   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              44                   42      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n  \u2026       31,                  3\u2026             \n  \u2026       20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  773                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              67    %              67   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at March 31, 2023.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $13.8 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.1 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of March 31,\n2023.

The increase in\nthe comparison was attributable to higher net\ncharge-offs in our commercial portfolio, most\nnotably within the commercial and industrial\nloan class, partially offset by lower consumer\nnet charge-offs.\n\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022\nForm 10-K and Note 3 Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses of this Report for\nadditional information.\n                                              \n   Liquidity and Capital Management           \n                                              \nLiquidity risk, including our liquidity\nmonitoring measures and tools, is described in\nfurther detail in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement section of our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nOne of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for each of PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the first quarter of 2023.\nFluctuations in our average LCR result from\nchanges to the components of the calculation,\nincluding high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%.

Total deposits increased to\n$436.8 billion at March 31, 2023 from $436.3\nbillion at December 31, 2022, and included a\ncontinued shift from noninterest-bearing to\ninterest-bearing deposit products, as interest\nrates have risen. As of March 31, 2023,\nuninsured deposits represented approximately\n43% of our total deposit base. The majority of\nour uninsured deposits are related to\ncommercial operating and relationship\naccounts, which we define as commercial\ndeposit customers who utilize two or more PNC\nproducts. See the Funding Sources portion of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and\nBusiness Segments Review sections of this\nFinancial Review for additional information on\nour deposits and related strategies.\nAdditionally, certain liquid assets as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, our liquid assets consisted\nof cash and due from banks and short-term\ninvestments (federal funds sold, resale\nagreements, trading securities and interest-\nearning deposits with banks) totaling $43.5\nbillion and securities available for sale\ntotaling $43.2 billion. The level of liquid\nassets fluctuates over time based on many\nfactors, including market conditions, loan and\ndeposit growth and balance sheet management\nactivities. PNC pledges securities as\ncollateral to secure public and trust\ndeposits, repurchase agreements and for other\npurposes. Pledged securities included $28.1\nbillion of securities held to maturity and an\nimmaterial amount of available for sale and\ntrading securities.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings).

At March 31, 2023, PNC\nBank had $7.9 billion of notes outstanding\nunder this program of which $4.8 billion were\nsenior notes and $3.1 billion were\nsubordinated notes.\n\nPNC Bank maintains additional secured\nborrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh\nand through the Federal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nMarch 31, 2023, our unused secured borrowing\ncapacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the\nFederal Reserve Bank totaled $72.3 billion.\n\nIn March 2023, following the failures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the\nFederal Reserve created a new Bank Term\nFunding Program as an additional source of\nliquidity against high-quality securities. The\nprogram offers loans of up to one year in\nlength to eligible depository institutions,\nincluding PNC Bank, pledging certain\nqualifying assets as collateral, provided that\nsuch collateral was owned by the borrower as\nof March 12, 2023. See the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section in this Financial Review\nand Item 1A Risk Factors for further detail on\nthe risks related to the recent turmoil in the\nfinancial services industry and responsive\nmeasures to manage it.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity.

The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $13.9 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $3.6 billion at March 31, 2023.\nSee Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of our 2022 Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of these limitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Authorized by the Board of\nDirectors, the parent company has the ability\nto offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial\npaper to provide additional liquidity.

The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC\u2019s\nelection to adopt the CECL five-year\ntransition provisions. Effective for the first\nquarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the\nfull impact of CECL and excludes the benefits\nof the optional five-year transition.\n\n(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have\nelected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\n\n(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-\nweighted assets are based on the Basel III\nstandardized approach rules and include credit\nand market risk-weighted assets.\n\n(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account the quarterly average of both on\nbalance sheet assets as well as certain off-\nbalance sheet items, including loan\ncommitments and potential future exposure\nunder derivative contracts.\n\n(f) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, financial difficulty\nmodifications, past due exposures and equity\nexposures are generally subject to higher risk\nweights than other types of exposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. See additional discussion of this rule\nin the Supervision and Regulation section of\nItem 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of\nour 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on\napplicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and\na Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 33\nto withstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios.

For more discussion regarding the\ntransition from LIBOR, see Item 1 Risk Factors\nand the Risk Management section in Item 7 of\nour 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, PNC Bank ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate, except on a limited basis, as\npermissible. PNC is offering conforming\nadjustable-rate mortgages using SOFR instead\nof USD LIBOR, in line with Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac requirements, nonconforming\nadjustable-rate residential mortgages using\nSOFR and private education loans using Prime.\nAlternative rates, primarily SOFR and BSBY,\nare currently offered to our corporate and\ncommercial customers. The focus for all lines\nof business is planning for the cessation\nevent in June 2023 and client communication\nand outreach.\n\nThe Federal Reserve adopted a final rule\neffective February 27, 2023 that implements\nthe Adjustable Interest Rate LIBOR Act (the\n\u201cLIBOR Act\u201d) by identifying benchmark rates\nbased on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in\ncertain financial contracts after June 30,\n2023. The final rule identifies replacement\nbenchmark rates based on SOFR to replace\novernight, one-month, three-month, six-month,\nand 12-month LIBOR contracts subject to the\nLIBOR Act. These contracts include U.S.\ncontracts that do not mature before\npublication of LIBOR ends June 30, 2023, and\nthat lack adequate fallback provisions that\nwould replace LIBOR with a practicable\nreplacement benchmark rate.\n\nIn addition to the previously announced\ntransition of PNC\u2019s Series O, Series R and\nSeries S preferred stock to three-month CME\nTerm SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of\n0.26161% per annum (\u201cAdjusted 3-Month CME Term\nSOFR\u201d), PNC will also rely on the LIBOR Act\nand its implementing regulations to transition\nthe calculation of interest on the junior\nsubordinated debentures issued by The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. and owned by\nPNC Capital Trust C, a wholly-owned finance\nsubsidiary of The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc., as well as the calculation of\ndistributions on the trust preferred\nsecurities issued by PNC Capital Trust C.\nAdjusted 3-Month CME Term SOFR will be the\nreplacement reference rate and will be used\nwith respect to interest or distribution\nperiods, as applicable, with determination\ndates occurring after June 30, 2023. Further,\ntwo series of debt securities issued by a\npredecessor banking subsidiary, National City\nBank, will also rely on the LIBOR Act to\ntransition the calculation of interest. The\nNational City Bank Notes due April 1, 2043\nwill use Adjusted 3-Month CME Term SOFR as the\nreplacement reference rate for interest\nperiods with determination dates occurring\nafter June 30, 2023. The National City Bank\nNotes due April 1, 2037 will use one-month CME\nTerm SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of\n0.11448% per annum as the replacement\nreference rate with respect to interest\nperiods with determination dates occurring\nafter June 30, 2023.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 35\nPNC is actively working to address other\ncontracts without sufficient fallbacks in\nadvance of LIBOR cessation; however, PNC does\nexpect to leverage the LIBOR Act for its\nintended purpose to address difficult\nexposures when necessary. We anticipate these\nexposures to be a small subset of our overall\nportfolio.\n\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Customer-Related\nTrading Risk\n\nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities.We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. VaR is calculated for each of\nthe portfolios that comprise our customer-\nrelated trading activities of which the\nmajority are covered positions as defined by\nthe Market Risk Rule. VaR is computed with\npositions and market risk factors updated\ndaily to ensure each portfolio is operating\nwithin its acceptable limits.\n\nSee the Market Risk Management \u2013 Customer-\nRelated Trading Risk section of our 2022 Form\n10-K for more information on our models used\nto calculate VaR and our backtesting process.\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $84\nmillion for the three months ended March 31,\n2023, compared to $88 million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was\nmainly due to lower derivative client sales\nrevenue, offset by increases in client related\ntrading results.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets. In\naddition to extending credit, taking deposits,\nunderwriting securities and trading financial\ninstruments, we make and manage direct\ninvestments in a variety of transactions,\nincluding management buyouts,\nrecapitalizations and growth financings in a\nvariety of industries.

Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the March 31, 2023 per\nshare closing price of $225.46 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.3 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2022 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements. The estimated\nvalue does not represent fair value of the\nVisa B common shares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\n36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies.

By law, any losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured\ndepositors under the systemic risk exception\nmust be recovered by one or more special\nassessments on insured depository institutions\nor depository institution holding companies,\nor both. The FDIC has not yet announced the\namount or timeline of any special assessments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also created a new Bank\nTerm Funding Program as an additional source\nof liquidity against high-quality securities\nin order to make additional funding available\nto eligible depository institutions. This\nprogram offers loans of up to one year in\nlength to eligible depository institutions\npledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and\nmortgage-backed securities, and other\nqualifying assets as collateral, provided that\nsuch collateral was owned by the borrower as\nof March 12, 2023. These pledged assets will\nbe valued at par under the Program.

Among other things, the proposed rule\nwould lower the safe harbor dollar amount for\ncredit card late fees that issuers can charge\nto $8 regardless of whether the late payment\nis the initial or a subsequent late payment\nfrom $30 for an initial late payment and $41\nfor subsequent late payments. The proposal\nalso would eliminate the inflation adjustment\nto the safe harbor and cap late fees at 25% of\nthe consumer\u2019s required minimum payment. The\nproposal also seeks comment on, among other\nthings, whether to eliminate the safe harbor\nor to require a grace period of 15 calendar\ndays before a card issuer can impose a late\nfee.\n\nIn February 2023, the SEC proposed changes to\nthe rules under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940 governing the custody of client assets\nthat would increase the obligations of\nregistered investment advisers, such as PNC\nInvestments, PNC Capital Advisors, LLC, and\nPNC TC, LLC and impact PNC Bank in its role as\ncustodian for the clients of registered\ninvestment advisers. Among other things, the\nproposal would expand the current custody rule\nto apply to additional advisory activities and\nall client assets held in advisory accounts.\nInvestment advisers with custody of client\nassets would be required to maintain them with\na qualified custodian and enter into a written\nagreement and receive certain assurances from\nthe qualified custodian regarding custodial\nprotections. Qualified custodians would be\nrequired to hold client cash off-balance\nsheet, potentially reducing the liquidity\navailable for bank lending and other\nactivities. The SEC also has proposed rules\nand rule changes that would impose new\nobligations on registered broker-dealers and\nregistered investment advisers with respect to\ncybersecurity and safeguarding of customer\ninformation, as well as mandatory swing\npricing of mutual fund shares and a hard close\nfor transacting in fund shares that would\nfundamentally change current industry\npractices.\n\nIn March 2023, the CFPB finalized its rule to\nimplement small business data collection under\nSection 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final\nrule introduces substantial data collection\nand reporting requirements for small business\nlenders, including PNC Bank, in connection\nwith credit applications by small businesses,\nwhich impose significant compliance and\noperational risks and costs.

Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2022 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2022\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments and\nestimated recoveries. Our determination of the\nACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future conditions and\nother relevant factors. We use methods\nsensitive to changes in economic conditions to\ninterpret these factors and to estimate\nexpected credit losses. We evaluate and, when\nappropriate, enhance the quality of our data\nand models and other methods used to estimate\nthe ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate\nqualitative factors in the ACL that reflect\nour best estimate of expected losses that may\nnot be adequately represented in our\nquantitative methods or economic assumptions.\nThe major drivers of ACL estimates include,\nbut are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Change to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder the CECL standard, we are required to\nconsider reasonable and supportable forecasts\nin estimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose, we have established a framework that\nincludes a three-year forecast period and the\nuse of four economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes. Credit losses estimated in our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period are\nsensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented to RAC for\napproval, and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios\u2019 weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended March\n31, 2023 reflect an increase in downside risk\ncompared to December 31, 2022. The current\noutlook considers ongoing inflationary\npressures, along with the projected impacts of\nthe recent stress on the banking industry. Our\nmost-likely expectation at March 31, 2023 is\nthat the U.S. economy will be impacted by a\nmild recession in the second half of the year.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate.

Growth then drops narrowly to\n0.3% in 2024, before jumping to 1.9% in 2025.\nIn line with stronger-than-anticipated job\ngrowth at the start of 2023, the weighted-\naverage projection of the unemployment rate is\nexpected to end 2023 at 4.1%, down from the\n4.9% assumed at December 31, 2022. In line\nwith the slowing in overall economic activity,\nthe weighted average unemployment rate is\nexpected to increase throughout 2023 and 2024,\npeaking at 5.0% by year-end 2024, and\ngradually improving to 4.4% by the fourth\nquarter of 2025.\n\nThe current state of the economy reflects an\nenvironment with receding COVID-19 related\nrisks, but heightened uncertainty remains due\nto structural and secular changes fostered by\nthe pandemic for certain sectors of the\neconomy combined with inflation, rising\ninterest rates and ongoing labor-related\nsupply chain pressures. As such, for both our\ncommercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC\nidentified and performed significant analysis\naround segments impacted by such uncertainties\nto ensure our reserves are adequate, given our\ncurrent macroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nappropriately reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nSee the following for additional details

Note 1 Accounting Policies regarding the\nimpact of new accounting pronouncements that\nwe have adopted.\n\nI NTERNAL C ONTROLS A ND D ISCLOSURE C ONTROLS\nA ND P ROCEDURES\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, we performed an\nevaluation under the supervision of and with\nthe participation of our management, including\nthe Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and the Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and of changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nBased on that evaluation, our Chairman,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and our\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)\nwere effective as of March 31, 2023, and that\nthere has been no change in PNC\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the first quarter of 2023 that has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting.\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d

expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 A continuation of recent turmoil in the\nbanking industry, responsive measures to\nmitigate and manage it and related supervisory\nand regulatory actions and costs,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The economy continues to expand in the first\nhalf of 2023, but economic growth is slowing\nin response to the ongoing Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy tightening to slow inflation.\nThis has led to large increases in both short-\nand long-term interest rates. With much higher\nmortgage rates the housing market is already\nin contraction, with steep drops in existing\nhome sales and single-family housing starts,\nand a modest decline in house prices. Other\nsectors where interest rates play an outsized\nrole, such as business investment and consumer\nspending on durable goods, will contract over\n2023.\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline outlook is for a recession\nstarting in the second half of 2023, with real\nGDP contracting less than 1% before recovery\nstarts in the first half of 2024 as the\nFederal Reserve lowers interest rates in\nresponse to a deteriorating labor market and\nslower inflation. The unemployment rate will\nincrease throughout 2023, peaking at above 5%\nin the second half of 2024. Inflation will\nslow with the recession and be back to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective by\nmid-2024.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points in May. This\nwould bring the federal funds rate to a range\nof 5.00% to 5.25% by early-May. PNC expects a\nfederal funds rate cut of 25 basis points in\nearly 2024 as inflation moves toward the\nFOMC\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, our\nfinancial performance, the scope and terms of\nfinal capital regulations then in effect and\nmanagement actions affecting the composition\nof PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In addition, PNC\u2019s\nability to determine, evaluate and forecast\nregulatory capital ratios, and to take actions\n(such as capital distributions) based on\nactual or forecasted capital ratios, will be\ndependent at least in part on the development,\nvalidation and regulatory review of related\nmodels and the reliability of and risks\nresulting from extensive use of such models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations, and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices, and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 41\nwell as risks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2022 Form 10-K\nand subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

corporate and\ninstitutional banking and asset management,\nproviding many of our products and services\nnationally. Our retail branch network is\nlocated coast-to-coast. We also have strategic\ninternational offices in fourcountries outside\nthe U.S.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  1 A                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING P OLICIES                         \n                                              \nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of the parent company and its\nsubsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned,\ncertain partnership interests and VIEs.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2022 Form 10-K. These interim consolidated\nfinancial statements serve to update our 2022\nForm 10-K and may not include all information\nand Notes necessary to constitute a complete\nset of financial statements. There have been\nchanges to certain of our accounting policies\nas disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K due to the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASU\n2022-02). The updated policies impacted by\nthis adoption are included in this Note 1 in\nthe first quarter of 2023. Reference is made\nto Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form\n10-K for a detailed description of all other\nsignificant accounting policies.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. See Note 3\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information on how COVID-19\nhardship related loan modification\ndelinquencies are reported as of March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method over the\ncontractual life. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method,\nover the contractual life of the loan. The\nprocessing fee received for loans originated\nthrough PPP lending under the CARES Act is\ndeferred and accreted into Net interest income\nusing the effective yield method, over the\ncontractual life of the loan. Loans under the\nfair value option are reported at their fair\nvalue, with any changes to fair value reported\nas Noninterest income on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement, and are excluded from the\nmeasurement of ALLL.\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination ( i.e. , PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe acquisition date. PNC considers a variety\nof factors in connection with the\nidentification of more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality, including but\nnot limited to nonperforming status,\ndelinquency, risk ratings and other\nqualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that are attributable, at least in\npart, to credit quality are recognized through\na charge to the provision for credit losses\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nare recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL .\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, or when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to measure the loan at the estimated\nfair value of collateral (less costs to sell\nif sale or foreclosure of the property is\nexpected).\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable.\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02,\nwhich eliminates the accounting guidance for\nTDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2022 Form 10-K for a description of our\naccounting policies for TDRs that were in\neffect prior to adoption.\nModifications to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty result from our loss\nmitigation activities and include principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment\ndelays, term extensions, or combinations\nthereof. Modified loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty continue to\nbe subject to our existing nonaccrual\npolicies. Expected losses or recoveries on\nloans where modifications have been granted to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nhave been factored into the ALLL estimates for\neach loan class under the methodologies\ndescribed in this Note. Refer to Note 3 Loans\nand Related Allowance for Credit Losses for\nmore information on modifications granted to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and\nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL\nand additional details on the composition of\nour loan portfolio:\n\u2022 Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note 1,\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses section of this\nNote 1,\n\u2022 Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance

generally charge-off commercial (commercial\nand industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well-secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform. For commercial\nloans and leases less than a defined dollar\nthreshold, balances are generally charged-off\nin full after 180 days for loans and 120 days\nfor leases.\n\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell, if\nlower than the amortized cost basis of the\nloan outstanding, when delinquency of the\nloan, combined with other risk factors ( e.g.\n, bankruptcy or lien position), indicates that\nthe loan, or some portion thereof, is\nuncollectible as per our historical\nexperience, or the collateral has been\nrepossessed. We charge-off secured consumer\nloans no later than 180days past due. Most\nconsumer loans and lines of credit, not\nsecured by automobiles or residential real\nestate, are charged-off once they have reached\n120- 180days past due.\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an\n\n50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nadjustment to the ALLL to reflect the\nexpectation of recoveries in an amount greater\nthan previously expected, limited to amounts\npreviously charged-off.\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, depending on\nwhether the accrued interest has been\nincorporated into the ACL estimates, as\ndiscussed in the Accrued Interest section of\nthis Note 1, the accrued and uncollected\ninterest is either reversed through Net\ninterest income (if a CECL reserve is not\nmaintained for accrued interest) or charged-\noff against the allowance (if a CECL reserve\nis maintained for accrued interest), except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged-off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance; payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as fee and interest income. For\ncertain consumer loans, the receipt of\ninterest payments is recognized as interest\nincome on a cash basis. Cash basis income\nrecognition is applied if a loan\u2019s amortized\ncost basis is deemed fully collectible and the\nloan has performed for at least six months.\nFor loans modified due to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, payments\nare applied based upon their contractual terms\nunless the related loan is deemed\nnonperforming. Loans modified due to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally included in nonperforming and\nnonaccrual loans if they are not government\ninsured or guaranteed. However, after a\nreasonable period of time, generally six\nmonths, in which the loan performs under\nmodified terms and meets other performance\nindicators, it is returned to\nperforming/accruing status. This return to\nperforming/accruing status demonstrates that\nthe bank expects to collect all of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nLoan modifications granted to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty resulting\nfrom (i) borrowers that have been discharged\nfrom personal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us, and (ii)\nborrowers that are not currently obligated to\nmake both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms are not returned to\naccrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accrual status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collection of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal are not returned to accrual. When a\nnonperforming loan is returned to accrual\nstatus, it is then considered a performing\nloan.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\nresidential and commercial real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information on\nloan modifications granted to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty,\nnonperforming assets and credit quality\nindicators related to our loan portfolio.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 51\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL is based on historical loss\nexperience, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, equipment finance leases,\nother financial assets and unfunded lending\nrelated commitments, for the estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures as\nof the balance sheet date. The remaining\ncontractual term of assets in scope of CECL is\nestimated considering contractual maturity\ndates, prepayment expectations, utilization or\ndraw expectations and any contractually\nembedded extension options that do not allow\nus to unilaterally cancel the extension\noptions. For products without a fixed\ncontractual maturity date ( e.g ., credit\ncards), we rely on historical payment behavior\nto determine the length of the paydown or\ndefault time period.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long-run\naverage expected losses, where applicable and\n(iii) the long run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term. For\nall assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable.\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, analysis\nfrom PNC economists and management judgment.\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically one to three years, if not\nimmediate.\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio, and\ntherefore do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\nSee the following sections related to loans\nand unfunded lending related commitments for\ndetails about specific methodologies.\n52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan, loan\nsegment or lease. We also consider the impact\nof prepayments and amortization on contractual\nmaturity in our expected loss estimates. We\nuse historical credit loss information,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables for the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\ncoupled with analytical methods, to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan, loan segment or\nlease. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario and\nthe long run average period, and combined to\ngenerate expected loss estimates by scenario.\nThe following matrix provides key credit risk\ncharacteristics that we use to estimate these\nrisk parameters.\n                                              \n  Loan       Probabi\u2026    Loss       Exposure  \n  Class      of

is the period between the\nend of the forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate by loan class. We then add or deduct\nany qualitative components and other\nadjustments, such as individually assessed\nloans, to produce the ALLL. See the\nIndividually Assessed Component and\nQualitative Component discussions that follow\nin this Note 1 for additional information\nabout those adjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes.\nEffective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our\nuse of a discounted cash flow methodology, and\nwe now use a pooled expected loss methodology\nbased upon the quantification of risk\nparameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan\nor loan segment. See Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies in our 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndescription of our use of a discounted cash\nflow methodology prior to January 1, 2023.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold\nare reserved for under a pooled basis.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged-off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nattributable to such risks. The ACL also takes\ninto account factors that may not be directly\nmeasured in the determination of individually\nassessed or pooled reserves. Such qualitative\nfactors may include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities section of Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K and\nthe Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note 1 for additional information on our\nnonaccrual and charge-off policies.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022\nForm 10-K for a description of the accounting\npolicies related to the applicable reserves on\naccrued interest for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023.\n\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition, as the\nestimated expected credit loss of the\noutstanding balance or par value, based on the\nmethodologies described previously for loans\nand securities. In accordance with CECL, the\nallowance recognized at acquisition is added\nto the acquisition date purchase price to\ndetermine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable ( e.g. , unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases.

The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $\n282million and $ 144million, respectively.\nThese amounts are included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 142million for securities\navailable for sale, primarily related to non-\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities\nand $ 6million for securities held to maturity\nat March 31, 2023. The comparable amounts at\nDecember 31, 2022 were $ 142million and $\n7million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held to maturity securities transferred\nfrom available for sale are included in held\nto maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 4.9billion at March 31, 2023\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at March 31,\n2023 included $ 30million of net unsettled\nsales that represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for March 31, 2022 was $\n0.8billion of net unsettled purchases.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At March 31, 2023, the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 148million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2022 was $ 149million.

A variety of solutions\nare offered to borrowers, including loan\nmodifications that may result in principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, term\nextensions, payment delays, or combinations\nthereof.\n\n\u2022 Principal forgiveness includes principal and\naccrued interest forgiveness.\n\n\u2022 Interest rate reductions include\nmodifications where the interest rate is\nreduced and interest is deferred.\n\n\u2022 Term extensions extend the original\ncontractual maturity date of the loan.\n\n\u2022 Payment delays consist of modifications\nwhere we expect to collect contractual amounts\ndue, but that result in a delay in the receipt\nof payments specified under the original loan\nterms. We generally consider payment delays to\nbe insignificant when the delay is three\nmonths or less.\n\n\u2022 We also offer repayment plans for some of\nour credit card and unsecured line of credit\nproducts, which provide for a reduced payment\nand interest rate for a specific period of\ntime.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir obligations to us, and those that enter\ninto trial modifications.\n\nLoan modifications granted to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty exclude\nloans held for sale and loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option. Government\ninsured or guaranteed loans, commercial loans\nwith an appraised value of collateral that\nexceeds the loan value, and loans with\nguarantor support are evaluated for inclusion\nin our disclosed population of loan\nmodifications granted to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty, if the loan\nhas been modified in the current period.

These programs are\nstructurally similar such that the interest\nrate is reduced to a standard rate of 4.99%\nand the minimum payment percentage is adjusted\nto 1.90% of the outstanding balance.

In this program, we convert\nthe borrower\u2019s drawn and unpaid balances into\na fully-amortized repayment plan consisting of\nan interest rate of 4.99% and a minimum\npayment amount of 1.90%. This fully-amortized\nprogram is designed in a manner that allows\nthe drawn and unpaid amounts to be recaptured\nat the end of the 60 months.\n\nAfter we modify a loan, we continue to track\nits performance under its most recent modified\nterms.

Our continuing involvement in the\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, Non-\nagency securitizations and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing,\nrepurchasing previously transferred loans\nunder certain conditions and loss share\narrangements, and, in limited circumstances,\nholding of mortgage-backed securities issued\nby the securitization SPEs.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value.

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 52\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE. In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 52. These loans are\nincluded as part of the credit quality\ndisclosures that we make in Note 3 Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses.\n\nTable 52: Non-Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n                       \u2026               \u2026      \n                       \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n            \u2026          \u2026               \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       \u2026    $  1         \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026            $  \u2026         \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026       \u2026    $  1         \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026            $  \u2026         \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans, investments and other\nassets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net\nof collateral (if applicable).

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.3billion at March\n31, 2023 and $ 3.4billion at December 31,\n2022, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages which are measured at fair value.\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. MSRs are subject to\nchanges in value from actual or expected\nprepayment of the underlying loans and\ndefaults, as well as market driven changes in\ninterest rates. We manage this risk by\neconomically hedging the fair value of MSRs\nwith securities, derivative instruments and\nresale agreements, which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\n72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 5 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 54 and 55. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions:\n\nTable 54: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key

Value Measurement\n\nWe measure certain financial assets and\nliabilities at fair value. Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 15 Fair Value in our 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nFor more information on the valuation\nmethodologies used to measure assets and\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, see Note 15 Fair Value in our 2022 Form\n10-K.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow March 31, 2023,\nwe expect to reclassify net derivative losses\nof $ 1.4billion pretax, or $ 1.0billion after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to March 31, 2023. As\nof March 31, 2023, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail regarding

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting and counterparty credit risk, see\nNote 16 Financial Derivatives in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nTable 76 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The\ntable includes cash collateral held or pledged\nunder legally enforceable master netting\nagreements. The table also includes the fair\nvalue of any securities collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements.

These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet.

Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K (such\nprior disclosure referred to as \u201cPrior\nDisclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters where we\nare able to estimate such possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, as of March 31,\n2023, we estimate that it is reasonably\npossible that we could incur losses in excess\nof related accrued liabilities, if any, in an\naggregate amount less than $ 300million. The\nestimates included in this amount are based on\nour analysis of currently available\ninformation and are subject to significant\njudgment and a variety of assumptions and\nuncertainties. As new information is obtained\nwe may change our estimates. Due to the\ninherent subjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of outcomes of legal\nproceedings, any amounts accrued or included\nin this aggregate amount may not represent the\nultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings\nin question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the matters disclosed, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nIn March 2023, the court of appeals affirmed\nin all material respects the district court\u2019s\napproval of the amended definitive agreement\nentered into by the relevant parties to\nresolve the claims of the class seeking\ndamages in the antitrust lawsuits that have\nbeen consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York under the caption In re\nPayment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-\nDiscount Antitrust Litigation (Master File No.\n1:05-md-1720-MKB-JO).

Also in March 2023, PNC\nnoticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit regarding the final\njudgment entered against PNC.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 95\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices.

Average\nbalances of securities are based on amortized\nhistorical cost (excluding adjustments to fair\nvalue, which are included in other assets).\nAverage balances for certain loans and\nborrowed funds accounted for at fair value are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes\nin fair value recorded in Noninterest income.\n\n(b) Loan fees for the three months ended March\n31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022\nwere $46 million, $42 million and $60 million,\nrespectively.\n\n(c) Interest income calculated as taxable-\nequivalent interest income. To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

The impact of this situation\nhas led to risk of additional stress to other\nfinancial services institutions and the\nfinancial services industry generally as a\nresult of increased lack of confidence in the\nfinancial sector. U.S. and international\nregulators have taken action in an effort to\nstrengthen public confidence in the banking\nsystem, including the creation of a new Bank\nTerm Funding Program and international\ncoordination to enhance the provision of\nliquidity via the standing U.S. dollar\nliquidity swap line arrangements. There can be\nno assurance that these actions will stabilize\nthe financial services industry and financial\nmarkets. While we currently do not anticipate\nliquidity constraints of the kind that caused\ncertain other financial services institutions\nto fail or require external support,\nconstraints on our liquidity could occur as a\nresult of unanticipated deposit withdrawals\nbecause of market distress or our inability to\naccess other sources of liquidity, including\nthrough the capital markets due to unforeseen\nmarket dislocations or interruptions.\nMoreover, some of our customers may become\nless willing to maintain deposits at PNC\nbecause of broader market concerns with the\nlevel of insurance available on those\ndeposits. Our business and our financial\ncondition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected by continued soundness\nconcerns regarding financial institutions\ngenerally and our counterparties specifically\nand limitations resulting from further\ngovernmental action in an effort to stabilize\nor provide additional regulation of the\nfinancial system as well as the impact of\nexcessive deposit withdrawals.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.
