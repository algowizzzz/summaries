(the \u201cCorporation\u201d)\nadopted and approved The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. Executive Severance Plan\n(the \u201cExecutive Severance Plan\u201d), effective as\nof the Effective Date. The Executive Severance\nPlan is designed to provide certain employees\nof the Corporation, including our named\nexecutive officers (\u201cNEOs\u201d), payments and\nbenefits upon specified terminations of\nemployment. Certain terms used in this Current\nReport on Form 8-K are defined in the\nExecutive Severance Plan.\n\nThe Executive Severance Plan was developed in\nconsultation with the Committee\u2019s independent\ncompensation consultant, as the Committee\ndetermined it is typical and appropriate to\nprovide a standardized framework for severance\narrangements that will provide increased\ncertainty for the Covered Executives (as\ndefined below) and the Corporation, as well as\nimportant protections for the Corporation, in\nthe event of a non-change in control\nseverance.\n\nThe Committee will select eligible employees\nof the Corporation to participate in the\nExecutive Severance Plan (the \u201cCovered\nExecutives\u201d). Each of the Company\u2019s currently\nserving NEOs will be a participant in the\nExecutive Severance Plan. The Executive\nSeverance Plan does not supersede, replace,\nnor amend any change in control agreements\nbetween the Company and the Covered\nExecutives, which remain in effect. As a\ncondition to becoming eligible for benefits\nunder the Executive Severance Plan, each\nCovered Executive must enter into a\nparticipation notice and agreement to agree to\nprovide 60 days\u2019 notice in connection with any\nresignation of employment.\n\nIf a Covered Executive (i) is involuntarily\nterminated without Cause (as defined in the\nExecutive Severance Plan) or (ii) resigns for\nGood Reason (as defined in the Executive\nSeverance Plan), then, in general, the\nCorporation will provide the following\nseverance payments and benefits to the Covered\nExecutive, subject to applicable tax\nwithholding and a timely release of claims as\ndescribed in the Executive Severance Plan:\n\n\u2022 The continuation of base salary payments for\n52 weeks (the \u201cBase Salary Continuation\u201d),\npayable in accordance with the Corporation\u2019s\nnormal payroll practice; provided that, upon\nthe death of a Covered Executive, any unpaid\nBase Salary Continuation will be paid in a\nlump sum within 30 days of death;\n\n\u2022 A prorated annual cash incentive award\npayment, calculated at the target level for\nthe year that includes the Notification Date\n(as defined in the Executive Severance Plan)\nand prorated for the number of calendar months\nduring the annual performance period that the\nCovered Executive was employed as such;\n\n\u2022 To the extent an NEO is not retirement-\neligible under existing annual equity awards\non the date of termination of employment, the\ncontinued vesting of any outstanding unvested\nannual equity awards that were granted prior\nto February 1, 2025, which will continue to\nvest and be paid out (i) at the same time and\n(ii) based on the same risk and performance-\nadjusted payout percentages applicable under\nthe terms of the equity award agreements as if\nthe Covered Executive remained employed by the\nCorporation for the entire time or performance\nperiod;\n\n\u2022 A contribution equal to 70% of the cost of\nthe monthly premiums for Consolidated Omnibus\nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (\u201cCOBRA\u201d)\ncoverage for 52 weeks; and\n\n\u2022 Talent transition benefits.\n\nThe foregoing summary is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the Executive\nSeverance Plan, which is attached hereto as\nExhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by\nreference.\n                                              \n  Item 9.01 Financial Statements and          \n  Exhibits.                                   \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits.\n                                              \n            Description                       \n            Executive         Method of       \n            Severance Plan    Filing          \n  Number    dated as of       Furnished       \n  10.1      March 21, 2025    herewith        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n            The cover page                    \n            of this                           \n            Current Report                    \n  104       on Form 8-K,                      \n            formatted as                      \n            an inline                         \n            XBRL.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n                       THE PNC                \n                       FINANCI\u2026               \n                       SERVICES               \n                       GROUP,                 \n                       INC.        /s/        \n           March       (Regist\u2026    Gregory    \n  Date:    27, 2025    By:         H.
