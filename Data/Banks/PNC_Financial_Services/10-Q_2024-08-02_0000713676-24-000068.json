Noninterest-bearing\ndeposit balances decreased primarily driven by\na decline in commercial balances. Interest-\nbearing deposits increased modestly reflecting\nhigher commercial balances, partially offset\nby lower consumer balances.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds decreased to $71.4 billion,\ndue to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset\nby parent company senior debt issuances.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nThe second quarter of 2024 reflected\nrelatively stable credit quality performance.\n\n\u2022 At June 30, 2024 compared to December 31,\n2023:\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion\ndecreased $112 million, or 8%, driven by lower\nconsumer and commercial loan delinquencies.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, totaled $5.4\nbillion and $5.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding.

In the year-to-date comparison, net\ninterest income decreased $529 million, or 7%,\nand net interest margin decreased 23 basis\npoints, as the benefit of higher interest-\nearning asset yields was more than offset by\nincreased funding costs.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $5.9\nbillion, or 4%, compared to the first quarter\nof 2024 reflecting net purchase activity,\nprimarily of U.S. Treasury securities,\npartially offset by portfolio paydowns and\nmaturities. Average investment securities\ndecreased $3.8 billion, or 3%, in the year-to-\ndate comparison as net purchase activity was\nmore than offset by portfolio paydowns and\nmaturities. Average investment securities\nrepresented 28% of average interest-earning\nassets for the second quarter of 2024 compared\nto 26% for the first quarter of 2024, and 27%\nfor the first six months of 2024 compared to\n28% for the first six months of 2023.\n\nAverage loans were stable for the second\nquarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter\nof 2024, and included a modest decline in\nconsumer balances reflecting lower residential\nreal estate and home equity loans. Compared to\nthe first six months of 2023, average loans\ndecreased $4.8 billion, or 1%, primarily due\nto lower average utilization of commercial\nloan commitments. Average loans represented\n63% of average interest-earning assets for\nboth the second and first quarters of 2024,\nand 63% for the first six months of 2024\ncompared to 64% for the first six months of\n2023.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the second quarter of 2024 decreased $7.1\nbillion, or 15%, compared to the first quarter\nof 2024, primarily reflecting net securities\npurchases. In the year-to-date comparison,\naverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nincreased $11.9 billion, or 36%, due to higher\nborrowed funds and lower loan and securities\nbalances, partially offset by lower deposits.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nsecond quarter of 2024 were relatively stable\ncompared to the first quarter of 2024, and\nincluded a modest decline in commercial\nbalances reflecting seasonal declines in\ncorporate deposits. Average interest-bearing\ndeposits increased $7.3 billion, or 2%, in the\nyear-to-date comparison. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits represented 81% of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities for both\nthe second and first quarters of 2024, and 81%\nfor the first six months of 2024 compared to\n83%, for the first six months of 2023.\n\nAverage borrowed funds increased $1.9 billion,\nor 2%, and $12.2 billion, or 19%, in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively.

The increase in the year-\nto-date comparison was primarily due to higher\nmerger and acquisition advisory activity and\nincreased underwriting fees, partially offset\nby lower trading revenue.\n\nCard and cash management revenue increased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2024,\nreflecting seasonally higher consumer\ntransaction volumes and higher treasury\nmanagement product revenue. The increase\ncompared to the first six months of 2023 was\nprimarily due to higher treasury management\nproduct revenue.\n\nLending and deposit services were relatively\nstable in both the quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage decreased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2024,\nprimarily due to lower residential mortgage\nactivity.

See Note 2\nInvestment Securities for additional details\nregarding the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe duration of investment securities was 3.6\nyears and 4.2 years at June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. We estimate\nthat at June 30, 2024 the effective duration\nof investment securities was 3.5 years for an\nimmediate 50 basis points parallel increase in\ninterest rates and 3.6 years for an immediate\n50 basis points parallel decrease in interest\nrates.

Compared to\nDecember 31, 2023, both deposits and borrowed\nfunds declined.\n\nTotal deposits decreased reflecting lower\nconsumer and commercial deposits. Noninterest-\nbearing deposit balances decreased primarily\ndriven by a decline in commercial balances.\nInterest-bearing deposits increased modestly\nreflecting higher commercial balances,\npartially offset by lower consumer balances.\nThis shift in deposit composition contributed\nto an increase in funding costs compared to\nthe first quarter of 2024. Our total brokered\ndeposit balances of $10.5 billion at June 30,\n2024 decreased compared to $11.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, and were significantly\nbelow both our internal and regulatory\nguidelines and limits.\n\nBorrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB\nborrowings, partially offset by parent company\nsenior debt issuances.\n\n12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe level and composition of borrowed funds\nfluctuates over time based on many factors,\nincluding market conditions, capital\nconsiderations, and funding needs, which are\nprimarily driven by changes in loan, deposit\nand investment securities balances. While our\nlargest source of liquidity on a consolidated\nbasis is the customer deposit base generated\nby our banking businesses, we also manage our\nborrowed funds to provide a reliable source of\nliquidity for our banking and other\nactivities, considering our LCR and NSFR\nrequirements and other internal and external\nguidelines and constraints.

six\nmonths of 2024 increased $1.2 billion compared\nto the same period in 2023 primarily due to\nhigher revenue and lower noninterest expense,\nas well as a lower provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits,\npartially offset by declines in average\ndeposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income increased in the\ncomparison, reflecting a gain resulting from\nPNC\u2019s participation in the Visa exchange\nprogram, partially offset by lower card and\ncash management fees.\n\nProvision for credit losses for the first six\nmonths of 2024 reflected the impact of\nportfolio activity and improved macroeconomic\nfactors.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased in the\ncomparison, and included lower personnel\nexpense.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans remained\nrelatively stable in the first six months of\n2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nAverage consumer loans decreased driven by\nlower residential real estate as a result of\npaydowns outpacing new volume, as well as\ncontinued declines in education loans from\nrunoff in the government guaranteed portfolio.\nAverage

We\nhave taken a disciplined approach to pricing,\nfocused on retaining relationship-based\nbalances and executing on targeted deposit\ngrowth and retention strategies aimed at more\nrate-sensitive customers. Our goal with regard\nto deposits is to optimize balances, economics\nand long-term customer growth. In the first\nsix months of 2024, average total deposits\ndecreased compared to the same period in 2023,\nand included the impact of quantitative\ntightening by the Federal Reserve and\nincreased customer spending.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe operate and continue to optimize a coast-\nto-coast network of retail branches and ATMs,\nwhich are complemented by PNC\u2019s suite of\ndigital capabilities.

Owner occupied commercial\nreal estate loans are well-diversified across\nindustries. The comparable amount of owner\noccupied commercial real estate loans at\nDecember 31, 2023 was $9.6 billion.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate loans of $35.5 billion\nas of June 30, 2024 comprised $20.2 billion\nrelated to commercial mortgages on income-\nproducing properties, $9.2 billion of\nintermediate-term financing loans and $6.1\nbillion of real estate construction project\nloans. At December 31, 2023, comparable\namounts were $35.4 billion, $21.0 billion,\n$8.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.\nCommercial real estate primarily consists of\nan investment in land and/or buildings held to\ngenerate income, that income serves as the\nprimary source for the repayment of the loan.\nHowever, for all commercial real estate\nassets, the disposition of the assigned\ncollateral serves as a secondary source of\nrepayment for the loan should the borrower\nexperience cash generation difficulties.\n\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith commercial real estate loans tend to be\ncorrelated to the loan structure, collateral\nlocation and quality, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk.

The portfolio is well\ndiversified geographically across our coast-\nto-coast franchise. Within the office\nportfolio at June 30, 2024, criticized loans\ntotaled 29.3% and nonperforming loans totaled\n11.0%, while delinquencies were 0.1%. As\nmeasured at origination, the weighted average\nLTV for the office portfolio was 59%; however,\nupdated appraisals have increased the weighted\naverage LTV to 69% as of June 30, 2024. While\nLTV is one consideration, our risk assessment\nconsiders a number of factors in assessing the\nchanging conditions affecting the portfolio.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we have established\nreserves of 10.3% against office loans.\n\nThe greatest stress in our office portfolio is\nobserved in multi-tenant office loans, which\nrepresents 55% of the portfolio at June 30,\n2024. Within the multi-tenant classification,\ncriticized levels were 51.9% while\nnonperforming loans totaled 19.7%, accounting\nfor almost all of the nonperforming office\npopulation. The weighted average LTV for\nmulti-tenant is 76% at June 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, commercial real estate charge-\noffs since the beginning of 2023 have\nprimarily been multi-tenant office loans.\nGiven the higher level of stress, this segment\nhas a proportionally higher reserve rate of\n15.5%. The remaining 45% of the office\nportfolio is primarily comprised of single-\ntenant, medical and government tenant\nproperties. This subset of the portfolio is\nperforming considerably better, with\napproximately 1% of the book in the criticized\nand nonperforming loan categories. As of June\n30, 2024, the weighted average LTV of this\nbook is 60%.\n\nPortfolio management efforts remain an\nelevated area of focus for the office\nportfolio, with internal risk ratings\ncompleted for each asset quarterly,\naccelerated reappraisal requirements and\nelevated approval levels for any credit\naction. Refreshed appraisals have updated\nvaluations on nearly all of the criticized\noffice exposure since the beginning of 2023.\nAdditionally, active management efforts\ninclude ongoing performance assessments as\nwell as the review of property, lending and\ncapital markets. Portfolio updates are\ndistributed to senior management weekly.\n\nGiven the ongoing change in this area, we\nexpect additional stress in the office sector,\nand a portion of this stress will bear itself\nout as we work through maturities that will\napproximate 41% through June 30, 2025. Upon\nmaturity, and where the balance is not paid in\nfull, an extension may be granted because\ncontractual extension terms are met;\nalternatively, an extension may be granted\nbased on\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nnegotiated terms, and a portion of these\nextensions may involve the curtailment or\ncharge off of principal. We continue to\nactively manage the portfolio, and we believe\nreserve levels adequately reflect the expected\ncredit losses in the portfolio.\n\nCommercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, our outstanding loan\nbalances in the multifamily portfolio totaled\n$16.5 billion, or 5.1% of total loans, while\nadditional unfunded loan commitments totaled\n$3.1 billion. Although inflationary pressures\nand higher interest rates have impacted\ninternal risk assessments and regulatory\nclassification in this portfolio, we have not\nseen a notable change in loan performance at\nthis time with regards to nonperformance,\ndelinquency or charge-offs. We continue to\nclosely monitor our exposure in this sector.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ju\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  20\u2026    43    %    $  1\u2026     42   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            4\u2026      8      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     2            1\u2026      2      \n  \u2026       976     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    18            8\u2026     19      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  47\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          Ju\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  771                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              73    %              73   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at June 30, 2024.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us.

As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien\nposition and geographic concentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes.

PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the second quarter of 2024.\nFluctuations in our average LCR result from\nchanges to the components of the calculation,\nincluding high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR daily and are required to\nmaintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The\nNSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the\nregulatory minimum requirement throughout the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits decreased to\n$416.4 billion at June 30, 2024 from $421.4\nbillion at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-\nbearing deposit balances decreased primarily\ndriven by a decline in commercial balances.\nInterest-bearing deposits increased modestly\nreflecting higher commercial balances,\npartially offset by lower consumer balances.\nAs of June 30, 2024, uninsured deposits\nrepresented approximately 42% of our total\ndeposit base, which is estimated based on the\nregulatory instructions in the Consolidated\nReports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031.\nThe majority of our uninsured deposits are\nrelated to commercial operating and\nrelationship accounts, which we define as\ncommercial deposit customers who utilize two\nor more PNC products. See the Funding Sources\nportion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nReview and Business Segments Review sections\nof this Financial Review for additional\ninformation on our deposits and related\nstrategies.\n\nWe may also obtain liquidity through various\nforms of funding, including long-term debt\n(senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB\nborrowings) and short-term borrowings\n(securities sold under repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper and other short-term\nborrowings). See the Funding Sources section\nof the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in\nthis Financial Review and Note 7 Borrowed\nFunds in this Report for additional\ninformation related to our borrowings.\n\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, increased due to the\nfollowing activity:\n                                              \n  Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt      \n                                              \n                                         \n  In billions                      2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01               $  31.7        \n  Issuances                   4.2        \n  Calls and maturities       -1.8        \n  Other                      -0.4        \n  June 30                 $  33.7        \n                                         \nAdditionally, certain liquid assets and unused\nborrowing capacity from a number of sources\nare also available to manage our liquidity\nposition. PNC has a contingency funding plan\ndesigned to ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of\nliquidity stress. This plan is designed to\nexamine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides the strategies for\naddressing liquidity needs and responsive\nactions we would consider during liquidity\nstress events, which could include the\nissuance of incremental debt, preferred stock,\nor additional deposit actions, including the\nissuance of brokered CDs. The plan also\naddresses the governance, frequency of\nreporting and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of liquidity stress.\n\nPNC defines our primary contingent liquidity\nsources as cash held at the Federal Reserve\nBank, investment securities and unused\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal\nReserve Bank.

At June 30,\n2024, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or issuing intercompany\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n   Parent Company Liquidity                   \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we manage the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $22.9 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $6.2 billion at June 30, 2024.\nSee Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023\nForm 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Under the parent company\u2019s\n2014 commercial paper program, the parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At June 30, 2024, there\nwere no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nThe following table details parent company\nnote issuances in the second quarter of 2024:\n                                              \n  Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued       \n                                              \n                                              \n  Issuance       Amount         Description   \n  Date                          of Issuance   \n                                $1.75         \n                                billion of    \n                                senior        \n                                fixed-to-fl\u2026  \n                                notes with a  \n                                maturity      \n                                date of May   \n                                14, 2030.     \n                                Interest is   \n                                payable       \n                                semi-annual\u2026  \n                                in arrears    \n                                at a fixed    \n                                rate of       \n                                5.492% per    \n                                annum, on     \n                                May 14 and    \n                                November 14   \n                                of each       \n                                year,         \n                                beginning on  \n                                November 14,  \n                                2024.         \n                                Beginning on  \n                                May 14,       \n                                2029,         \n                                interest is   \n  May 14,        $1.75          payable       \n  2024           billion        quarterly in  \n                                arrears at a  \n                                floating      \n                                rate per      \n                                annum equal   \n                                to            \n                                Compounded    \n                                SOFR          \n                                (determined   \n                                with respect  \n                                to each       \n                                quarterly     \n                                interest      \n                                period using  \n                                the SOFR      \n                                Index as      \n                                described in  \n                                the           \n                                Prospectus    \n                                Supplement),  \n                                plus 1.198%,  \n                                on August     \n                                14, 2029,     \n                                November 14,  \n                                2029,         \n                                February 14,  \n                                2030 and at   \n                                the maturity  \n                                date.         \n                                              \nParent company senior and subordinated debt\ncarrying value totaled $26.0 billion and $24.0\nbillion at June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\n\nSee Note 16 Subsequent Events for details on\nthe parent company\u2019s issuances of $1.0 billion\nof its 5.102% senior fixed-to-floating rate\nnotes that mature on July 23, 2027, and $1.5\nbillion of its 5.401% senior fixed-to-floating\nrate notes that mature on July 23, 2035.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     \n                                              \nWe have contractual obligations representing\nrequired future payments on borrowed funds,\ntime deposits, leases, pension and\npostretirement benefits and purchase\nobligations.

In\nlight of the Federal banking agencies\u2019\nproposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, third quarter 2024 share repurchase\nactivity is expected to approximate recent\nquarterly average share repurchase levels. PNC\ncontinues to evaluate the potential impact of\nthe proposed rules and may adjust share\nrepurchase activity depending on market and\neconomic conditions, as well as other factors.\nBased on the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\n2024 annual stress test, PNC\u2019s SCB for the\nfour-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024\nwill remain at the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.\n\nOn July 2, 2024 the PNC Board of Directors\nraised the quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock to $1.60 per share, an increase of 5\ncents per share. The dividend is payable on\nAugust 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at\nthe close of business July 15, 2024.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n

Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024.

As of the second\nquarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet\ncomposition by the end of year one is\ngenerally consistent with the spot composition\nas of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nDeposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are\nprimarily driven by changes in the Federal\nFunds rate, with the relationship between\ndeposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined\nas deposit beta. We define cumulative deposit\nbeta as the change in deposit rate paid on\ninterest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided\nby the change in the upper level of the stated\nFederal Funds rate range since the first\nquarter of 2022, the start of the current\nrising rate cycle. As of June 30, 2024, PNC\u2019s\ncumulative deposit beta was 45%, an increase\nfrom 39% at June 30, 2023. For interest rate\nrisk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to\nadjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending\non market rate levels as well as other\nfactors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect\nhistorical experience and future expectations.\nOur scenario assumes that deposit betas\nincreased slightly from current levels. Actual\ndeposit rates paid may differ from modeled\nprojections due to variables such as\ncompetition for deposits and customer\nbehavior.\n\nAsset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment\nassumptions for both loan and investment\nportfolios. Mortgage and home equity\nportfolios utilize an industry standard model\nto drive estimated prepayments that increase\nin lower rate environments. Commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios assume static\nconstant prepayment rates that are consistent\nacross rate scenarios, as those portfolios\nhistorically do not exhibit significantly\ndifferent prepayment behaviors based upon the\nlevel of market rates.\n\nImpact of Derivatives : PNC uses interest rate\nderivatives, some of which are forward\nstarting, to hedge floating rate commercial\nloans. PNC had $52.8 billion in receive\nfix/pay float swaps as of June 30, 2024, with\na weighted average duration of 2.2 years and\nan average fixed rate of 3.13%. As of June 30,\n2024 PNC also had collars in place, reflecting\n$12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of\nfloors, that are used to hedge these\ncommercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes\nreceive fix/pay float swaps as a means of\nhedging\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 33\nfixed rate debt, as well as pay fix/receive\nfloat swaps as a means of hedging the\ninvestment securities portfolio.

EVE sensitivity\nto interest rate changes is a complementary\nmetric to NII sensitivity analysis and\nrepresents an estimation of long-term interest\nrate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity\nby measuring the changes in the economic value\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments in response to an instantaneous\n+/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.\nSimilar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we\nincorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan\nprepayment assumptions. These methodologies\nare largely consistent between the EVE and NII\nsensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit\nattrition is a significant contributor to EVE\nsensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected\nbased on a dynamic model developed using long-\nterm historical deposit behavior in addition\nto management assumptions including\naccelerated attrition for pandemic related\nexcess deposits. PNC performs various\nsensitivity analyses to understand the impact\nof faster and slower deposit attrition on our\nrisk metrics, with the results reported to\nALCO.\n\nCompared to the second quarter of 2023, there\nhave been no material changes to our NII\nsensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,\nincluding data sources that drive assumptions\nsetting.\n\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Customer-Related\nTrading Risk\n\nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. VaR is calculated for each of\nthe portfolios that comprise our customer-\nrelated trading activities of which the\nmajority are covered positions as defined by\nthe Market Risk Rule. VaR is computed with\npositions and market risk factors updated\ndaily to ensure each portfolio is operating\nwithin its acceptable limits. See the Market\nRisk Management \u2013 Customer-Related Trading\nRisk section of our 2023 Form 10-K for more\ninformation on our models used to calculate\nVaR and our backtesting process.\n\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $34\nmillion for the six months ended June 30,\n2024, compared to $107 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower derivative client sales\nrevenues, partially offset by higher\nsecurities client sales revenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $2.2\nbillion at both June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. As of June 30, 2024, $2.0 billion was\ninvested directly in a variety of companies\nand $0.2 billion was invested indirectly\nthrough various private equity funds.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PNC\nparticipated in the Visa exchange program,\nallowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1\ncommon shares into 1.8 million of Visa Class\nB-2 common shares and 0.7 million of Visa\nClass C common shares. The Visa Class B-2\ncommon shares remain subject to the same\nrestrictions that were imposed on the Visa\nClass B-1 common shares. Participation in the\nexchange required PNC to agree to a make-whole\nagreement that subjects PNC to the same\nindemnity obligations to Visa as prior to\nparticipation in the exchange program.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a\n$754 million gain related to the Visa Class C\ncommon shares received. Included in our other\nequity investments at June 30, 2024, are Visa\nClass B-2 common shares, which are recorded at\ncost, and Visa Class C common shares that are\nrecorded at fair value. The fair value of our\nremaining Visa Class C common shares was\napproximately $0.2 billion at June 30, 2024.\n\nVisa Class B-2 common shares that we own are\ntransferable only under limited circumstances\nuntil the resolution of the pending\ninterchange litigation or Visa launches\nanother exchange program allowing PNC to\nconvert a portion of its Visa Class B-2 common\nshares into freely transferable Visa Class C\ncommon shares. The estimated value of our\ntotal investment in the Visa Class B-2 common\nshares was approximately $0.7 billion, while\nour cost basis was insignificant.

Under the final\nrule, most banks with $100 billion or more in\nassets, including PNC Bank, are required to\nsubmit full resolution plans on a three-year\ncycle, with interim informational supplements\ndue in off-years. The FDIC may also engage in\ncapabilities testing between full resolution\nplan submissions. The final rule significantly\nexpands the required content elements and adds\nvirtual data room and valuation capabilities\nas significant components of the resolution\nplanning process. The final rule indicates\nthat covered institutions will not be required\nto submit a resolution submission or interim\ninformational supplement until at least 270\ndays from the effective date of October 1,\n2024.\n\nThe OCC has proposed revisions to its recovery\nplanning guidelines that apply to certain\nlarge insured national banks, including PNC\nBank.

Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2023 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected prepayments\nand estimated recoveries. Our determination of\nthe ACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We\nincorporate qualitative factors in the ACL\nthat reflect our best estimate of expected\nlosses that may not be adequately represented\nin our quantitative methods or economic\nassumptions. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to the\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and the timing of peak business\ncycles reflected by the scenarios could\nmaterially affect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio\nvolume and mix could materially affect our\nestimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\n36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework that includes a three-year\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios with associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes. Credit losses\nestimated in our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of the scenarios used and weights\nassigned to them.\n\nTo forecast the distribution of economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then\ngiven an associated probability (weight) to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the forecast period. This\nprocess is informed by current economic\nconditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s RAC. This\napproach seeks to provide a reasonable\nrepresentation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate\nexpected credit losses across a variety of\nloans, securities and other financial assets.\nEach quarter, the scenarios and their\nrespective weights are presented to RAC for\napproval.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended June\n30, 2024 consider, among other factors,\nongoing inflationary pressures and the\ncorresponding tightness of monetary policy and\ncredit availability. Given these factors,\ngrowth is expected to slow from current levels\nstarting in the second half of 2024. While\nrecession risks remain elevated, our most-\nlikely expectation at June 30, 2024 is that\nthe U.S. economy avoids a recession in 2024.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nTable 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                  as of June                  \n                    30, 2024                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. real             1.1%    1.2%    2.2%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.3%    4.9%    4.4%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2023                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n  U.S. real             0.1%    1.5%    2.0%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.5%    4.6%    4.2%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at\n1.1% on a weighted average basis, up from the\n0.1% assumed at December 31, 2023, primarily\ndue to stronger economic activity in 2024 than\nwhat was expected at the end of 2023. Growth\nthen rises to 1.2% in 2025, before jumping to\n2.2% in 2026. The weighted-average\nunemployment rate is expected to end 2024 at\n4.3%, down from the 4.5% assumed at December\n31, 2023. The weighted-average unemployment\nrate is then expected to increase through\n2025, peaking at 4.9% during the second half\nof the year, before gradually improving to\n4.4% by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nThe current state of the economy continues to\nreflect uncertainty due to the foundational\nchange in office demand from the acceptance of\nremote work, combined with inflationary\npressures, interest rate movements and\ndeclining consumer savings and deposit\nbalances. As such, for both our commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and\nperformed significant analyses around segments\nimpacted by such uncertainties to ensure our\nreserves are adequate, given our current\nmacroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment.

We did not adopt any new accounting\nstandards during the first six months of 2024\nthat impacted our financial statements.\n\nI NTERNAL C ONTROLS A ND D ISCLOSURE C ONTROLS\nA ND P ROCEDURES\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we performed an\nevaluation under the supervision of and with\nthe participation of our management, including\nthe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and\nthe Executive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and of changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nBased on that evaluation, our Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were\neffective as of June 30, 2024, and that there\nhas been no change in PNC\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting that occurred during\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nthe second quarter of 2024 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting. These statements are\nbased on our views that:\n\n\u2013 Job and income gains will continue to\nsupport consumer spending growth this year,\nbut PNC\u2019s baseline forecast is for slower\neconomic growth in 2024 as higher interest\nrates remain a drag on the economy.\n\n\u2013 Real GDP growth this year will trend close\nto 2%, and the unemployment rate will increase\nmodestly to above 4% by the end of 2024.\nInflation will continue to slow as wage\npressures abate, gradually moving back to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\n\u2013 With slowing inflation PNC expects two\nfederal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points\neach at the FOMC\u2019s September and December\nmeetings, with the rate ending this year in a\nrange between 4.75% and 5.00%. PNC expects\nmultiple federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as\ninflation continues to ease.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding minimum capital levels, including a\nstress capital buffer established by the\nFederal Reserve Board in connection with the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things,\nPNC\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 39\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K\nand subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior-year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial\ncondition or results of operations. Effective\nfor the second quarter of 2024, we updated our\npolicy to classify Interest-earning deposits\nwith banks as Cash and cash equivalents on the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows when\nreconciling Cash and due from banks and\nrestricted cash.\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements through the date of\nissuance of the consolidated financials.\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2023 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2023 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates, and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto\nwithdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nEffective for the second quarter of 2024, we\nupdated our policy to classify Interest-\nearning deposits with banks as Cash and cash\nequivalents on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows when reconciling Cash and due from\nbanks and restricted cash. We believe this\npresentation enhances the usefulness of\nfinancial reporting because management views\nthese funds as a source of liquidity for\nfuture transactions, while enhancing\ncomparability to align with industry practice.\nThere is no impact to our Consolidated Income\nStatement (including EPS), Consolidated\nStatement of Comprehensive Income,\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, or Consolidated\nStatement of Changes in Equity. All periods\npresented herein reflect this change.\n46 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nTo reflect the change in accounting policy, we\nadjusted the Consolidated Statement of Cash\nFlowsfor the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThis included an adjustment of $ 10.9billion\nfrom Net cash provided (used) by investing\nactivities to Net increase (decrease) in cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash at end of\nperiod.

At June 30, 2024, the allowance for\ninvestment securities was $ 93million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2023 was $ 92million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the methodologies used to\ndetermine the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, AOCI included pretax losses\nof $ 285million from derivatives that hedged\nthe purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 36 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. These securities are\nsegregated between investments that had been\nin a continuous unrealized loss position for\nless than twelve months and twelve months or\nmore, based on the point in time that the fair\nvalue declined below the amortized cost basis.\nAll securities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of June\n30, 2024, we concluded that we do not intend\nto sell and believe we will not be required to\nsell these securities prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis.\nTable 36: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

Amortized cost basis\nis as of the period end date.\n\n(c) Amounts are recorded as charge-offs.\n\nRepayment plans are excluded from Table 46.\nThe terms of these programs, which are offered\nfor certain consumer products, are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Credit card and unsecured lines of credit\n\n\u2022 Short-term programs are granted for periods\nof 6and 12months. These programs are\nstructurally similar such that the interest\nrate is reduced to a standard rate of 4.99%\nand the minimum payment percentage is adjusted\nto 1.90% of the outstanding balance. At the\nend of the 6or 12months, the borrower is\nreturned to the original contractual interest\nrate and minimum payment amount specified in\nthe original lending agreement.\n\n\u2022 Fully-amortized repayment plans are also\ngranted, the most common of which being a\n60month program. In this program, we convert\nthe borrower\u2019s drawn and unpaid balances into\na fully-amortized repayment plan consisting of\nan interest rate of 4.99% and an adjusted\nminimum payment percentage of 1.90% of the\noutstanding balance. This fully-amortized\nprogram is designed in a manner that allows\nthe drawn and unpaid amounts to be recaptured\nat the end of the 60months.\n\n\u2022 Home equity loans and lines of credit\n\n\u2022 Fixed payment plan programs establish a\nmodified monthly payment that is informed by\nthe borrower\u2019s financial situation and the\ncurrent market environment at the time of\nmodification, among other factors. As such, we\nmay change the borrower\u2019s interest rate,\nmodify the term of the loan, and/or defer\npayment to arrive at the modified monthly\npayment. Each of the aforementioned terms may\nincrease or decrease, and may vary from loan\nto loan, based on the individual loan and\nborrower characteristics.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 61\nAfter we modify a loan, we continue to track\nits performance under its most recent modified\nterms.

In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 53.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 55 and 56. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. Changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in another ( e.g.\n, changes in mortgage interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rate estimates,\ncould result in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 67\nThe following tables

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 14 Fair Value in our 2023\nForm 10-K.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nFor more information on the valuation\nmethodologies used to measure assets and\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, see Note 14 Fair Value in our 2023 Form\n10-K.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow June 30, 2024, we\nexpect to reclassify net derivative losses of\n$ 1.1billion pretax, or $ 0.9billion after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to June 30, 2024. As\nof June 30, 2024, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n\n86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail regarding

These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The following table\npresents the aggregate fair value of\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features, the associated\ncollateral posted in the normal course of\nbusiness and the maximum amount of collateral\nwe would be required to post if the credit-\nrisk-related contingent features underlying\nthese agreements had been triggered on June\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTable 78: Credit-Risk Contingent Features\n                                              \n  In               June 30,         December  \n  billions             2024         31, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net                                         \n  derivati\u2026                                   \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n  with         $        4.8    $         4.2  \n  credit-r\u2026                                   \n  continge\u2026                                   \n  features                                    \n  Less:                                       \n  Collater\u2026             1.3              1.0  \n  posted                                      \n  Maximum                                     \n  addition\u2026                                   \n  amount of    $        3.5    $         3.2  \n  collater\u2026                                   \n  exposure                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  13 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 20\nLegal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K (such\nprior disclosure referred to as \u201cPrior\nDisclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters where we\nare able to estimate such possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, as of June 30,\n2024, we estimate that it is reasonably\npossible that we could incur losses in excess\nof related accrued liabilities, if any, in an\naggregate amount less than $ 300million. The\nestimates included in this amount are based on\nour analysis of currently available\ninformation and are subject to significant\njudgment and a variety of assumptions and\nuncertainties. As new information is obtained\nwe may change our estimates. Due to the\ninherent subjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of outcomes of legal\nproceedings, any amounts accrued or included\nin this aggregate amount may not represent the\nultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings\nin question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the Disclosed Matters, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nIn June 2024, the district court denied\npreliminary approval of the settlement\nagreement to resolve the class action seeking\nequitable relief in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Eastern District of New York under the\ncaption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and\nMerchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master\nFile No. 1:05-md-1720-MKB-JAM).\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences. Our practice is to\ncooperate fully with regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations, audits and other\ninquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\nRetail Banking, Corporate & Institutional\nBanking and Asset Management Group:\n\nRetail Banking provides deposit, lending,\nbrokerage, insurance services, investment\nmanagement and cash management products and\nservices to consumer and small business\ncustomers who are serviced through our coast-\nto-coast branch network, digital channels,\nATMs, or through our phone-based customer\ncontact centers.

Lending products include\nresidential mortgages, home equity loans and\nlines of credit, auto loans, credit cards,\neducation loans and personal and small\nbusiness loans and lines of credit. The\nresidential mortgage loans are directly\noriginated within our branch network and\nnationwide, and are typically underwritten to\nagency and/or third-party standards, and\neither sold, servicing retained or held on our\nbalance sheet.

Other earnings declined in both\nthe quarterly and year-to-date comparisons.\nAmounts for the second quarter of 2024 were\ndriven by the residual impacts from FTP due to\nthe interest rate environment, and the loss\nrelated to the repositioning of the investment\nsecurities portfolio, along with the expense\nrelated to a PNC Foundation contribution.\nOther earnings for the first six months of\n2024 also included the additional expense\nrelated to the increase in the FDIC\u2019s expected\nlosses.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal FTP methodology,\nwhich is designed to consider interest rate\nand liquidity risks. Under our methodology,\nassets receive a funding charge while\nliabilities and capital receive a funding\ncredit based on market interest rates, product\ncharacteristics and other factors.\n\nOur transfer pricing framework considers the\napplication of funding curves and\nmethodologies consistently across the balance\nsheet. A residual gain or loss from FTP\noperations is retained within Other. This\nresidual gain or loss is reviewed by\nmanagement quarterly, in accordance with the\ninteragency guidance of the FDIC, Federal\nReserve and OCC.\n\nSegment Allocations\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstandalone basis, and includes expense\nallocations for corporate overhead services\nused by the business segments.\n\nCertain costs are retained within Other.

In\nlight of the Federal banking agencies\u2019\nproposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, third quarter 2024 share repurchase\nactivity is expected to approximate recent\nquarterly average share repurchase levels.
