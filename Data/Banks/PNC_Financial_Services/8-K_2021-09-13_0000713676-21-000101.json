The Statement was filed in\nconnection with an Underwriting Agreement,\ndated as of September 8, 2021 (the\n\u201cUnderwriting Agreement\u201d), among the\nCorporation, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nBofA Securities, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities\nLLC and PNC Capital Markets LLC (collectively,\nthe \u201cUnderwriters\u201d), pursuant to which the\nCorporation agreed to sell to the Underwriters\n1,500,000 depositary shares (the \u201cDepositary\nShares\u201d) each representing a 1/100th ownership\ninterest in a share of the Series T Preferred\nStock. Each holder of a Depositary Share will\nbe entitled to the proportional rights of a\nshare of Series T Preferred Stock represented\nby the Depositary Share.\n\nThe Series T Preferred Stock ranks senior to\nthe Corporation\u2019s common stock, equally with\nthe Corporation\u2019s outstanding Series B, O, P,\nR and S Preferred Stock, and at least equally\nwith each other series of preferred stock the\nCorporation may issue (except for any senior\nsecurities that may be issued with the\nrequisite consent of the holders of the Series\nT Preferred Stock and all parity stock), with\nrespect to payments of dividends and\ndistributions of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up.\n\nUnder the terms of the Series T Preferred\nStock, the ability of the Corporation to pay\ndividends or distributions on, redeem,\npurchase or acquire, or make a liquidation\npayment with respect to its common stock or\nany preferred stock ranking on parity with or\njunior to the Series T Preferred Stock is\nsubject to restrictions in the event that the\nCorporation does not declare dividends on the\nSeries T Preferred Stock for the most recently\ncompleted dividend period, or, in the case of\na liquidation payment, does not pay to holders\nof the Series T Preferred Stock the\nliquidation value of $100,000 per share, plus\nany declared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n\nThe terms of the Series T Preferred Stock are\nmore fully described in the Statement, which\nis included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current\nReport on Form 8\u2013K and is incorporated by\nreference herein.\nItem 5.03 Amendments to Articles of\nIncorporation or By-Laws; Change in Fiscal\nYear.\nOn September 10, 2021, the Corporation filed\nthe Statement with the Secretary of State of\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which became\neffective upon filing, amending its Amended\nand Restated Articles of Incorporation to\nestablish the newly authorized Series T\nPreferred Stock of the Corporation consisting\nof 15,000 authorized shares.\n\nHolders of Series T Preferred Stock will be\nentitled to receive, when, as and if declared\nby the Board of Directors of the Corporation\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) or a duly authorized committee\nof the Board, non-cumulative cash dividends\nbased on the liquidation preference (1) from\nthe original issue date of the Series T\nPreferred Stock to, but excluding, September\n15, 2026 (the \u201cfirst reset date\u201d), at a fixed\nrate per annum of 3.400%, and (2) from and\nincluding the first reset date, during each\nreset period (as defined below), at a rate per\nannum equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury\nrate (as defined in the Statement) as of the\nmost recent reset dividend determination date\n(as defined below) plus a spread of 2.595%. If\ndeclared by the Board or a duly authorized\ncommittee of the Board, dividends will be\npayable on the Series T Preferred Stock\nquarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15,\nSeptember 15 and December 15 of each year,\nbeginning on December 15, 2021. A \u201creset date\u201d\nmeans the first reset date and each date\nfalling on the fifth anniversary of the\npreceding reset date. Reset dates, including\nthe first reset date, will not be adjusted for\nbusiness days. A \u201creset period\u201d means the\nperiod from and including the first reset date\nto, but excluding, the next following reset\ndate and thereafter each period from and\nincluding each reset date to, but excluding,\nthe next following reset date. A \u201creset\ndividend determination date\u201d means, in respect\nof any reset period, the day falling three\nbusiness days prior to the first day of such\nreset period.\n\nThe Series T Preferred Stock has a liquidation\npreference of $100,000 per share, plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of any undeclared dividends.\nLiquidating distributions will be made on the\nSeries T Preferred Stock only to the extent of\nthe Corporation\u2019s assets that are available\nafter satisfaction of all liabilities to\ndepositors and creditors and subject to the\nrights of holders of any security ranking\nsenior to the Series T Preferred Stock, and\npro rata as to the Series T Preferred Stock\nand any other shares of the Corporation\u2019s\nstock ranking equally as to such\ndistributions.\n\nThe Series T Preferred Stock does not have any\nmaturity date. The Series T Preferred Stock is\nredeemable at the Corporation\u2019s option (1) in\nwhole or in part, from time to time, on any\ndividend payment date on or after the first\nreset date, at a redemption price equal to\n$100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per\ndepositary share), plus any declared and\nunpaid dividends, without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends, or (2) in whole but not\nin part, at any time within 90 days following\na regulatory capital treatment event (as\ndefined in the Statement), at a redemption\nprice equal to $100,000 per share (equivalent\nto $1,000 per depositary share), plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends and an amount\nequal to the partial dividend that would have\naccrued from the prior scheduled dividend\npayment date to the redemption date. If the\nCorporation redeems the Series T Preferred\nStock, the depositary will redeem a\nproportionate number of Depositary Shares.\nAccordingly, the Series T Preferred Stock will\nremain outstanding indefinitely, unless and\nuntil the Corporation decides to redeem it.\nThe Series T Preferred Stock has no preemptive\nor conversion rights.\n\nThe Series T Preferred Stock has no voting\nrights except with respect to (1) authorizing,\nincreasing the authorized amount of or issuing\nsenior stock; (2) authorizing adverse changes\nin the terms of the Series T Preferred Stock;\n(3) certain merger events; (4) in the case of\ncertain non-payments of dividend only,\nelecting directors; and (5) as otherwise\nrequired under Pennsylvania law.\n\nThe terms of the Series T Preferred Stock are\nmore fully described in the Statement, which\nis included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current\nReport on Form 8\u2013K and is incorporated by\nreference herein.\n                                              \n  Item 8.01 Other Events.                     \n                                              \nOn September 13, 2021, the Corporation closed\nthe public offering of 1,500,000 Depositary\nShares pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.\nThe Depositary Shares and the Series T\nPreferred Stock have been registered under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, by a\nregistration statement on Form S-3ASR (File\nNo. 333- 228804 ) (the \u201cRegistration\nStatement\u201d).
