The acquired\nportfolio represented approximately $16.0\nbillion in total commitments, including\napproximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at\nthe time of acquisition.\n                                              \n  Workforce Reduction                         \n                                              \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, PNC\nimplemented a workforce reduction that is\nexpected to reduce 2024 personnel expense by\napproximately $325 million, on a pre-tax\nbasis. PNC incurred expenses of $150 million\nin the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection\nwith this workforce reduction.\n    1 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\n                                              \n  FDIC Special Assessment                     \n                                              \nIn November 2023, the FDIC approved a final\nrule to implement a special assessment to\nrecover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund\nassociated with protecting uninsured\ndepositors following the closures of Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. As a result,\nPNC incurred a pre-tax expense of $515 million\nduring the fourth quarter of 2023. In the\nfirst quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an\nadditional pre-tax expense of $130 million\nrelated to the increase in the FDIC\u2019s expected\nlosses. As of September 30, 2024, we have not\nrecorded any further incremental expense\nrelated to recent FDIC assessments.\n                                              \n  Second Quarter 2024 Significant Items       \n                                              \nIn the second quarter of 2024, PNC\nparticipated in the Visa exchange program,\nallowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1\ncommon shares into approximately equal amounts\nof Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class\nC common shares. This conversion event\nresulted in a gain of $754 million related to\nthe Visa Class C common shares received. PNC\nretained the Visa Class B-2 common shares. The\nsecond quarter of 2024 also included Visa\nClass B-2 derivative fair value adjustments of\nnegative $116 million and a $120 million\nexpense related to a PNC Foundation\ncontribution. During the second quarter, PNC\nalso repositioned the investment securities\nportfolio, selling low-yielding investment\nsecurities for net proceeds of $3.8 billion,\nresulting in a loss of $497 million. PNC\nredeployed the full proceeds from the sale\ninto higher-yielding investment securities.\nThe combined impact to pre-tax noninterest\nincome and pre-tax noninterest expense was\n$141 million and $120 million, respectively.\n                                              \n  Hurricanes Helene and Milton                \n                                              \nDuring the last week of September 2024,\nHurricane Helene made landfall in Florida\u2019s\npanhandle, impacting a large region of the\nsoutheastern United States, including the\nsouthern Appalachians. In the second week of\nOctober 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall\non the central west coast of Florida, causing\nwidespread damage across the state. The storms\nresulted in property damage to our customers,\nthe closing or disruption of many businesses,\nincluding some of PNC\u2019s branches and\nfacilities and damage to the community\ninfrastructure. We continue to evaluate the\nimpact to our businesses, and, based on our\nassessments to date, we do not expect these\nstorms to have a material impact on our\noperating results, including credit losses.\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n   Selected Financial Data                    \n

In the year-to-date comparison, net\ninterest income decreased $537 million, or 5%,\nand net interest margin decreased 18 basis\npoints, as the benefit of higher interest-\nearning asset yields was more than offset by\nincreased funding costs.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $1.0\nbillion, or 1%, compared to the second quarter\nof 2024 primarily driven by net purchase\nactivity of U.S. Treasury securities. Average\ninvestment securities decreased $1.7 billion,\nor 1%, in the year-to-date comparison as net\npurchase activity was more than offset by\nportfolio paydowns and maturities. Average\ninvestment securities represented 28% of\naverage interest-earning assets for the third\nand second quarters of 2024, and 27% for the\nfirst nine months of 2024 compared to 28% for\nthe first nine months of 2023.\n\nAverage loans were stable for the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter\nof 2024. Compared to the first nine months of\n2023, average loans decreased $3.1 billion,\nprimarily due to lower average utilization of\ncommercial loan commitments. Average loans\nrepresented 62% of average interest-earning\nassets for the third quarter of 2024 compared\nto 63% for the second quarter of 2024, and 62%\nfor the first nine months of 2024 compared to\n64% for the first nine months of 2023.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.2\nbillion, or 10%, compared to the second\nquarter of 2024, primarily reflecting deposit\ngrowth. In the year-to-date comparison,\naverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nincreased $10.3 billion, or 30%, due to higher\nborrowed funds and lower loan and securities\nbalances, partially offset by lower deposits.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nthird quarter of 2024 increased $5.4 billion,\nor 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2024\nand $8.8 billion, or 3%, in the year-to-date\ncomparison. The increase in both comparisons\nreflected growth in commercial deposits,\npartially offset by a decline in consumer\nbalances. In total, average interest-bearing\ndeposits represented 81% of average interest-\nbearing liabilities for both the third and\nsecond quarters of 2024, and 81% for the first\nnine months of 2024 compared to 83%, for the\nfirst nine months of 2023.\n\nAverage borrowed funds decreased $1.4 billion,\nor 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2024,\nreflecting lower FHLB borrowings, partially\noffset by parent company senior debt\nissuances. Compared to the first nine months\nof 2023, average borrowed funds increased\n$11.0 billion, or 17%, primarily due to parent\ncompany senior debt issuances.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n*- Not Meaningful\n\nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 37% for the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to 39% for the second quarter of\n2024, and 38% for the first nine months of\n2024 compared to 35% for the same period in\n2023.\n\n8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees increased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024,\nreflecting higher average equity markets. The\nincrease in the year-to-date comparison\nreflected the impact of higher average equity\nmarkets as well as higher annuity sales. PNC\u2019s\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nof $214 billion at September 30, 2024\nincreased from $196 billion and $176 billion\nat June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. In both comparisons, the\nincrease was primarily due to higher spot\nequity and fixed income markets.\n\nCapital markets and advisory fees increased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024, and\nincluded higher merger and acquisition\nadvisory activity, increased asset backed\nfinancing revenue and higher underwriting\nfees. The increase in the year-to-date\ncomparison was primarily due to higher merger\nand acquisition advisory activity and\nincreased underwriting fees.\n\nCard and cash management revenue decreased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024\nreflecting the impact of credit card\norigination incentives, partially offset by\nhigher treasury management product revenue.\nThe increase compared to the first nine months\nof 2023 was primarily due to higher treasury\nmanagement product revenue.\n\nLending and deposit services grew in both the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nprimarily due to increased customer activity.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage increased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024 driven\nby higher residential mortgage servicing\nrights valuation, net of economic hedge. The\ndecrease compared to the first nine months of\n2023 was driven by lower residential and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased compared to\nthe second quarter of 2024 reflecting Visa\nderivative fair value adjustments of negative\n$128 million in the third quarter of 2024,\nprimarily related to litigation escrow\nfunding, while the second quarter of 2024\nincluded the benefit of $141 million of\nsignificant items. Compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2023, the increase was driven by the\nbenefit of significant items in the second\nquarter of 2024.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 5: Noninterest Expense                \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest expense decreased compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2024 as increased personnel\ncosts, reflecting higher variable compensation\nrelated to increased business activity, were\nmore than offset by a PNC Foundation\ncontribution expense of $120 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.

We estimate\nthat at September 30, 2024 the effective\nduration of investment securities was 3.3\nyears for an immediate 50 basis points\nparallel increase in interest rates and 3.3\nyears for an immediate 50 basis points\nparallel decrease in interest rates.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2023 for\nthe effective duration of investment\nsecurities were 4.1 years and 4.2 years,\nrespectively.\n\nBased on expected prepayment speeds, the\nweighted-average expected maturity of the\ninvestment securities portfolio was 5.2 years\nand 5.5 years at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nTable 10: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities\nof Mortgage and Asset-Backed Debt Securities\n                                              \n  September 30, 2024                   Years  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Agency residential              6.8         \n  mortgage-backed                             \n  Non-agency residential         10.3         \n  mortgage-backed                             \n  Agency commercial               4.3         \n  mortgage-backed                             \n  Non-agency commercial           0.8         \n  mortgage-backed                             \n  Asset-backed                    2.2         \n                                              \nAdditional information regarding our\ninvestment securities portfolio is included in\nNote 2 Investment Securities and Note 11 Fair\nValue.\n\n12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Funding Sources                             \n                                              \nTable 11: Details of Funding Sources\n                                              \n             S\u2026          D\u2026                   \n             30          31       \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026          2\u2026          2\u2026       $     %     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026        $  \u2026    -7  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    14  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    -2  %  \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    -3  %  \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    18  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026     3  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026     1  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    -\u2026  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    21  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    -\u2026  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    12  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026           \u2026           \u2026    -6  %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026        $  \u2026     \u2014     \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \nDeposits are considered an attractive source\nof funding due to their stability and\nrelatively low cost to fund. Compared to\nDecember 31, 2023, our funding source\ncomposition included lower borrowed funds and\nhigher deposit balances.\n\nTotal deposits increased reflecting higher\ninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by\nlower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-\nbearing deposits increased reflecting higher\ncommercial balances, partially offset by lower\nconsumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit\nbalances decreased due to a decline in both\ncommercial and consumer balances. This shift\nin deposit composition contributed to an\nincrease in funding costs compared to the\nfirst and second quarters of 2024. Our total\nbrokered deposit balances of $10.1 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased compared to $11.0\nbillion at December 31, 2023, and were\nsignificantly below both our internal and\nregulatory guidelines and limits.\n\nBorrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB\nborrowings, partially offset by parent company\nsenior debt issuances.\n\nThe level and composition of borrowed funds\nfluctuates over time based on many factors,\nincluding market conditions, capital\nconsiderations, and funding needs, which are\nprimarily driven by changes in loan, deposit\nand investment securities balances. While our\nlargest source of liquidity on a consolidated\nbasis is the customer deposit base generated\nby our banking businesses, we also manage our\nborrowed funds to provide a reliable source of\nliquidity for our banking and other\nactivities, considering our LCR and NSFR\nrequirements and other internal and external\nguidelines and constraints.

2024 increased $1.3 billion compared\nto the same period in 2023 primarily due to\nhigher revenue and lower noninterest expense.\n\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits,\npartially offset by declines in average\ndeposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income increased in the comparison\nreflecting a gain resulting from PNC\u2019s\nparticipation in the Visa exchange program as\nwell as higher asset management and brokerage\nfees, partially offset by lower card and cash\nmanagement fees.\n\nProvision for credit losses for the first nine\nmonths of 2024 reflected the impact of\nportfolio activity, partially offset by an\nimproved macroeconomic outlook.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased in the\ncomparison and included lower personnel\nexpense.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans remained\nstable in the first nine months of 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023. Average\nconsumer loans decreased driven by lower\nresidential real estate, as a result of\npaydowns outpacing new volume, as well as\ncontinued declines in education loans from\nrunoff in the government guaranteed portfolio.\nAverage commercial loans increased due to\nhigher loan commitment utilization, primarily\nwithin the automobile dealer segment.\n\nOur focus on growing primary customer\nrelationships is at the core of our deposit\nstrategy in Retail Banking, which is based on\nattracting and retaining stable, low-cost\ndeposits as a key funding source for PNC. We\nhave taken a disciplined approach to pricing,\nfocused on retaining relationship-based\nbalances and executing on targeted deposit\ngrowth and retention strategies aimed at more\nrate-sensitive customers. Our goal with regard\nto deposits is to optimize balances, economics\nand long-term customer growth. In the first\nnine months of 2024, average total deposits\ndecreased compared to the same period in 2023,\nand included the impact of quantitative\ntightening by the Federal Reserve and\nincreased customer spending.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses, including\nour recently launched new PNC Cash Unlimited \u00ae\ncredit card.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe operate and continue to optimize a coast-\nto-coast network of retail branches and ATMs,\nwhich are complemented by PNC\u2019s suite of\ndigital capabilities. In February 2024, PNC\nannounced it would be investing nearly $1.0\nbillion, through 2028, to open more than 100\nnew branches in key locations, including\nAustin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, and\nSan Antonio, and to renovate more than 1,200\nexisting locations across the country to\nenhance the customer experience.\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geographies that may exist in our\nportfolio. Our commercial and industrial\nportfolio is well-diversified across\nindustries as shown in the following table\n(based on the North American Industry\nClassification System).\n\nTable 16: Commercial and Industrial Loans by\nIndustry\n                                              \n           Se\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           30,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026    $  30\u2026     17  %    $  28\u2026     16  %  \n  t\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026       29\u2026     16          28\u2026     16     \n  s\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026       28\u2026     16          28\u2026     16     \n  S\u2026       22\u2026     12          21\u2026     12     \n  p\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026       14\u2026      8          16\u2026      9     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       10\u2026      6          9,\u2026      6     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       9,\u2026      5          10\u2026      6     \n  a\u2026                                          \n  t\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       7,\u2026      4          7,\u2026      4     \n  w\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       26\u2026     16          26\u2026     15     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $  17\u2026    100  %    $  17\u2026    100  %  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real\nestate and construction industries.\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nOwner occupied commercial real estate loans\ntotaled $9.4 billion and $9.6 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. These loans are included in\ncommercial and industrial loans as the credit\ndecisioning for servicing these loans is based\non the financial conditions of the owner, not\nthe ability of the collateral to generate\nincome. Owner occupied commercial real estate\nloans are well-diversified across industries.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate loans of $35.1 billion\nas of September 30, 2024 comprised $19.6\nbillion related to commercial mortgages on\nincome-producing properties, $9.9 billion of\nintermediate-term financing loans and $5.6\nbillion of real estate construction project\nloans. At December 31, 2023, comparable\namounts were $35.4 billion, $21.0 billion,\n$8.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.\nCommercial real estate primarily consists of\nan investment in land and/or buildings held to\ngenerate income, that income serves as the\nprimary source for the repayment of the loan.\nHowever, for all commercial real estate\nassets, the disposition of the assigned\ncollateral serves as a secondary source of\nrepayment for the loan should the borrower\nexperience cash generation difficulties.\n\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith commercial real estate loans tend to be\ncorrelated to the loan structure, collateral\nlocation and quality, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk.

The portfolio is well\ndiversified geographically across our coast-\nto-coast franchise. Within the office\nportfolio at September 30, 2024, criticized\nloans totaled 28.9% and nonperforming loans\ntotaled 12.5%, while delinquencies were 0.1%.\nAs measured at origination, the weighted\naverage LTV for the office portfolio was\n58.6%; however, updated appraisals have\nincreased the weighted average LTV inclusive\nof both updated property values and\norigination-derived values to 70.9% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. While LTV is one\nconsideration, our risk assessment considers a\nnumber of factors in assessing the changing\nconditions affecting the portfolio. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we have established\nreserves of 11.3% against office loans.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 23\nThe greatest stress in our office portfolio is\nobserved in multi-tenant office loans, which\nrepresents 54.0% of the portfolio at September\n30, 2024. Within the multi-tenant\nclassification, criticized levels were 50.2%\nwhile nonperforming loans totaled 22.4%,\naccounting for almost all of the nonperforming\noffice population. The weighted average LTV\ninclusive of both updated property values and\norigination-derived values for multi-tenant is\n79.6% at September 30, 2024. Additionally,\ncommercial real estate charge-offs since the\nbeginning of 2023 have primarily been multi-\ntenant office loans. Given the higher level of\nstress, this segment has a proportionally\nhigher reserve rate of 16.0%. The remaining\n46.0% of the office portfolio is primarily\ncomprised of single-tenant, medical and\ngovernment tenant properties. These three\ntenant classifications are performing\nconsiderably better, with approximately 3.6%\nof the book in the criticized loan category\nand 0.6% in the nonperforming loan category.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted average\nLTV inclusive of both updated property values\nand origination-derived values of this book is\n60.2%.\n\nThe office portfolio remains an elevated area\nof focus for portfolio management, with\ninternal risk ratings completed quarterly for\neach asset, accelerated reappraisal\nrequirements and elevated approval levels for\nany credit action. Additionally, active\nmanagement efforts include ongoing performance\nassessments as well as the review of property,\nlending and capital markets. Portfolio updates\nare distributed to senior management weekly.\nCollateral in the office portfolio is\nappraised by qualified, independent third-\nparty state certified appraisers. New loans or\nloans being evaluated for extension or\nmaterial modification are required to be\nappraised. The frequency of reappraisals\noutside of a credit action is based on\nregulatory and internal requirements.\nGenerally, for loans with heightened risk, a\ncadence has been established to obtain updated\nappraisals at least annually. Loans that do\nnot demonstrate a heightened risk are\nmonitored through our ongoing management of\nthe portfolio, including any need for a new\nappraisal. All appraisals are reviewed by\nindependent qualified real estate valuation\npersonnel. For existing office building loans,\nPNC employs the as-is market value from third-\nparty appraisals to calculate LTV.\n\nGiven the ongoing change in this area, we\nexpect additional stress in the office sector,\nand a portion of this stress will bear itself\nout as we work through maturities that will\napproximate 42% through September 30, 2025.\nUpon maturity, and where the balance is not\npaid in full, an extension may be granted\nbecause contractual extension terms are met;\nalternatively, an extension may be granted\nbased on negotiated terms, and a portion of\nthese extensions may involve the curtailment\nor charge off of principal. We continue to\nactively manage the portfolio, and we believe\nreserve levels reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio.\n\nCommercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our outstanding loan\nbalances in the multifamily portfolio totaled\n$16.7 billion, or 5.2% of total loans, while\nadditional unfunded loan commitments totaled\n$2.7 billion. Although inflationary pressures,\nhigher interest rates and elevated supply in\ncertain markets have impacted internal risk\nassessments and regulatory classification in\nthis portfolio, we have not seen a notable\nchange in loan performance at this time with\nregards to nonperformance, delinquency or\ncharge-offs. We continue to closely monitor\nour exposure in this sector.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  20\u2026    43    %    $  1\u2026     42   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            4\u2026      8      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     2            1\u2026      2      \n  \u2026       969     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    17            8\u2026     19      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  46\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  771                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              73    %              73   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at September 30, 2024.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us. We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $42.2 billion at September 30,\n2024, with 46% located in California.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were\n$42.4 billion and 45%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans of $26.0 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 were comprised of $21.0\nbillion of home equity lines of credit and\n$5.0 billion of closed-end home equity\ninstallment loans. At December 31, 2023,\ncomparable amounts were $26.2 billion, $20.6\nbillion and $5.6 billion, respectively. Home\nequity lines of credit are a variable interest\nrate product with fixed rate conversion\noptions available to certain borrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\nobtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. Borrower performance of this\nportfolio is tracked on a monthly basis. We\nalso segment the population into pools based\non product type ( e.g. , home equity loans,\nlegacy brokered home equity loans, home equity\nlines of credit or legacy brokered home equity\nlines of credit) and track the historical\nperformance of any related mortgage loans\nregardless of whether we hold such liens. This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien\nposition and geographic concentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes.

PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the third quarter of 2024.\nFluctuations in our LCR result from changes to\nthe components of the calculation, including\nhigh-quality liquid assets and net cash\noutflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR daily and are required to\nmaintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The\nNSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the\nregulatory minimum requirement throughout the\nthird quarter of 2024.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits increased to\n$424.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from\n$421.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Interest-\nbearing deposits increased reflecting higher\ncommercial balances, partially offset by lower\nconsumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit\nbalances decreased due to a decline in both\ncommercial and consumer balances. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, uninsured deposits\nrepresented approximately 44% of our total\ndeposit base, which is estimated based on the\nregulatory instructions in the Consolidated\nReports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031.\nThe majority of our uninsured deposits are\nrelated to commercial operating and\nrelationship accounts, which we define as\ncommercial deposit customers who utilize two\nor more PNC products. See the Funding Sources\nportion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nReview and Business Segments Review sections\nof this Financial Review for additional\ninformation on our deposits and related\nstrategies.\n\nWe may also obtain liquidity through various\nforms of funding, such as senior notes,\nsubordinated debt, FHLB borrowings, securities\nsold under repurchase agreements, commercial\npaper and other short-term borrowings. See the\nFunding Sources section of the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review in this Financial Review\nand Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report for\nadditional information related to our\nborrowings.\n\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, increased due to the\nfollowing activity:\n                                              \n  Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt      \n                                              \n                                         \n  In billions                      2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01               $  31.7        \n  Issuances                   6.7        \n  Calls and maturities       -2.4        \n  Other                       0.7        \n  September 30            $  36.7        \n                                         \nAdditionally, PNC maintains access to\ncontingent funding sources that include unused\nborrowing capacity and certain liquid assets.\nPNC has a contingency funding plan designed to\nensure that liquidity sources are sufficient\nto meet ongoing obligations and commitments,\nparticularly in the event of liquidity stress.\nThis plan is designed to examine and quantify\nthe organization\u2019s liquidity under various\ninternal liquidity stress scenarios and is\nperiodically tested to assess the plan\u2019s\nreliability. Additionally, the plan provides\nthe strategies for addressing liquidity needs\nand responsive actions we would consider\nduring liquidity stress events, which could\ninclude the issuance of incremental debt,\npreferred stock, or additional deposit\nactions, including the issuance of brokered\nCDs. The plan also addresses the governance,\nfrequency of reporting and the\nresponsibilities of key departments in the\nevent of liquidity stress.\n\nPNC defines our primary contingent liquidity\nsources as cash held at the Federal Reserve\nBank, investment securities and unused\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal\nReserve Bank.

At September 30,\n2024, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or issuing intercompany\nsenior unsecured notes.\n\nSee Note 16 Subsequent Events for additional\ninformation on the October 22, 2024\nannouncement of the November 4, 2024\nredemption of all outstanding $0.2 billion\nsenior floating rate bank notes due on\nDecember 2, 2024.\n                                              \n   Parent Company Liquidity                   \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we manage the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $26.4 billion.\nParent company liquidity is held in\nintercompany cash and investments. For\ninvestments with longer durations, the related\nmaturities are aligned with scheduled cash\nneeds, such as the maturity of parent company\ndebt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $6.8 billion at September 30,\n2024. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our\n2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper.

Fourth quarter 2024 share\nrepurchase activity is expected to approximate\nrecent quarterly average share repurchase\nlevels. PNC may adjust share repurchase\nactivity depending on market and economic\nconditions, as well as other factors.

Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024.

To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and\na Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios.

As of the third\nquarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet\ncomposition by the end of year one is\ngenerally consistent with the spot composition\nas of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDeposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are\nprimarily driven by changes in the Federal\nFunds rate. PNC\u2019s deposit beta was 32% for\nSeptember 2024. We define deposit beta as the\nchange in deposit rate paid on total interest-\nbearing deposits divided by the change in the\nupper level of the average stated Federal\nFunds rate range since August 2024, the start\nof the current easing rate cycle. For rate\nsensitivity purposes, PNC assumes the\ncumulative deposit beta will increase from the\ncurrent level. Prior to the beginning of the\neasing cycle, PNC\u2019s beta calculation\nrepresented the change in deposit rate paid on\ninterest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided\nby the change in the upper level of the stated\nFederal Funds rate since the first quarter of\n2022, the start of the rising rate cycle. For\ninterest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic\nbeta models to adjust assumed repricing\nsensitivity depending on market rate levels as\nwell as other factors. The dynamic beta\nassumptions reflect historical experience and\nfuture expectations. Actual deposit rates paid\nmay differ from modeled projections due to\nvariables such as competition for deposits and\ncustomer behavior.\n\nAsset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment\nassumptions for both loan and investment\nportfolios. Mortgage and home equity\nportfolios utilize an industry standard model\nto drive estimated prepayments that increase\nin lower rate environments. Commercial and\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 35\nother consumer loan portfolios assume static\nconstant prepayment rates that are consistent\nacross rate scenarios, as those portfolios\nhistorically do not exhibit significantly\ndifferent prepayment behaviors based upon the\nlevel of market rates.\n\nImpact of Derivatives : PNC uses interest rate\nderivatives, some of which are forward\nstarting, to hedge floating rate commercial\nloans. PNC had $48.8 billion in receive\nfix/pay float swaps as of September 30, 2024,\nwith a weighted average duration of 2.45 years\nand an average fixed rate of 3.44%. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, PNC also had collars in\nplace, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and\n$12.5 billion of floors, that are used to\nhedge these commercial loans. Additionally,\nPNC utilizes receive fix/pay float swaps as a\nmeans of hedging fixed rate debt, as well as\npay fix/receive float swaps as a means of\nhedging the investment securities portfolio.\nSee Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this\nReport for additional information on how we\nuse derivatives to hedge commercial loans,\ninvestment securities and fixed rate debt.\n\nEVE sensitivity results for the third quarters\nof 2024 and 2023 follow:\n                                              \n   Table 32: Economic Value of Equity         \n   Sensitivity Analysis                       \n                                              \n                                              \n                    Third           Third     \n                  Quarter         Quarter     \n                     2024            2023     \n  Economic                                    \n  Value of                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  Sensitiv\u2026                                   \n  Simulati\u2026                                   \n  200 basis                                   \n  point              -4.2  %         -7.0  %  \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  increase                                    \n  200 basis                                   \n  point              -4.1  %          0.8  %  \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  decrease                                    \n                                              \nEVE measures the present value of all\nprojected future cash flows associated with a\npoint-in-time balance sheet and does not\ninclude projected new volume. EVE sensitivity\nto interest rate changes is a complementary\nmetric to NII sensitivity analysis and\nrepresents an estimation of long-term interest\nrate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity\nby measuring the changes in the economic value\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments in response to an instantaneous\n+/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.\nSimilar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we\nincorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan\nprepayment assumptions. These methodologies\nare largely consistent between the EVE and NII\nsensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit\nattrition is a significant contributor to EVE\nsensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected\nbased on a dynamic model developed using long-\nterm historical deposit behavior in addition\nto management assumptions including\naccelerated attrition for pandemic related\nexcess deposits. PNC performs various\nsensitivity analyses to understand the impact\nof faster and slower deposit attrition on our\nrisk metrics, with the results reported to\nALCO.\n\nCompared to the third quarter of 2023, there\nhave been no material changes to our NII\nsensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,\nincluding data sources that drive assumptions\nsetting.\n\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Customer-Related\nTrading Risk\n\nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. VaR is calculated for each of\nthe portfolios that comprise our customer-\nrelated trading activities of which the\nmajority are covered positions as defined by\nthe Market Risk Rule.

Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $2.3\nbillion and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $2.1 billion was invested\ndirectly in a variety of companies, and $0.2\nbillion was invested indirectly through\nvarious private equity funds.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PNC\nparticipated in the Visa exchange program,\nallowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1\ncommon shares into approximately equal amounts\nof Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class\nC common shares. This conversion event\nresulted in a gain of $754 million related to\nthe Visa Class C common shares received. PNC\nretained the Visa Class B-2 common shares. The\nVisa Class B-2 common shares, which are\nincluded in our other equity investments at\ncost, remain subject to the same restrictions\nthat were imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common\nshares. Participation in the exchange required\nPNC to agree to a make-whole agreement that\nsubjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations\nto Visa as prior to participation in the\nexchange program.\n\nThe Visa Class B-2 common shares that we own\nare transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until the resolution of the\npending interchange litigation or Visa\nlaunches another exchange program allowing PNC\nto convert a portion of its Visa Class B-2\ncommon shares into freely transferable Visa\nClass C common shares. At September 30, 2024,\nthe estimated value of our total investment in\nthe Visa Class B-2 common shares was\napproximately $0.7 billion, while our cost\nbasis was insignificant.

Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket risk (primarily interest rate) and\ncredit risk inherent in our business\nactivities. We also enter into derivatives\nwith customers to facilitate their risk\nmanagement activities.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15\nFinancial Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K\nand in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12\nFinancial Derivatives in this Report.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 37\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ECENT                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGULATORY                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVELOPMENTS                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Resolution Planning                         \n                                              \nIn August 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC\nfinalized new guidance for holding company\nresolution plans submitted by triennial full\nfilers, such as PNC, under section 165(d) of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing\nregulations. The guidance generally applies\nexpectations from the 2019 resolution plan\nguidance applicable to U.S. GSIBs.

PNC\u2019s next 165(d)\nresolution plan is due October 1, 2025, per an\nextension provided by the Federal Reserve and\nFDIC in finalizing the new guidance.\n                                              \n  Other Regulatory Developments               \n                                              \nOn October 22, 2024, the CFPB issued a final\nrule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequiring certain entities, including PNC\nBank, to, upon request, make available to a\nconsumer or third party authorized by the\nconsumer certain information the entity has\nconcerning a consumer financial product or\nservice covered by the rule. In issuing the\nrule, the CFPB said that the rule will move\nthe U.S. closer to an \u201copen banking\u201d system\nand will let consumers more easily switch\nbanks or other providers. In general, the\nfinal rule requires covered data providers,\nsuch as PNC Bank, to establish a developer\ninterface satisfying specific security and\nother standards, accept data sharing requests\nby third parties authorized by the consumer\nthrough that developer interface and, in\nresponse to such a request, make that data\navailable in electronic form to consumers and\nauthorized third parties, including data\naggregators. PNC Bank will be prohibited from\ncharging fees for maintaining the developer\ninterface or providing access to such data.\nPNC and PNC Bank may also act as authorized\nthird parties receiving data under the rule\nfrom institutions, and the rule places data\nsecurity, authorization, and other obligations\non those third parties, including limitations\non secondary uses of the data received. PNC\nBank must comply with the rule beginning on\nApril 1, 2026, and we are still assessing the\nimpact of this rule.\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nOur consolidated financial statements are\nprepared by applying certain accounting\npolicies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2023 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected prepayments\nand estimated recoveries. Our determination of\nthe ACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We\nincorporate qualitative factors in the ACL\nthat reflect our best estimate of expected\nlosses that may not be adequately represented\nin our quantitative methods or economic\nassumptions. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to the\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and the timing of peak business\ncycles reflected by the scenarios could\nmaterially affect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio\nvolume and mix could materially affect our\nestimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework that includes a three-year\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios with associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes. Credit losses\nestimated in our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of the scenarios used and weights\nassigned to them.\n\nTo forecast the distribution of economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then\ngiven an associated probability (weight) to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the forecast period. This\nprocess is informed by current economic\nconditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s RAC. This\napproach seeks to provide a reasonable\nrepresentation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate\nexpected credit losses across a variety of\nloans, securities and other financial assets.\nEach quarter, the scenarios and their\nrespective weights are presented to RAC for\napproval.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 consider, among other\nfactors, ongoing inflationary pressures and\nthe corresponding tightness of monetary policy\nand credit availability. Given these factors,\ngrowth is expected to slow from current levels\nin the coming quarters. While recession risks\nremain elevated, our most-likely expectation\nat September 30, 2024 is that the U.S. economy\navoids a recession.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nTable 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                   September                  \n                    30, 2024                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. real             1.8%    0.8%    2.2%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.4%    5.1%    4.7%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December\u00a031,                  \n                        2023                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n  U.S. real             0.1%    1.5%    2.0%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.5%    4.6%    4.2%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at\n1.8% on a weighted average basis, up from the\n0.1% assumed at December 31, 2023, primarily\ndue to stronger economic activity in 2024 than\nwhat was expected at the end of 2023. Growth\nthen slows to 0.8% in 2025, before increasing\nto 2.2% in 2026. The weighted-average\nunemployment rate is expected to end 2024 at\n4.4% down slightly from the 4.5% level assumed\nat December 31, 2023. The weighted-average\nunemployment rate is then expected to increase\nmoderately through 2025 before decreasing to\n4.7% by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nThe current state of the economy continues to\nreflect uncertainty due to the fundamental\nchange in office demand from the acceptance of\nremote work, combined with inflationary\npressures, interest rate movements and housing\naffordability. As such, for both our\ncommercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC\nidentified and performed significant analyses\naround segments impacted by such uncertainties\nto ensure our reserves are appropriate, given\nour current macroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment.

We did not adopt any new accounting\nstandards during the first nine months of 2024\nthat impacted our financial statements.\n\nI NTERNAL C ONTROLS A ND D ISCLOSURE C ONTROLS\nA ND P ROCEDURES\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we performed an\nevaluation under the supervision of and with\nthe participation of our management, including\nthe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and\nthe Executive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and of changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nBased on that evaluation, our Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\neffective as of September 30, 2024, and that\nthere has been no change in PNC\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the third quarter of 2024 that has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting.\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting. These statements are\nbased on our views that:\n\n\u2013 Job and income gains will continue to\nsupport consumer spending growth in the near\nterm, but PNC\u2019s baseline forecast is for\nslower economic growth at the end of 2024 and\nin the first half of 2025 as high interest\nrates remain a drag on the economy.\n\n\u2013 Real GDP growth this year will trend close\nto 2%, and the unemployment rate will remain\nsomewhat above 4% through the rest of 2024 and\nin 2025. Inflation will continue to slow as\nwage pressures abate, gradually moving back to\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective.\n\n\u2013 With slowing inflation PNC expects two\nadditional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis\npoints each at the FOMC\u2019s remaining meetings\nin 2024, with the rate ending this year in a\nrange between 4.25% and 4.50%. PNC expects\nseveral federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as\ninflation continues to ease.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding minimum capital levels, including a\nstress capital buffer established by the\nFederal Reserve Board in connection with the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things,\nPNC\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 41\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K\nand subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior-year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial\ncondition or results of operations. Effective\nfor the second quarter of 2024, we updated our\npolicy to classify Interest-earning deposits\nwith banks as Cash and cash equivalents on the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows when\nreconciling Cash and due from banks and\nrestricted cash.\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements through the date of\nissuance of the consolidated financials.\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2023 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2023 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates, and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto\nwithdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nEffective for the second quarter of 2024, we\nupdated our policy to classify Interest-\nearning deposits with banks as Cash and cash\nequivalents on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows when reconciling Cash and due from\nbanks and restricted cash. We believe this\npresentation enhances the usefulness of\nfinancial reporting because management views\nthese funds as a source of liquidity for\nfuture transactions, while enhancing\ncomparability to align with industry practice.\nThere is no impact to our Consolidated Income\nStatement (including EPS), Consolidated\nStatement of Comprehensive Income,\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, or Consolidated\nStatement of Changes in Equity. All periods\npresented herein reflect this change.\n\n48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nTo reflect the change in accounting policy, we\nadjusted the Consolidated Statement of Cash\nFlows for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. This included an adjustment of $\n14.2billion from Net cash provided (used) by\ninvesting activities to Net increase\n(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash at end of period. The $\n14.2billion was comprised of $ 14.2billion\nreported in Net change in Interest-earning\ndeposits with banks and less than $( 0.1)\nbillion reported in Other investing\nactivities, net. Additionally, we included $\n27.3billion of Interest-earning deposits with\nbanks in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash at beginning of period, and $ 41.5billion\nof Interest-earning deposits with banks in\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at\nend of period.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023\nForm 10-K for recently adopted accounting\nstandards.

The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 3.6billion at September 30, 2024\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax. The comparable\namount at December 31, 2023 was $ 4.2billion.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at September\n30, 2024 included $ 952million of net\nunsettled purchases that represent non-cash\ninvesting activity, and accordingly, are not\nreflected on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. The comparable amount for\nSeptember 30, 2023 was $ 28million of net\nunsettled purchases.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 49\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At September 30, 2024, the\nallowance for investment securities was $\n93million and primarily related to non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities in the\navailable for sale portfolio. The comparable\namount at December 31, 2023 was $ 92million.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023\nForm 10-K for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, AOCI included pretax\nlosses of $ 280million from derivatives that\nhedged the purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 36 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. These securities\nare segregated between investments that had\nbeen in a continuous unrealized loss position\nfor less than twelve months and twelve months\nor more, based on the point in time that the\nfair value declined below the amortized cost\nbasis. All securities included in the table\nhave been evaluated to determine if a credit\nloss exists. As part of that assessment, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we concluded that we do\nnot intend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 36: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

These programs are\nstructurally similar such that the interest\nrate is reduced to a standard rate of 4.99%\nand the minimum payment percentage is adjusted\nto 1.90% of the outstanding balance. At the\nend of the 6or 12months, the borrower is\nreturned to the original contractual interest\nrate and minimum payment amount specified in\nthe original lending agreement.\n\n\u2022 Fully-amortized repayment plans are also\ngranted, the most common of which being a\n60month program. In this program, we convert\nthe borrower\u2019s drawn and unpaid balances into\na fully-amortized repayment plan consisting of\nan interest rate of 4.99% and an adjusted\nminimum payment percentage of 1.90% of the\noutstanding balance. This fully-amortized\nprogram is designed in a manner that allows\nthe drawn and unpaid amounts to be recaptured\nat the end of the 60months.\n\n\u2022 Home equity loans and lines of credit\n\n\u2022 Fixed payment plan programs establish a\nmodified monthly payment that is informed by\nthe borrower\u2019s financial situation and the\ncurrent market environment at the time of\nmodification, among other factors. As such, we\nmay change the borrower\u2019s interest rate,\nmodify the term of the loan, and/or defer\npayment to arrive at the modified monthly\npayment. Each of the aforementioned terms may\nincrease or decrease, and may vary from loan\nto loan, based on the individual loan and\nborrower characteristics.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 63\nAfter we modify a loan, we continue to track\nits performance under its most recent modified\nterms.

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 53\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE. In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 53. These loans are\nincluded as part of the credit quality\ndisclosures that we make in Note 3 Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses.\nTable 53: Non-Consolidated VIEs\n                                              \n            \u2026                                 \n            \u2026               \u2026             C\u2026  \n            \u2026               \u2026             V\u2026  \n            \u2026               \u2026             of  \n            \u2026               \u2026             L\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026    \u2026                    \n         \u2026          \u2026    \u2026     $  \u2026    \u2026      \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026          $  \u2026           \n                                              \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026    \u2026                    \n         \u2026          \u2026    \u2026     $  \u2026    \u2026      \n                         \u2026             \u2026      \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026          $  \u2026           \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans, investments and other\nassets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net\nof collateral (if applicable).

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.5billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $ 3.7billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, and consisted of loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential mortgages which are measured at\nfair value.\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. MSRs are subject to\nchanges in value from actual or expected\nprepayment of the underlying loans and\ndefaults, as well as market driven changes in\ninterest rates. We manage this risk by\neconomically hedging the fair value of MSRs\nwith securities, derivative instruments and\nresale agreements, which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 5 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 55 and 56. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. Changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in another ( e.g.\n, changes in mortgage interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rate estimates,\ncould result in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions:\nTable 55: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key Valuation Assumptions\n

Approximately 97% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass at September 30, 2024, with the\nremainder rated as Criticized.

The following table summarizes our\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including instruments\nfor which we have elected the fair value\noption.\n\nTable 66: Fair Value Measurements \u2013 Recurring\nBasis Summary\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Certain investments that are measured at\nfair value using the net asset value per share\n(or its equivalent) practical expedient have\nnot been classified in the fair value\nhierarchy.\n\n(b) Included in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(c) Amounts at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 are presented gross and are not\nreduced by the impact of legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements that allow us to net\npositive and negative positions and cash\ncollateral held or placed with the same\ncounterparty.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow September 30,\n2024, we expect to reclassify net derivative\nlosses of $ 0.5billion pretax, or $ 0.4billion\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to September 30,\n2024. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is ten years.\n\n88 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail

These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The following table\npresents the aggregate fair value of\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features, the associated\ncollateral posted in the normal course of\nbusiness and the maximum amount of collateral\nwe would be required to post if the credit-\nrisk-related contingent features underlying\nthese agreements had been triggered on\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTable 78: Credit-Risk Contingent Features\n                                              \n  In              September         December  \n  billions         30, 2024         31, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net                                         \n  derivati\u2026                                   \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n  with         $        3.1    $         4.2  \n  credit-r\u2026                                   \n  continge\u2026                                   \n  features                                    \n  Less:                                       \n  Collater\u2026             0.9              1.0  \n  posted                                      \n  Maximum                                     \n  addition\u2026                                   \n  amount of    $        2.2    $         3.2  \n  collater\u2026                                   \n  exposure                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  13 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in Note 20 Legal\nProceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K and in Note\n13 Legal Proceedings in our first and second\nquarter 2024 Form 10-Qs (such prior disclosure\nreferred to as \u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For\nDisclosed Matters where we are able to\nestimate such possible losses or ranges of\npossible losses, as of September 30, 2024, we\nestimate that it is reasonably possible that\nwe could incur losses in excess of related\naccrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate\namount less than $ 300million. The estimates\nincluded in this amount are based on our\nanalysis of currently available information\nand are subject to significant judgment and a\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties. As\nnew information is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the Disclosed Matters, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\n92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences. Our practice is to\ncooperate fully with regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations, audits and other\ninquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\nRetail Banking, Corporate & Institutional\nBanking and Asset Management Group:\n\nRetail Banking provides deposit, lending,\nbrokerage, insurance services, investment\nmanagement and cash management products and\nservices to consumer and small business\ncustomers who are serviced through our coast-\nto-coast branch network, digital channels,\nATMs, or through our phone-based customer\ncontact centers.

There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal FTP methodology,\nwhich is designed to consider interest rate\nand liquidity risks. Under our methodology,\nassets receive a funding charge while\nliabilities and capital receive a funding\ncredit based on market interest rates, product\ncharacteristics and other factors.\n\nOur FTP framework considers the application of\nfunding curves and methodologies consistently\nacross the balance sheet. A residual gain or\nloss from FTP operations is retained within\nOther. This residual gain or loss is reviewed\nby management quarterly, in accordance with\nthe interagency guidance of the FDIC, Federal\nReserve and OCC.\n\nSegment Allocations\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstandalone basis, and includes expense\nallocations for corporate overhead services\nused by the business segments.\n\nCertain costs are retained within Other.

The impact of\nfinancial derivatives used in interest rate\nrisk management is included in the interest\nincome/expense and average yields/rates of the\nrelated assets and liabilities. Basis\nadjustments related to hedged items are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities. Average\nbalances of securities are based on amortized\nhistorical cost (excluding adjustments to fair\nvalue, which are included in other assets).\nAverage balances for certain loans and\nborrowed funds accounted for at fair value are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes\nin fair value recorded in Noninterest income.\n\n(b) Loan fees for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were\n$48 million and $47 million, respectively.\nLoan fees for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $139\nmillion and $137 million, respectively.\n\n(c) Interest income calculated as taxable-\nequivalent interest income. To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.
