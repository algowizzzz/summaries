The impact of the provisions was\nphased-in to regulatory capital through\nDecember 31, 2024.\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Income Statement Highlights                 \n                                              \nNet income of $1.5 billion, or $3.51 per\ndiluted common share, for the first quarter of\n2025 decreased $128 million, or 8%, compared\nto $1.6 billion, or $3.77 per diluted common\nshare, for the fourth quarter of 2024, due to\nlower noninterest and net interest income and\na higher provision for credit losses,\npartially offset by lower noninterest\nexpenses.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended March 31, 2025\ncompared to the three months ended December\n31, 2024:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue of $5.5 billion decreased $115\nmillion, or 2%.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income of $3.5 billion\ndecreased $47 million, or 1%, driven by two\nfewer days in the quarter, partially offset by\nthe benefit of lower funding costs and fixed\nrate asset repricing.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 3 basis points\nto 2.78%.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income of $2.0 billion decreased\n$68 million, or 3%, reflecting lower capital\nmarkets and advisory activity and higher\nnegative Visa derivative adjustments. The\nfirst quarter of 2025 included negative $40\nmillion of Visa derivative fair value\nadjustments, primarily related to litigation\nescrow funding, compared to negative $23\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses was $219 million\nin the first quarter of 2025 and was driven by\nnet charge-offs, primarily in our commercial\nand industrial and credit card loan classes,\nand a net increase in the ACL due to changes\nin macroeconomic factors and portfolio\nactivity. The fourth quarter of 2024 included\na provision for credit losses of $156 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense decreased $119 million,\nor 3%, to $3.4 billion, reflecting asset\nimpairments recognized in the fourth quarter\nof $97 million as well as seasonally lower\nother noninterest expense and marketing.\n\nNet income increased $155 million, or 12%,\ncompared to $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted\ncommon share, for the first three months of\n2024 driven by higher net interest and\nnoninterest income, partially offset by a\nhigher provision for credit losses and higher\nnoninterest expenses.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended March 31, 2025\ncompared to the three months ended March 31,\n2024:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $307 million, or 6%,\nto $5.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income increased $212 million,\nor 6%, reflecting the benefit of lower funding\ncosts and the continued repricing of fixed\nrate assets.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 21 basis\npoints.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $95 million, or\n5%, primarily due to higher merger and\nacquisition advisory activity, increased\nunderwriting fees and higher average equity\nmarkets.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses was $219 million\nin the first three months of 2025. The first\nthree months of 2024 included a provision for\ncredit losses of $155 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $53 million,\nor 2%, compared to the first three months of\n2024 as a result of increased business\nactivity, technology investments and higher\nmarketing spend.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nIncome Statement Review section of this\nFinancial Review.\n                                              \n  Balance Sheet Highlights                    \n                                              \nOur balance sheet was well positioned at March\n31, 2025. In comparison to December 31, 2024:\n\n\u2022 Total assets of $554.7 billion decreased\n$5.3 billion, or 1%, reflecting lower balances\nheld with the FRB and lower securities\nbalances, partially offset by higher loans\noutstanding.\n\n\u2022 Total loans of $318.9 billion increased $2.4\nbillion, or 1%.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans increased $3.4\nbillion, or 2%, to $219.6 billion, due to\nhigher utilization of loan commitments and new\nproduction within the commercial and\nindustrial portfolio, partially offset by\nlower commercial real estate loans.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans decreased $1.0 billion,\nor 1%, to $99.3 billion, primarily due to\nlower residential real estate loans, as\npaydowns outpaced originations.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities decreased $2.0\nbillion, or 1%, to $137.8 billion, primarily\ndue to prepayments and maturities of both\navailable-for-sale and held-to-maturity\nsecurities outpacing purchases of available-\nfor-sale securities.\n\n\u2022 Interest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the FRB, decreased $7.0\nbillion, or 18%, to $32.3 billion, driven by\nlower deposits and higher loan balances,\npartially offset by lower securities balances.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits decreased $3.8 billion, or\n1%, to $422.9 billion, primarily due to lower\ninterest-bearing deposits. The decrease in\ninterest-bearing deposits was driven by lower\ncommercial balances and brokered time\ndeposits, partially offset by higher consumer\nbalances.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds decreased $1.0 billion, or\n2%, to $60.7 billion, due to lower FHLB\nadvances, partially offset by parent company\nsenior debt issuances in the first quarter of\n2025.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 3\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nThe first quarter of 2025 reflected solid\ncredit quality performance.\n\n\u2022 At March 31, 2025 compared to December 31,\n2024:\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.4 billion\nincreased $49 million, or 4%, and included\nhigher consumer loan delinquencies, primarily\nrelated to forbearance activity associated\nwith the California wildfires.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, totaled $5.2\nbillion at both March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024. ACL to total loans was 1.64% at both\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets of $2.3 billion were\nstable.\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs of $205 million, or\n0.26% of average loans, in the first quarter\nof 2025 decreased $45 million compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower\ncommercial real estate net loan charge-offs.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Capital and Liquidity Highlights            \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital and liquidity\npositions.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity of $50.7 billion\nat March 31, 2025 increased $2.0 billion\ncompared to December 31, 2024, due to the\nbenefit of net income and an improvement in\nAOCI, partially offset by common dividends\npaid and common share repurchases.\n\n\u2022 In the first quarter of 2025, PNC returned\n$0.8 billion of capital to shareholders,\nincluding $0.6 billion of dividends on common\nshares and $0.2 billion of common share\nrepurchases.\n\n\u2022 On April 3, 2025, the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.60 per share to be paid on May 5,\n2025 to shareholders of record at the close of\nbusiness April 16, 2025.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6% at March\n31, 2025 from 10.5% at December 31, 2024.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB\nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board in\nconnection with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nCCAR process.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 The economic fundamentals remain solid in\nthe spring of 2025. The labor market remains\nstrong, and job and income gains have\nsupported consumer spending growth in early\n2025. However, downside risks have materially\nincreased with recent substantial changes to\nU.S. tariffs and corresponding policy changes\nby U.S. trading partners.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s baseline forecast remains for\ncontinued expansion, but slower economic\ngrowth in 2025 than in 2024. High interest\nrates remain a drag on the economy, consumer\nspending growth will slow to a pace more\nconsistent with household income growth, and\ngovernment\u2019s contribution to economic growth\nwill be smaller.\n\n\u2022 The baseline forecast is for real GDP growth\nof less than 1% in 2025 and between 1% and 2%\nin 2026, with the unemployment rate increasing\nto around 5% over the next year. However, the\nrecent turbulence in trade policy indicates\nthat growth may be significantly weaker than\nin this forecast and the unemployment rate\nhigher. It remains to be seen the extent that\npolicies will be implemented or persist. If\nimplemented as proposed, higher prices will\nweigh on consumers and businesses, and\nretaliatory policy changes will weigh on U.S.\nexports. The large decline in equity prices\nwill also be a drag on consumer spending. The\nlonger the ongoing trade dispute persists, the\ngreater the likelihood of near-term recession.\n\n\u2022 The baseline forecast is for four federal\nfunds rate cuts of 25 basis points each in\n2025, starting in July. This would take the\nfederal funds rate to a range between 3.25%\nand 3.50% at the end of 2025. High inflation\ncould mean less monetary easing than in the\nforecast, but if the economy enters recession\nthe Federal Reserve could cut the federal\nfunds rate more aggressively this year.\n\nConsistent with the forward guidance we\nprovided on April 15, 2025, for the second\nquarter of 2025, compared to the first quarter\nof 2025, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up approximately 1%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be up 1% to 3%,\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income to be $150 million\nto $200 million,\n\n\u2022 Total revenue to be up 1% to 3%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be approximately\n$300 million.\n\nConsistent with the forward guidance we\nprovided on January 16, 2025 and April 15,\n2025, for the full year 2025, compared to the\nfull year of 2024, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Spot loans to be up 2% to 3%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up 6% to 7%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income to be up approximately\n5%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up approximately 6%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be up approximately\n1%, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n19%.\n\nNoninterest income, other noninterest income\nand total revenue guidance does not forecast\nnet securities gains or losses or Visa\nactivity.\n\nWe are unable to provide a meaningful or\naccurate reconciliation of forward-looking\nnon-GAAP measures, without unreasonable\neffort, to their most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measures. This is due to the\ninherent difficulty of forecasting the timing\nand amounts necessary for the reconciliation,\nwhen such amounts are subject to events that\ncannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in\nour Cautionary Statement.

This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nTable 35 Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent\nNet Interest Income (non-GAAP).\n\n(b) Interest income from Interest-earning\ndeposits with banks primarily includes\ninterest earned on our balances held with the\nFRB and is reported as Other interest income\non our Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid and noninterest-bearing\nsources of funding. See Table 34 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis for additional information.\n\nNet interest income decreased $47 million, or\n1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2024,\nand increased $212 million, or 6%, from the\nfirst quarter of 2024. Both comparisons\nreflected the benefit of lower funding costs\nand the continued repricing of fixed rate\nassets. In comparison to the fourth quarter of\n2024, the benefit was more than offset by two\nfewer days in the quarter. Net interest margin\nincreased 3 basis points compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2024, and 21 basis points\ncompared to the first three months of 2024. In\nboth comparisons, the increase was primarily\ndriven by lower funding rates.\n\nAverage investment securities decreased $1.7\nbillion, or 1%, compared to the fourth quarter\nof 2024, reflecting maturities and net\npaydowns of held-to-maturity securities.\nAverage investment securities increased $6.7\nbillion, or 5%, compared to the first three\nmonths of 2024, driven by net purchase\nactivity of available-for-sale securities.\nAverage investment securities represented 28%\nof average interest-earning assets for both\nthe first quarter of 2025 and the fourth\nquarter of 2024, compared to 26% for the first\nquarter of 2024.\n\nAverage loans decreased $2.4 billion, compared\nto the fourth quarter of 2024 and $4.0\nbillion, compared to the first three months of\n2024. In both comparisons the decrease was\nprimarily due to lower commercial real estate\nloans. Average loans represented 63% of\naverage interest-earning assets for the first\nquarter of 2025, compared to 62% for the\nfourth quarter of 2024 and 63% for the first\nquarter of 2024.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the first quarter of 2025 decreased $3.3\nbillion, or 9%, compared to the fourth quarter\nof 2024 and $13.6 billion, or 28%, compared to\nthe first quarter of 2024, primarily due to\nlower brokered time deposits and borrowed\nfunds outstanding.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nfirst quarter of 2025 were stable compared to\nthe fourth quarter of 2024.

Compared to\nDecember 31, 2024, both deposits and borrowed\nfunds declined.\n\nTotal deposits decreased primarily due to\nlower interest-bearing deposits. The decrease\nin interest-bearing deposits was driven by\nlower commercial balances, partially offset by\nhigher consumer balances. This shift in\ndeposit composition contributed to a decrease\nin funding costs compared to the fourth\nquarter of 2024. Our total brokered deposit\nbalances of $5.9 billion at March 31, 2025\ndecreased compared to $7.3 billion at December\n31, 2024, and were significantly below both\nour internal and regulatory guidelines and\nlimits.\n\nBorrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB\nadvances, partially offset by parent company\nsenior debt issuances in the first quarter of\n2025.\n\nThe level and composition of borrowed funds\nfluctuates over time based on many factors,\nincluding market conditions, capital\nconsiderations, and funding needs, which are\nprimarily driven by changes in loan, deposit\nand investment securities balances.

higher\nnoninterest expense, lower noninterest income\nand higher provision for credit losses.\n\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits,\npartially offset by declines in average\ndeposit and loan balances.\n\nNoninterest income decreased in the comparison\ndue to lower residential mortgage revenue and\nhigher negative Visa derivative adjustments\nprimarily related to litigation escrow\nfunding.\n\nProvision for credit losses for the first\nthree months of 2025 was driven by net charge-\noffs and changes in the ACL due to\nmacroeconomic factors and portfolio activity.\n\nNoninterest expense increased in the\ncomparison due to technology investments,\nhigher marketing spend and increased customer\nactivity.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans decreased\nin the first three months of 2025 compared to\nthe same period in 2024. Average consumer\nloans decreased driven by lower residential\nreal estate, as a result of paydowns outpacing\nnew volume, lower credit card loan balances,\nand continued declines in education loans from\nrunoff in the government guaranteed portfolio.\nAverage commercial loans increased due to\nhigher loan commitment utilization, primarily\nwithin the automobile dealer segment.\n\nOur focus on growing primary customer\nrelationships is at the core of our deposit\nstrategy in Retail, which is based on\nattracting and retaining stable, low-cost\ndeposits as a key funding source for PNC. We\nhave taken a disciplined approach to pricing,\nfocused on retaining relationship-based\nbalances and executing on targeted deposit\ngrowth and retention strategies aimed at more\nrate-sensitive customers. Our goal with regard\nto deposits is to optimize balances, economics\nand long-term customer growth. In the first\nthree months of 2025, average total deposits\ndecreased compared to the same period in 2024,\nand included lower brokered time deposits.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses.

Average total deposits increased compared\nto the three months ended March 31, 2024, due\nto growth in interest-bearing deposits,\npartially offset by lower noninterest-bearing\ndeposits. We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nto our deposit strategy in response to\nevolving market conditions, bank funding needs\nand client relationship dynamics.\n                                              \n  Product Revenue                             \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital markets\nand advisory products and services and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, for\ncustomers of all business segments. On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationships\nexist. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services. A discussion of the\nconsolidated revenue from these services\nfollows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nTreasury management revenue is reported in\nnoninterest income and net interest income.\nNoninterest income includes treasury\nmanagement product revenue less earnings\ncredits provided to customers on compensating\ndeposit balances used to pay for products and\nservices. Net interest income includes funding\ncredit from all treasury management customer\ndeposit balances. Compared to the first three\nmonths of 2024, treasury management revenue\nincreased due to wider interest rate spreads\non the value of deposits, higher average\ndeposit balances and higher product revenue.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\n\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\n\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities increased in the comparison\nprimarily due to higher commercial mortgage\nloan servicing income and revenue from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading.

At December 31, 2024, comparable\namounts were $33.6 billion, $19.3 billion,\n$8.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.\nCommercial real estate primarily consists of\nan investment in land and/or buildings held to\ngenerate income, which serves as the primary\nsource for the repayment of the loan. However,\nthe disposition of the assigned collateral\nserves as a secondary source of repayment for\nthe loan should the borrower experience cash\ngeneration difficulties.\n\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith commercial real estate loans tend to be\ncorrelated to the loan structure, collateral\nlocation and quality, project progress and\nbusiness environment.

The portfolio is well\ndiversified geographically across our coast-\nto-coast franchise. Within the office\nportfolio at March 31, 2025, criticized loans\ntotaled 32.6% and nonperforming loans totaled\n12.1%, while delinquencies were 0.0%. As\nmeasured at origination, the weighted average\nLTV for the office portfolio was 59.0%;\nhowever, for those loans that received\nappraisals after March 31, 2024, the weighted\naverage LTV for those loans has increased to\n81.5% as of March 31, 2025. Since April 1,\n2024, PNC received updated appraisals for\n48.4% of the outstanding balance in the office\nportfolio. While LTV is one consideration, our\nrisk assessment considers a number of factors\nin assessing the changing conditions affecting\nthe portfolio. As of March 31, 2025, we have\nestablished reserves of 13.4% against office\nloans.\n\nThe greatest stress in our office portfolio is\nobserved in multi-tenant office loans, which\nrepresents 55.1% of the portfolio at March 31,\n2025. Within the multi-tenant classification,\ncriticized levels were 53.5% while\nnonperforming loans totaled 21.3%, accounting\nfor almost all of the nonperforming office\npopulation. For multi-tenant office loans that\nreceived appraisals after March 31, 2024, the\nweighted average LTV for those loans was 85.2%\nat March 31, 2025. Since April 1, 2024, PNC\nreceived updated appraisals for 72.8% of the\noutstanding balance in the multi-tenant office\nportfolio. Additionally, commercial real\nestate charge-offs since the beginning of 2025\nhave primarily been multi-tenant office loans.\nGiven the higher level of stress, this segment\nhas a proportionally higher reserve rate of\n18.7% as of March 31, 2025. The remaining\n44.9% of the office portfolio is primarily\ncomprised of single-tenant, medical and\ngovernment tenant properties. These three\ntenant classifications are performing\nconsiderably better, with approximately 6.7%\nof the book in the criticized loan category\nand 0.7% in the nonperforming loan category.\nAs of March 31, 2025, the weighted average LTV\ninclusive of both updated property values and\norigination-derived values of this book is\n60.8%.\n\nThe office portfolio remains an elevated area\nof focus for portfolio management with\ninternal risk ratings completed quarterly for\neach asset (except for medical office loans),\naccelerated reappraisal requirements and\nelevated approval levels for any credit\naction. Additionally, active management\nefforts include ongoing performance\nassessments as well as the review of property,\nlending and capital markets. Portfolio updates\nare distributed to senior management weekly.\nCollateral in the office portfolio is\nappraised by qualified, independent third-\nparty state certified real estate appraisers.\nNew loans or loans being evaluated for\nmaterial extensions or modifications are\nrequired to be appraised. The frequency of\nreappraisals outside of a credit action is\nbased on regulatory and internal requirements.\nGenerally, for loans with heightened risk, a\ncadence has been established to obtain updated\nappraisals at least annually to aid in\ndetermining the timing and amount of a charge-\noff, if deemed necessary. Loans that do not\ndemonstrate a heightened risk are\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 21\nmonitored through our ongoing management of\nthe portfolio, including any need for a new\nappraisal. All appraisals are reviewed by\nindependent qualified real estate valuation\npersonnel. For existing office building loans,\nPNC employs the as-is market value from third-\nparty appraisals to calculate LTV.\n\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty in this area, we\nexpect additional stress in the office sector,\nand a portion of this stress will bear itself\nout as we work through maturities that will\napproximate 41.0% through the twelve months\nended March 31, 2026. Upon maturity, and where\nthe balance is not paid in full, an extension\nmay be granted because contractual extension\nterms are met; alternatively, an extension may\nbe granted based on negotiated terms, and a\nportion of these extensions may involve the\ncurtailment or charge off of principal. We\ncontinue to actively manage the portfolio, and\nwe believe reserve levels reflect the expected\ncredit losses in the portfolio.\n\nCommercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, our outstanding loan\nbalances in the multifamily portfolio totaled\n$16.0 billion, or 5.0% of total loans, while\nadditional unfunded loan commitments totaled\n$2.0 billion. Although inflationary pressures,\nhigher interest rates and elevated supply in\ncertain markets have impacted internal risk\nassessments and regulatory classification in\nthis portfolio, we have not seen a notable\nchange in loan performance at this time with\nregards to nonperformance, delinquency or\ncharge-offs. Additionally, the portfolio is\nwell diversified geographically across our\ncoast-to-coast franchise. We continue to\nclosely monitor our exposure in this sector.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  19\u2026    43    %    $  1\u2026     43   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            3\u2026      8      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     2            1\u2026      2      \n  \u2026       951     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    17            8\u2026     18      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  45\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  773                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              72    %              73   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at March 31, 2025.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us. We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $41.3 billion at March 31, 2025,\nwith 46% located in California.

Home equity lines of credit are\na variable interest rate product with fixed\nrate conversion options available to certain\nborrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\nobtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. Borrower performance of this\nportfolio is tracked on a monthly basis. We\nalso segment the population into pools based\non product type ( e.g. , first lien product\nand second lien product) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold such\nliens. This information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes.

PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded\nthe regulatory minimum requirement throughout\nthe first quarter of 2025. Fluctuations in our\nLCR result from changes to the components of\nthe calculation, including high-quality liquid\nassets and net cash outflows, as a result of\nongoing business activity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR daily and are required to\nmaintain a regulatory minimum of 100%.

Total deposits decreased to\n$422.9 billion at March 31, 2025 from $426.7\nbillion at December 31, 2024, primarily due to\nlower interest-bearing deposits. The decrease\nin interest-bearing deposits was driven by\nlower commercial balances and brokered time\ndeposits, partially offset by higher consumer\nbalances. As of March 31, 2025, uninsured\ndeposits represented approximately 44% of our\ntotal deposit base, which is estimated based\non the regulatory instructions in the\nConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income -\nFFIEC 031. The majority of our uninsured\ndeposits are related to commercial operating\nand relationship accounts, which we define as\ncommercial deposit customers who utilize two\nor more PNC products. See the Funding Sources\nsection in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nReview and the Business Segments Review of\nthis Financial Review for additional\ninformation on our deposits and related\nstrategies.\n\nWe may also obtain liquidity through various\nforms of funding, such as senior notes,\nsubordinated debt, FHLB advances, securities\nsold under repurchase agreements, commercial\npaper and other short-term borrowings.

Additionally, the plan provides\nthe strategies for addressing liquidity needs\nand responsive actions we would consider\nduring liquidity stress events, which could\ninclude the issuance of incremental debt,\npreferred stock, or additional deposit\nactions, including the issuance of brokered\ntime deposits. The plan also addresses the\ngovernance, frequency of reporting and the\nresponsibilities of key departments in the\nevent of liquidity stress.\n\nPNC defines our primary contingent liquidity\nsources as cash held at the FRB, investment\nsecurities and unused borrowing capacity at\nthe FHLB and FRB.

Comparable amounts at December 31,\n2024 were $73.3 billion and $22.3 billion,\nrespectively.\n\n(c) Total borrowing capacity with the FRB was\n$78.6 billion at March 31, 2025 and $77.9\nbillion at December 31, 2024. PNC had no\noutstanding borrowings with the FRB at March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Bank Liquidity                              \n                                              \nIn addition to our primary contingent\nliquidity sources, under PNC Bank\u2019s 2014 bank\nnote program, as amended, PNC Bank may from\ntime to time offer up to $40.0 billion\naggregate principal amount outstanding at any\none time of its unsecured senior and\nsubordinated notes with maturity dates more\nthan nine months (in the case of senior notes)\nand five years or more (in the case of\nsubordinated notes) from their date of issue.\nAt March 31, 2025, PNC Bank\u2019s remaining\ncapacity to issue under the program was $33.0\nbillion.\n\nUnder PNC Bank\u2019s 2013 commercial paper\nprogram, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up\nto $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to\nprovide additional liquidity. At March 31,\n2025, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or issuing intercompany\nunsecured notes.\n                                              \n   Parent Company Liquidity                   \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we manage the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt March 31, 2025, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $27.4 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $6.1 billion at March 31, 2025.\nSee Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2024\nForm 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Under the parent company\u2019s\n2014 commercial paper program, the parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At March 31, 2025, there\nwere no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nThe following table details Parent Company\nnote issuances during the first quarter of\n2025:\n

As of the first\nquarter 2025, the projected balance sheet\ncomposition by the end of year one is\ngenerally consistent with the spot composition\nat March 31, 2025.\n\nBalance Sheet Forecast: Our balance sheet\nforecast is based on various assumptions that\ninclude key interest rate risk aspects such as\nloan and deposit growth, as well as mix, and\nis consistent with our guidance.\n\nDeposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are\nprimarily driven by changes in the Federal\nFunds rate. PNC\u2019s cumulative deposit beta was\n51% through March 2025. We define deposit beta\nas the change in deposit rate paid on total\ninterest-bearing deposits divided by the\nchange in the upper level of the average\nstated Federal Funds rate range since August\n2024, the start of the current easing rate\ncycle. For rate sensitivity purposes, PNC\nassumes the cumulative deposit beta will\ndecrease modestly from the current level. For\ninterest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic\nbeta models to adjust assumed repricing\nsensitivity depending on market rate levels as\nwell as other factors. The dynamic beta\nassumptions reflect historical experience as\nwell as future expectations, and are\nperiodically updated to reflect the current\nview of future expectations. Actual deposit\nrates paid may differ from modeled projections\ndue to variables such as competition for\ndeposits and customer behavior.\n\nAsset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment\nassumptions for both loan and investment\nportfolios. Mortgage and home equity\nportfolios utilize an industry standard model\nto drive estimated prepayments that increase\nin lower rate environments. Commercial and\nother consumer loan portfolios assume static\nconstant prepayment rates that are consistent\nacross rate scenarios, as those portfolios\nhistorically do not exhibit significantly\ndifferent prepayment behaviors based upon the\nlevel of market rates.\n\nImpact of Derivatives : As part of our risk\nmanagement strategy, PNC uses interest rate\nderivatives, some of which are forward\nstarting, to hedge floating rate commercial\nloans. PNC had $58.6 billion in active and\nforward starting receive fix / pay float swaps\nas of March 31, 2025, with a weighted average\nduration of 2.5 years and an average fixed\nrate of 3.68%. As of March 31, 2025, PNC also\nhad collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion\nof caps and $12.5 billion of floors, that are\nused to hedge these commercial loans.\nAdditionally, PNC utilizes receive fix / pay\nfloat swaps to hedge fixed rate debt and\ndeposits, as well as pay fix / receive float\nswaps to\n\n32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nhedge the investment securities portfolio. See\nNote 12 Financial Derivatives for additional\ninformation on how we use derivatives to hedge\nthese financial instruments.\n\nCompared to the first quarter of 2024, there\nhave been no material changes to our NII\nsensitivity assumptions, including data\nsources that drive assumptions setting.\n\nEVE sensitivity results for the first quarters\nof 2025 and 2024 follow:\n                                              \n   Table 32: Economic Value of Equity         \n   Sensitivity Analysis                       \n                                              \n                                              \n                    First           First     \n                  Quarter         Quarter     \n                     2025            2024     \n  Economic                                    \n  Value of                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  Sensitiv\u2026                                   \n  Simulati\u2026                                   \n  200 basis                                   \n  point              -2.2  %         -5.7  %  \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  increase                                    \n  200 basis                                   \n  point              -2.9  %         -1.6  %  \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  decrease                                    \n                                              \nEVE measures the present value of all\nprojected future cash flows associated with a\npoint-in-time balance sheet and does not\ninclude projected new volume. EVE sensitivity\nto interest rate changes is a complementary\nmetric to NII sensitivity analysis and\nrepresents an estimation of long-term interest\nrate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity\nby measuring the changes in the economic value\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments in response to an instantaneous\n+/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.\nSimilar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we\nincorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan\nprepayment assumptions. Directionally, higher\ndeposit beta assumptions result in increasing\nliability sensitivity whereas lower deposit\nbetas increase asset sensitivity. Conceptually\nsimilar, higher loan prepayment assumptions\ncause an increase in asset sensitivity and\nlower prepayments result in an increase in\nliability sensitivity. These behavioral\nmodeling assumptions are largely consistent\nbetween the EVE and NII sensitivity analyses,\nand also share the same starting balance sheet\nposition as of March 31, 2025. Deposit\nattrition is also a significant contributor to\nEVE sensitivity. Deposit attrition is\nprojected based on a dynamic model developed\nusing long-term historical deposit behavior in\naddition to management assumptions. PNC\nperforms various sensitivity analyses to\nunderstand the impact of faster and slower\ndeposit attrition, loan prepayments and\ndeposit betas on our risk metrics, with the\nresults reported to ALCO.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, PNC introduced a\nnew deposit runoff model for EVE. Relative to\nthe legacy model, the new deposit model uses\nan improved functional form for capturing rate\nsensitivity and also takes into account more\nrecent deposit behavioral data.\n\nAs a result of the introduction of the new\ndeposit model, PNC's estimated balance sheet\nduration decreased, becoming more neutral. The\nmodel change results in our estimated EVE\nhaving more symmetrical exposure to +200 bps\nand -200 bps shocks, as compared to the prior\nmodel which resulted in our balance sheet\nfacing greater exposure to +200 bps rate shock\nand minimal exposure to a -200 bps rate shock.\n\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Customer-Related\nTrading Risk\n\nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit and funding\nvaluation adjustment related to our customer\nderivatives portfolio are marked-to-market\ndaily and reported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical\n\ncorrelations across different asset classes.\nVaR is computed with positions and market risk\nfactors updated daily to ensure each portfolio\nis operating within its acceptable limits.

Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2024 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2024\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL:\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected prepayments\nand estimated recoveries. Our determination of\nthe ACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 37\nfuture economic conditions and other relevant\nfactors. We use methods sensitive to changes\nin economic conditions to interpret these\nfactors and to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate the ACL on an\nongoing basis. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to the\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and the timing of peak business\ncycles reflected by the scenarios could\nmaterially affect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio\nvolume and mix could materially affect our\nestimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nWe also incorporate qualitative factors in the\nACL that reflect our best estimate of expected\nlosses that may not be adequately represented\nin our quantitative methods or economic\nassumptions, as discussed below and in the\nAllowance for Credit Losses section of Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.\nThrough this approach, we believe the reserve\nlevels appropriately reflect the expected\ncredit losses in the portfolio as of the\nbalance sheet date.\n\nOur methodologies and key assumptions are\nfurther discussed in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies in our 2024 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework that includes a three-year\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios with associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes. Credit losses\nestimated in our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of the scenarios used and weights\nassigned to them.\n\nTo forecast the distribution of economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then\ngiven an associated probability (weight) to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the forecast period. This\nprocess is informed by current economic\nconditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s RAC. This\napproach seeks to provide a reasonable\nrepresentation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate\nexpected credit losses across a variety of\nloans, securities and other financial assets.\nEach quarter, the scenarios and their\nrespective weights are presented to RAC for\napproval.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended March\n31, 2025 consider, among other factors,\nongoing inflationary pressures and the\ncorresponding tightness of monetary policy and\ncredit availability. Given these factors,\ngrowth is expected to slow from current levels\nin the coming quarters. While recession risks\nremain elevated, our most-likely expectation\nat March 31, 2025 is that the U.S. economy\navoids a recession. We believe the economic\nscenarios effectively reflect the distribution\nof potential economic outcomes.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:\n\nTable 36: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                 as of March                  \n                    31, 2025                  \n                        2025    2026    2027  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. real             0.8%    1.8%    2.1%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.7%    4.9%    4.4%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December\u00a031,                  \n                        2024                  \n                        2025    2026    2027  \n  U.S. real             0.7%    2.2%    2.2%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.8%    4.7%    4.4%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2025, 2026 and 2027,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2025 at\n0.8% on a weighted average basis, similar to\nthe 0.7% assumed at December 31, 2024.

Our most significant\nqualitative factor was related to the office\nportfolio of the commercial real estate loan\nclass.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Financial\nReview,\n\n\u2022 Note 2 Investment Securities and Note 3\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nin this Report, and\n\n\u2022 Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2024 Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Recently Issued Accounting Standards        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022 Required                   \n                 with                         \n                 issuance of                  \n                 2025 Form                    \n                 10-K; early                  \n                 adoption is                  \n                 permitted.                   \n                 \u2022 Requires                   \n                 public                       \n                 business                     \n                 entities                     \n                 to, on an                    \n                 annual                       \n                 basis, (1)                   \n                 disclose                     \n                 specific                     \n                 categories                   \n                 in the rate                  \n                 reconcilia\u2026                  \n                 and (2)                      \n                 provide                      \n                 additional     \u2022 We are      \n                 information    currently     \n                 for            evaluating    \n                 reconciling    the           \n                 items that     disclosure    \n                 meet a         requirements  \n                 quantitati\u2026    of this ASU   \n                 threshold.     and do not    \n                 \u2022 Requires     plan to       \n                 that all       early adopt.  \n                 entities       \u2022 This ASU    \n                 disclose,      will not      \n                 on an          impact our    \n                 annual         Consolidated  \n                 basis, (1)     Income        \n                 the amount     Statement,    \n  Improvemen\u2026    of income      Consolidated  \n  to Income      taxes paid     Statement of  \n  Tax            (net of        Comprehensi\u2026  \n  Disclosures    refunds        Income,       \n  -

Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The economic fundamentals remain solid in\nthe spring of 2025. The labor market remains\nstrong, and job and income gains have\nsupported consumer spending growth in early\n2025. However, downside risks have materially\nincreased with recent substantial changes to\nU.S. tariffs and corresponding policy changes\nby U.S. trading partners.\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline forecast remains for\ncontinued expansion, but slower economic\ngrowth in 2025 than in 2024. High interest\nrates remain a drag on the economy, consumer\nspending growth will slow to a pace more\nconsistent with household income growth, and\ngovernment\u2019s contribution to economic growth\nwill be smaller.\n\n\u2013 The baseline forecast is for real GDP growth\nof less than 1% in 2025 and between 1% and 2%\nin 2026, with the unemployment rate increasing\nto around 5% over the next year. However, the\nrecent turbulence in trade policy indicates\nthat growth may be significantly weaker than\nin this forecast and the unemployment rate\nhigher. It remains to be seen the extent that\npolicies will be implemented or persist. If\nimplemented as proposed, higher prices will\nweigh on consumers and businesses, and\nretaliatory policy changes will weigh on U.S.\nexports. The large decline in equity prices\nwill also be a drag on consumer spending. The\nlonger the ongoing trade dispute persists, the\ngreater the likelihood of near-term recession.\n\n\u2013 The baseline forecast is for four federal\nfunds rate cuts of 25 basis points each in\n2025, starting in July. This would take the\nfederal funds rate to a range between 3.25%\nand 3.50% at the end of 2025. High inflation\ncould mean less monetary easing than in the\nforecast, but if the economy enters recession\nthe Federal Reserve could cut the federal\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nfunds rate more aggressively this year.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding minimum capital levels, including a\nstress capital buffer established by the\nFederal Reserve Board in connection with the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things,\nPNC\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2024 Form 10-K\nand elsewhere in this Report, including in the\nRisk Factors and Risk Management sections and\nthe Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes in\nthese reports. Our forward-looking statements\nmay also be subject to other risks and\nuncertainties, including those discussed\nelsewhere in this Report or in our other\nfilings with the SEC.\n The PNC Financial

We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior-year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial\ncondition or results of operations. Effective\nfor the second quarter of 2024, we updated our\npolicy to classify Interest-earning deposits\nwith banks as Cash and cash equivalents on the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows when\nreconciling Cash and due from banks and\nrestricted cash.\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements through the date of\nissuance of the consolidated financials.\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2024 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2024 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2024 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates, and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto\nwithdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nEffective for the second quarter of 2024, we\nupdated our policy to classify Interest-\nearning deposits with banks as Cash and cash\nequivalents on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows when reconciling Cash and due from\nbanks and restricted cash. We believe this\npresentation enhances the usefulness of\nfinancial reporting because management views\nthese funds as a source of liquidity for\nfuture transactions, while enhancing\ncomparability to align with industry practice.\nThere is no impact to our Consolidated Income\nStatement (including earnings per share),\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive\nIncome, Consolidated Balance Sheet, or\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.\nAll periods presented herein reflect this\nchange.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 47\nTo reflect the change in accounting policy, we\nadjusted the Consolidated Statement of Cash\nFlows for the three months ended March 31,\n2024. This included an adjustment of $\n9.8billion from Net cash provided (used) by\ninvesting activities to Net increase\n(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash at end of period. The $\n9.8billion was previously reported in Net\nchange in Interest-earning deposits with\nbanks. Additionally, we included $ 43.8billion\nof Interest-earning deposits with banks in\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at\nbeginning of period, and $ 53.6billion of\nInterest-earning deposits with banks in Cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash at end of\nperiod.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2024\nForm 10-K for recently adopted accounting\nstandards.

The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2024 were $\n242million and $ 328million, respectively.\nThese amounts are included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 63million for securities\navailable-for-sale, primarily related to non-\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities,\nand $ 5million for securities held-to-maturity\nat March 31, 2025. The comparable amounts at\nDecember 31, 2024 were $ 86million and $\n5million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held-to-maturity securities transferred\nfrom available-for-sale are included in held-\nto-maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held-to-\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 3.2billion at March 31, 2025\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax. The comparable\namount at December 31, 2024 was $ 3.4billion.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available-for-sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held-to-maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at March 31,\n2025 included $ 335million of net unsettled\npurchases that represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount at March 31, 2024 was $\n262million of net unsettled purchases.\n\n48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At March 31, 2025, the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 68million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available-\nfor-sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2024 was $ 91million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2024 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the methodologies used to\ndetermine the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nAt March 31, 2025, AOCI included pretax losses\nof $ 271million from derivatives that hedged\nthe purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held-to-maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 38 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available-for-\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024. These securities are\nsegregated between investments that had been\nin a continuous unrealized loss position for\nless than twelve months and twelve months or\nmore, based on the point in time that the fair\nvalue declined below the amortized cost basis.\nAll securities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of\nMarch 31, 2025, we concluded that we do not\nintend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 54\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.6billion at March\n31, 2025 and $ 3.7billion at December 31,\n2024, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages measured at fair value.\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. MSRs are subject to\nchanges in value from actual or expected\nprepayment of the underlying loans and\ndefaults, as well as market driven changes in\ninterest rates. We manage this risk by\neconomically hedging the fair value of MSRs\nwith securities, derivative instruments and\nresale agreements, which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 5 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 56 and 57. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. Changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in another ( e.g.\n, changes in mortgage interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rate estimates,\ncould result in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions:\nTable 56: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key Valuation Assumptions\n

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 14 Fair Value in our 2024\nForm 10-K.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nInterest-bearing Deposits\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, PNC elected to\nbegin accounting for certain brokered time\ndeposits, which are economically hedged with\nderivatives, under the fair value option. The\nelection of the fair value option aligns the\naccounting for the brokered time deposits with\nthe related hedges. Fair value is estimated by\ndiscounting contractual cash flows using\ncurrent market rates for instruments with\nsimilar maturities. The portion of the change\nin fair value attributable to instrument-\nspecific credit risk is recognized in OCI, and\nis estimated as the difference between the\noverall change in fair value and the change in\nfair value resulting from a change in the\nspecified benchmark interest rate. The portion\nof the change in fair value resulting from a\nchange in the specified benchmark interest\nrate is recognized in the Consolidated Income\nStatement within Deposits interest expense.\nBrokered time deposits are classified as Level\n2, as the estimates of current market rates\nused to determine fair value are based on\ndealer indications and benchmark interest\nrates that are considered observable.\n\n70 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nFor more information on the valuation\nmethodologies used to measure assets and\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, see Note 14 Fair Value in our 2024 Form\n10-K.

For more\ninformation on these financial instruments for\nwhich the fair value option election has been\nmade, refer to the Fair Value Measurement\nsection of this Note 11. These financial\ninstruments are initially measured at fair\nvalue. Gains and losses from initial\nmeasurement and any changes in fair value are\nsubsequently recognized in earnings. For\ninterest-bearing deposits, however, any\nchanges in fair value attributable to\ninstrument-specific credit risk are recognized\nin OCI.\n\nInterest income related to changes in the fair\nvalues of these financial instruments is\nrecorded on the Consolidated Income Statement\nin Other interest income, except for certain\nresidential mortgage loans, for which income\nis also recorded in Loans interest income.\nChanges in the value on prepaid forward\ncontracts included in Other assets is reported\nin Noninterest expense, and interest expense\non the Other borrowed funds is reported in\nBorrowed funds interest expense.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow March 31, 2025,\nwe expect to reclassify net derivative losses\nof $ 0.4billion pretax, or $ 0.3billion after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to March 31, 2025. As\nof March 31, 2025, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting and counterparty credit risk, see\nNote 15 Financial Derivatives in our 2024 Form\n10-K.\n\nTable 78 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The\ntable includes cash collateral held or pledged\nunder legally enforceable master netting\nagreements. The table also includes the fair\nvalue of any securities collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Cash and securities\ncollateral amounts are included in the table\nonly to the extent of the related net\nderivative fair values.\n\nTable 78 includes OTC derivatives not settled\nthrough an exchange (\u201cOTC derivatives\u201d) and\nOTC derivatives cleared through a central\nclearing house (\u201cOTC cleared derivatives\u201d).\nOTC derivatives represent contracts executed\nbilaterally with counterparties that are not\nsettled through an organized exchange or\ndirectly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house that then becomes our\ncounterparty. OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 83\nTable 78: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt March 31, 2025, cash and debt securities\n(primarily agency mortgage-backed securities)\ntotaling $ 2.1billion were pledged to us under\nmaster netting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements, and we pledged\ncash and debt securities (primarily agency\nmortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n2.4billion under these agreements to\ncollateralize net derivative liabilities owed\nto counterparties and to meet initial margin\nrequirements. These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\n84 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The following table\npresents the aggregate fair value of\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features, the associated\ncollateral posted in the normal course of\nbusiness and the maximum amount of collateral\nwe would be required to post if the credit-\nrisk-related contingent features underlying\nthese agreements had been triggered on March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:\nTable 79: Credit-Risk Contingent Features\n                                              \n  In               March 31,        December  \n  billions              2025        31, 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net                                         \n  derivati\u2026                                   \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n  with         $         3.2    $        3.9  \n  credit-r\u2026                                   \n  continge\u2026                                   \n  features                                    \n  Less:                                       \n  Collater\u2026              1.1             1.1  \n  posted                                      \n  Maximum                                     \n  addition\u2026                                   \n  amount of    $         2.1    $        2.8  \n  collater\u2026                                   \n  exposure                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  13 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in Note 20 Legal\nProceedings in our 2024 Form 10-K (such prior\ndisclosure referred to as \u201cPrior\nDisclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters where we\nare able to estimate such possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, as of March 31,\n2025, we estimate that it is reasonably\npossible that we could incur losses in excess\nof related accrued liabilities, if any, in an\naggregate amount less than $ 300million. The\nestimates included in this amount are based on\nour analysis of currently available\ninformation and are subject to significant\njudgment and a variety of assumptions and\nuncertainties. As new information is obtained\nwe may change our estimates. Due to the\ninherent subjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of outcomes of legal\nproceedings, any amounts accrued or included\nin this aggregate amount may not represent the\nultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings\nin question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2024 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the Disclosed Matters, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences. Our practice is to\ncooperate fully with regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations, audits and other\ninquiries.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 85\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nThe following disclosures reflect the adoption\nof ASU 2023-07, see Note 1 Accounting Policies\nin our 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation related to our adoption of this\nASU.\n\nWe have threereportable business segments:\nRetail Banking, Corporate & Institutional\nBanking and the Asset Management Group. Our\nreportable business segments are defined by\nthe nature of products and services, types of\ncustomers, methods used to distribute products\nor provide services and similar financial\nperformance. Results of our reportable\nbusiness segments are regularly reviewed by\nthe CODM, our Chief Executive Officer.\nSpecifically, the CODM reviews actual and\nforecasted quarterly financial reporting\nresults, including net income, to assess\nperformance and allocate resources\naccordingly. However, the CODM may use other\nmetrics on an ad hoc basis as warranted.\n\nThe following describes the products and\nservices of each business segment:\n\nRetail Banking provides deposit, lending,\nbrokerage, insurance services, investment\nmanagement and cash management products and\nservices to consumer and small business\ncustomers who are serviced through our coast-\nto-coast branch network, digital channels,\nATMs, or through our phone-based customer\ncontact centers. Deposit products include\nchecking, savings and money market accounts\nand time deposits. Lending products include\nresidential mortgages, home equity loans and\nlines of credit, auto loans, credit cards,\neducation loans and personal and small\nbusiness loans and lines of credit. The\nresidential mortgage loans are directly\noriginated within our branch network and\nnationwide, and are typically underwritten to\nagency and/or third-party standards, and\neither sold, servicing retained or held on our\nbalance sheet. Brokerage, investment\nmanagement and cash management products and\nservices include managed, education,\nretirement and trust accounts.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking provides\nlending, treasury management, capital markets\nand advisory products and services to mid-\nsized and large corporations and government\nand not-for-profit entities. Lending products\ninclude secured and unsecured loans, letters\nof credit and equipment leases. The Treasury\nManagement business provides corporations with\ncash and investment management services,\nreceivables and disbursement management\nservices, funds transfer services and access\nto online/mobile information management and\nreporting services. Capital markets and\nadvisory includes services and activities\nprimarily related to merger and acquisitions\nadvisory, equity capital markets advisory,\nasset-backed financing, loan syndication,\nsecurities underwriting and customer-related\ntrading. We also provide commercial loan\nservicing and technology solutions for the\ncommercial real estate finance industry.\nProducts and services are provided nationally.\n\nAsset Management Group provides private\nbanking for high net worth and ultra high net\nworth clients and institutional asset\nmanagement. The Asset Management group is\ncomposed of twooperating units:\n\n\u2022 PNC Private Bank provides products and\nservices to emerging affluent, high net worth\nand ultra high net worth individuals and their\nfamilies including investment and retirement\nplanning, customized investment management,\ncredit and cash management solutions, trust\nmanagement and administration. In addition,\nmulti-generational family planning services\nare also provided to ultra high net worth\nindividuals and their families, which include\nestate, financial, tax, fiduciary and\ncustomized performance reporting through PNC\nPrivate Bank Hawthorn.\n\n\u2022 Institutional Asset Management provides\noutsourced chief investment officer, custody,\ncash and fixed income client solutions and\nretirement plan fiduciary investment services\nto institutional clients including\ncorporations, healthcare systems, insurance\ncompanies, unions, municipalities and non-\nprofits.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of\n\n86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nnew methodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal FTP methodology,\nwhich is designed to consider interest rate\nand liquidity risks. Under our methodology,\nassets receive a funding charge while\nliabilities and capital receive a funding\ncredit based on market interest rates, product\ncharacteristics and other factors.\n\nOur FTP framework considers the application of\nfunding curves and methodologies consistently\nacross the balance sheet. A residual gain or\nloss from FTP operations is not allocated to\nour reportable business segments.
