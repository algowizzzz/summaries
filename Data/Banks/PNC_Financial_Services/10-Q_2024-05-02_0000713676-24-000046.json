              \nNet income of $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per\ndiluted common share, for the first quarter of\n2024 increased $461 million, or 52%, compared\nto $0.9 billion, or $1.85 per diluted common\nshare, for the fourth quarter of 2023, due to\nlower noninterest expense and a lower\nprovision for credit losses, partially offset\nby lower net interest and noninterest income.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended March 31, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended December\n31, 2023:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue decreased $216 million, or 4%,\nto $5.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income of $3.3 billion\ndecreased $139 million, or 4%, primarily due\nto increased funding costs, lower loan\nbalances and one fewer day in the quarter.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin declined 9 basis points\nto 2.57%, primarily as a result of higher\nfunding costs.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $77 million, or\n4%, primarily due to lower capital markets and\nadvisory activity and seasonal declines in\ncard and cash management fees. The first\nquarter also included negative Visa Class B-1\nderivative fair value adjustments of $7\nmillion. Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value\nadjustments were negative $100 million in the\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses of $155 million\nin the first quarter of 2024 reflected\nportfolio activity and improved macroeconomic\nfactors. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a\nprovision for credit losses of $232 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense decreased $740 million,\nor 18%, to $3.3 billion, driven by lower or\nstable expenses across all categories,\nreflecting a continued focus on expense\nmanagement. The first quarter of 2024 included\nan additional pre-tax expense of $130 million\nrelated to the increase in the FDIC\u2019s expected\nlosses. The fourth quarter of 2023 included\n$515 million pertaining to the FDIC special\nassessment as well as $150 million of\nworkforce reduction charges.\n\nNet income decreased $350 million, or 21%,\ncompared to $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted\ncommon share, for the first quarter of 2023\ndriven by lower net interest and noninterest\nincome, partially offset by a lower provision\nfor credit losses.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended March 31, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended March 31,\n2023:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue decreased $458 million, or 8%,\nto $5.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income decreased $321 million,\nor 9%, as the benefit of higher interest-\nearning asset yields was more than offset by\nincreased funding costs.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin decreased 27 basis\npoints, primarily as a result of higher\nfunding costs.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $137 million,\nor 7%, and included a decline in private\nequity revenue and residential and commercial\nmortgage revenue, partially offset by growth\nin card and cash management and asset\nmanagement and brokerage fees.

In comparison to\nDecember 31, 2023:\n\n\u2022 Total assets of $566.2 billion increased\nmodestly primarily due to higher balances held\nwith the Federal Reserve Bank, partially\noffset by lower securities and loan balances.\n\n\u2022 Total loans decreased $1.7 billion, or 1%,\nto $319.8 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans decreased $0.7\nbillion, to $218.8 billion, driven by paydowns\noutpacing new production and lower utilization\nof loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans declined $1.0 billion\nto $100.9 billion, as paydowns outpaced new\noriginations and draws on existing accounts.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities decreased $2.1\nbillion, or 2%, to $130.5 billion, primarily\ndue to prepayments and maturities outpacing\npurchases.\n\n\u2022 Interest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the Federal Reserve Bank,\nincreased $9.8 billion, or 22%, to $53.6\nbillion, primarily due to an increase in\ndeposits and a decrease in securities and\nloans balances.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits increased $4.2 billion, to\n$425.6 billion, reflecting higher commercial\nand consumer deposits. Noninterest-bearing\ndeposit balances decreased driven by a decline\nin commercial noninterest-bearing balances.\nInterest-bearing deposits increased reflecting\nhigher commercial and consumer interest-\nbearing balances.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds were largely stable at $72.7\nbillion, as parent company senior debt\nissuances were offset by lower FHLB\nborrowings.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nThe first quarter of 2024 reflected stable\ncredit quality performance.\n\n\u2022 At March 31, 2024 compared to December 31,\n2023:\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion\ndecreased $109 million, or 8%, driven by lower\nconsumer and commercial loan delinquencies.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, totaled $5.4\nbillion and $5.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. During the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024, this\nreserve was driven by improved macroeconomic\nfactors as well as portfolio activity. ACL to\ntotal loans was 1.68% and 1.70% at March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets increased $199 million,\nor 9%, to $2.4 billion, primarily due to\nhigher commercial real estate nonperforming\nloans.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs of $243 million, or 0.30% of\naverage loans, in the first quarter of 2024\nincreased $43 million compared to the fourth\nquarter of 2023 primarily due to higher\ncommercial net loan charge-offs.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Capital and Liquidity Highlights            \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital and liquidity\npositions.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity of $45.1 billion\nat March 31, 2024, increased $0.2 billion,\ncompared to December 31, 2023 due to the\nbenefit of net income, partially offset by\ncommon dividends paid, a decline in AOCI and\ncommon share repurchases.\n\n\u2022 In the first quarter of 2024, PNC returned\n$0.8 billion of capital to shareholders,\nreflecting more than $0.6 billion of dividends\non common shares and more than $0.1 billion of\ncommon share repurchases, representing 0.9\nmillion shares.\n\n\u2022 Consistent with the SCB framework, which\nallows for capital return in amounts in excess\nof the SCB minimum levels, our Board of\nDirectors has authorized a repurchase\nframework under the previously approved\nrepurchase program of up to 100 million common\nshares, of which approximately 44% were still\navailable for repurchase at March 31, 2024. In\nlight of the Federal banking agencies proposed\nrules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, second quarter 2024 share\nrepurchase activity is expected to approximate\nrecent quarterly average share repurchase\nlevels. PNC continues to evaluate the\npotential impact of the proposed rules and may\nadjust share repurchase activity depending on\nmarket and economic conditions, as well as\nother factors. PNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter\nperiod beginning October 1, 2023 is the\nregulatory minimum of 2.5%.\n\n\u2022 On April 3, 2024, the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.55 per share to be paid on May 6,\n2024 to shareholders of record at the close of\nbusiness April 15, 2024.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.1% at March\n31, 2024 from 9.9% at December 31, 2023.\n\n\u2022 PNC elected a five-year transition provision\neffective March 31, 2020 to delay through\nDecember 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL\nstandard on regulatory capital, followed by a\nthree-year transition period.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting. These statements are\nbased on our views that:\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s baseline forecast is for slower\neconomic growth in 2024 as consumer spending\ngrowth slows and higher interest rates remain\na drag on the economy. The ongoing strength of\nthe labor market will continue to support\nconsumer spending. The FOMC is indicating that\nit will start to cut the federal funds rate\nlater this year, with rate cuts supporting\neconomic growth toward the end of 2024.\n\n\u2022 Real GDP growth this year will be close to\nits trend of 2% and the unemployment rate will\nincrease modestly to just above 4% by the end\nof 2024. Inflation will continue to slow as\nwage pressures abate, moving back to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective by\nthe end of 2025.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain\nunchanged between 5.25% and 5.50% through at\nleast the first half of 2024, with federal\nfunds rate cuts starting in the third quarter\nas inflationary pressures ease further. PNC\nexpects two federal funds rate cuts in 2024,\nwith the rate ending this year in a range\nbetween 4.75% and 5.00%.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, compared to\nthe first quarter of 2024, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down approximately\n1%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be up 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income to be $150 million\nto $200 million,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be stable,\n\n\u2022 Core noninterest expense to be up 2% to 4%,\nand\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be $225 million to\n$275 million.\n\nFor the full year 2024, compared to the full\nyear of 2023, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up approximately 1%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down 4% to 5%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income to be up 4% to 6%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be stable to down 2%,\n\n\u2022 Core noninterest expense to be stable, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n18.5%.\n\nCore noninterest expense guidance excludes an\nadditional pre-tax expense of $130 million\nrelated to the increase in the FDIC\u2019s expected\nlosses in the first quarter of 2024, and $515\nmillion pertaining to the FDIC special\nassessment as well as $150 million of\nworkforce reduction charges incurred in the\nfourth quarter of 2023. See the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) \u2013 Reconciliation of\nCore Noninterest Expense (non-GAAP) section of\nthis Report.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\n(b) Interest income from Interest-earning\ndeposits with banks primarily includes\ninterest earned on our balances held with the\nFederal Reserve Bank and is reported as Other\ninterest income on our Consolidated Income\nStatement.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income decreased $139 million, or\n4%, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to\nincreased funding costs, lower loan balances\nand one fewer day in the quarter. Net interest\nincome decreased $321 million, or 9%, for the\nfirst three months of 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023, as the benefit of higher\ninterest-earning asset yields was more than\noffset by increased funding costs. Net\ninterest margin declined 9 basis points\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and 27\nbasis points compared to the first quarter of\n2023, primarily as a result of higher funding\ncosts.\n\nAverage investment securities of $135.4\nbillion in the first quarter of 2024 declined\n$2.0 billion, or 1%, and $8.0 billion, or 6%,\nfrom the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first\nquarter of 2023, respectively. In both\ncomparisons, limited purchase activity was\nmore than offset by portfolio paydowns and\nmaturities. Average investment securities\nrepresented 26% of average interest-earning\nassets for the first quarter of 2024 compared\nto 27% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 28%\nfor the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAverage loans for the first quarter of 2024\ndecreased $4.0 billion, compared to the fourth\nquarter of 2023, due to lower commercial and\nconsumer loans. Compared to the first quarter\nof 2023, average loans decreased $4.9 billion,\nor 2%, primarily due to lower commercial\nloans. Average loans represented 63% of\naverage interest-earning assets for both the\nfirst quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter\nof 2023, compared to 64% for the first quarter\nof 2023.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the first quarter of 2024 increased $5.6\nbillion, or 13%, compared to the fourth\nquarter of 2023 driven by lower loan balances\nand higher borrowed funds, partially offset by\nlower deposits. Compared to the first quarter\nof 2023, average interest-earning deposits\nwith banks increased $14.2 billion, or 42%,\nprimarily due to higher borrowed funds and\nlower securities and loan balances, partially\noffset by lower deposits.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased\n$1.9 billion and $6.2 billion, compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter\nof 2023, respectively. The increase in both\ncomparisons reflected the impact of the higher\ninterest rate environment. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits represented 81% of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities for both\nthe first quarter of 2024 and the fourth\nquarter of 2023, compared to 83% for the first\nquarter of 2023.\n\nAverage borrowed funds of $75.6 billion in the\nfirst quarter of 2024 increased $2.7, billion,\nor 4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023\nand $12.6 billion, or 20%, compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2023. In both comparisons,\nthe increase was driven primarily by parent\ncompany senior debt issuances.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 37% for both the first quarter of\n2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, compared\nto 36% for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees increased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the\nfirst quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the\nimpact of higher average equity markets. PNC\u2019s\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased $6 billion and $18 billion compared\nto December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023,\nrespectively. In both comparisons, the\nincrease was primarily driven by higher spot\nequity markets.\n\nCapital markets and advisory fees declined\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven\nby lower merger and acquisition advisory\nactivity, partially offset by higher\nunderwriting fees. The decrease compared to\nthe first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to\nlower trading revenue, partially offset by\nhigher underwriting fees.\n\nCard and cash management revenue decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023, as\nseasonally lower consumer transaction volumes\nwere partially offset by higher treasury\nmanagement fees. The increase compared to the\nfirst three months of 2023 was primarily due\nto higher treasury management product revenue.\n\nLending and deposit services decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023,\nreflecting the reduction of certain checking\nproduct fees. Lending and deposit services\nwere stable compared to the first quarter of\n2023.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and\nincluded lower residential mortgage activity.\nThe decrease compared to the first quarter of\n2023 was driven by lower revenue from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased compared to\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, and included lower\ngains on sales. The decrease compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by\na decline in private equity revenue. In both\ncomparisons, the decrease was offset by lower\nnegative Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value\nadjustments. Visa Class B-1 fair value\nadjustments were negative $7 million for the\nfirst quarter of 2024 compared to negative\n$100 million for the fourth quarter of 2023\nand negative $45 million for the first quarter\nof 2023.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 7\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 5: Noninterest Expense                \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest expense decreased compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2023, driven by lower or\nstable expenses across all categories,\nreflecting a continued focus on expense\nmanagement.

31, 2024. In comparison to\nDecember 31, 2023:\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased modestly due to\nhigher balances held with the Federal Reserve\nBank, partially offset by lower securities and\nloan balances.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased modestly\nprimarily due to higher deposits.\n\n\u2022 Total equity increased due to the benefit of\nnet income, partially offset by dividends\npaid, a decline in AOCI and common share\nrepurchases.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion\nand $5.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.

Compared to\nDecember 31, 2023, our funding source\ncomposition included higher deposit balances\nand relatively stable borrowed funds.\n\nTotal deposits increased reflecting higher\ncommercial and consumer deposits. Noninterest-\nbearing deposit balances decreased driven by a\ndecline in commercial noninterest-bearing\nbalances. Interest-bearing deposits increased\nreflecting higher commercial and consumer\ninterest-bearing balances. This shift in\ndeposit composition, as well as higher deposit\nrates, contributed to an increase in funding\ncosts compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur total brokered deposit balances of $10.6\nbillion at March 31, 2024 decreased compared\nto $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, and\nwere significantly below both our internal and\nregulatory guidelines and limits.\n\nBorrowed funds were largely stable as parent\ncompany senior debt issuances were offset by\nlower FHLB borrowings.\n\nThe level and composition of borrowed funds\nfluctuates over time based on many factors,\nincluding market conditions, capital\nconsiderations, and funding needs, which are\nprimarily driven by changes in loan, deposit\nand investment securities balances. While our\nlargest source of liquidity on a consolidated\nbasis is the customer deposit base generated\nby our banking businesses, we also manage our\nborrowed funds to provide a reliable source of\nliquidity for our banking and other\nactivities, considering our LCR and NSFR\nrequirements and other internal and external\nguidelines and constraints.

three\nmonths of 2024 increased $0.4 billion compared\nto the same period in 2023 primarily due to\nhigher revenue and a lower provision for\ncredit losses, as well as lower noninterest\nexpense.\n\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits,\npartially offset by declines in average\ndeposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income increased in the\ncomparison, reflecting lower negative Visa\nClass B-1 derivative fair value adjustments,\npartially offset by lower card and cash\nmanagement fees.\n\nProvision for credit losses reflected the\nimpact of portfolio activity and improved\nmacroeconomic factors.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased in the\ncomparison, and included lower

Average\nconsumer loans decreased driven by lower\nresidential real estate as a result of\npaydowns outpacing new volume, as well as\ncontinued declines in education loans from\nrunoff in the government guaranteed portfolio.\nAverage commercial loans increased due to\ngrowth in automobile dealer segment balances.\n\nOur focus on growing primary customer\nrelationships is at the core of our deposit\nstrategy in Retail, which is based on\nattracting and retaining stable, low-cost\ndeposits as a key funding source for PNC. We\nhave taken a disciplined approach to pricing,\nfocused on retaining relationship-based\nbalances and executing on targeted deposit\ngrowth and retention strategies aimed at more\nrate-sensitive customers. Our goal with regard\nto deposits is to optimize balances, economics\nand long-term customer growth. In the first\nthree months of 2024, average total deposits\ndecreased compared to the same period in 2023,\nreflecting the impact of quantitative\ntightening by the Federal Reserve and\ncompetitive pricing dynamics.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe operate and continue to optimize a coast-\nto-coast network of retail branches and ATMs,\nwhich are complemented by PNC\u2019s suite of\ndigital capabilities. In February 2024, PNC\nannounced it would be investing nearly $1.0\nbillion, through 2028, to open more than 100\nnew branches in key locations, including\nAustin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, and\nSan Antonio, and to renovate more than 1,200\nexisting locations across the country to\nenhance the customer experience.\n\n14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

Average loans for\nthis business declined largely due to paydowns\noutpacing new production, partially offset by\na higher average utilization of loan\ncommitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is mainly secured by\nbusiness assets. Average loans for this\nbusiness declined primarily driven by a lower\naverage utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by\npaydowns outpacing new production and a lower\naverage utilization of loan commitments.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits decreased compared\nto the three months ended March 31, 2023,\nreflecting the impact of quantitative\ntightening by the Federal Reserve and\ncompetitive pricing dynamics. We continue to\nactively monitor the interest rate environment\nand make adjustments to our deposit strategy\nin response to evolving market conditions,\nbank funding needs and client relationship\ndynamics.\n                                              \n  Product Revenue                             \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital markets\nand advisory products and services and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, for\ncustomers of all business segments. On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationships\nexist. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services. A discussion of the\nconsolidated revenue from these services\nfollows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nTreasury management revenue is reported in\nnoninterest income and net interest income.\nNoninterest income includes treasury\nmanagement product revenue less earnings\ncredits provided to customers on compensating\ndeposit balances used to pay for products and\nservices. Net interest income includes funding\ncredit from all treasury management customer\ndeposit balances. Compared to the first three\nmonths of 2023, treasury management revenue\nincreased due to wider interest rate spreads\non the value of deposits and higher product\nrevenue.\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\n\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\n\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities increased in the comparison\nprimarily due to higher commercial mortgage\n\nservicing income, partially offset by lower\nrevenue from commercial mortgage loans held\nfor sale.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading. The increase in\ncapital markets and advisory fees in the\ncomparison was mostly driven by higher\nunderwriting fees and merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees, partially offset by

Owner occupied commercial\nreal estate loans are well-diversified across\nindustries. The comparable amount of owner\noccupied commercial real estate loans at\nDecember 31, 2023 was $9.6 billion.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate loans comprised $20.8\nbillion related to commercial mortgages on\nincome-producing properties, $8.5 billion of\nintermediate-term financing loans, and $6.3\nbillion of real estate construction project\nloans as of March 31, 2024. Comparable amounts\nas of December 31, 2023 were $21.0 billion,\n$8.0 billion, and $6.4 billion, respectively.\nCommercial real estate primarily consists of\nan investment in land and/or buildings held to\ngenerate income, that income serves as the\nprimary source for the repayment of the loan.\nHowever, for all commercial real estate\nassets, the disposition of the assigned\ncollateral serves as a secondary source of\nrepayment for the loan should the borrower\nexperience cash generation difficulties.\n\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith commercial real estate loans tend to be\ncorrelated to the loan structure, collateral\nlocation and quality, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk.

Also, the portfolio is well\ndiversified geographically across our coast-\nto-coast franchise. Within the office\nportfolio at March 31, 2024, criticized loans\ntotaled 26.4% and nonperforming loans totaled\n10.5%, while delinquencies were zero. As\nmeasured at origination, the weighted average\nLTV for the office portfolio was 58%; however,\nupdated appraisals have increased the weighted\naverage LTV to 69% as of March 31, 2024. While\nLTV is one consideration, our risk assessment\nconsiders a number of factors in assessing the\nchanging conditions affecting the portfolio.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we have established\nreserves of 9.7% against office loans.\n\nThe greatest stress in our office portfolio is\nobserved in multi-tenant office loans, which\nrepresents 57% of the portfolio at March 31,\n2024. Within the multi-tenant classification,\ncriticized levels were 45.1% while\nnonperforming loans totaled 18.1%, accounting\nfor almost all of the nonperforming office\npopulation. The weighted average LTV for\nmulti-tenant is 75% at March 31, 2024.\nAdditionally, commercial real estate charge-\noffs since the beginning of 2023 have\nprimarily been multi-tenant office loans.\nGiven the higher level of stress, this segment\nhas a proportionally higher reserve rate of\n14.4%. The remaining 43% of the office\nportfolio is primarily comprised of single-\ntenant, medical and government tenant\nproperties. This subset of the portfolio is\nperforming considerably better, with\napproximately 1% of the book in the criticized\nand nonperforming loan categories. As of March\n31, 2024, the weighted average LTV of this\nbook is 59%.\n\nPortfolio management efforts have escalated\nfor the office portfolio, with internal risk\nratings completed for each asset quarterly,\naccelerated reappraisal requirements and\nelevated approval levels for any credit\naction. Refreshed appraisals have updated\nvaluations on nearly all of the criticized\noffice exposure since the beginning of 2023.\nAdditionally, active management efforts\ninclude ongoing performance assessments as\nwell as the review of property, lending and\ncapital markets. Portfolio updates are\ndistributed to senior management weekly.\n\nGiven the ongoing change in this area, we\nexpect additional stress in the office sector,\nand a portion of this stress will bear itself\nout as we work through maturities that will\napproximate 42% over the next twelve months.\nUpon maturity, and where the balance is not\npaid in full, an extension may be granted\nbecause contractual extension terms are met;\nalternatively, an extension may be granted\nbased on\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 21\nnegotiated terms, and a portion of these\nextensions may involve the curtailment or\ncharge off of principal. We continue to\nactively manage the portfolio, and we believe\nreserve levels adequately reflect the expected\ncredit losses in the portfolio.\n\nCommercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, our outstanding loan\nbalances in the multifamily portfolio totaled\n$16.1 billion, or 5.0% of total loans, while\nadditional unfunded loan commitments totaled\n$3.8 billion. Although inflationary pressures\nand higher interest rates have impacted\ninternal risk assessments and regulatory\nclassification in this portfolio, we have not\nseen a notable change in loan performance at\nthis time with regards to nonperformance,\ndelinquency or charge-offs. We continue to\nclosely monitor our exposure in this sector.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  19\u2026    42    %    $  1\u2026     42   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            4\u2026      8      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     2            1\u2026      2      \n  \u2026       991     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    19            8\u2026     19      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  47\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  772                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              73    %              73   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at March 31, 2024.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us. We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $42.4 billion at March 31, 2024,\nwith 46% located in California. Comparable\namounts at December 31, 2023 were $42.4\nbillion and 45%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $20.6 billion of\nhome equity lines of credit and $5.3 billion\nof closed-end home equity installment loans at\nMarch 31, 2024. Comparable amounts were $20.6\nbillion and $5.6 billion as of December 31,\n2023, respectively. Home equity lines of\ncredit are a variable interest rate product\nwith fixed rate conversion options available\nto certain borrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\ntrack borrower performance of this portfolio\non a monthly basis. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, legacy brokered home\nequity loans, home equity lines of credit or\nlegacy brokered home equity lines of credit)\nand track the historical performance of any\nrelated mortgage loans regardless of\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nwhether we hold such liens. This information\nis used for internal reporting and risk\nmanagement. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien\nposition and geographic concentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 19: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4,\u2026    18    %    $  4\u2026     18   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    12            3\u2026     12      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     9            2\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     8            2\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     6            1\u2026      6      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       6,\u2026    24            6\u2026     23      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  25\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              51    %              52   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              49                   48      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  772                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              63    %              64   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at March 31, 2024.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $13.8 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.0 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of March 31,\n2024.

PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the first quarter of 2024.\nFluctuations in our average LCR result from\nchanges to the components of the calculation,\nincluding high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR daily and are required to\nmaintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The\nNSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the\nregulatory minimum requirement throughout the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 27\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits increased to\n$425.6 billion at March 31, 2024 from $421.4\nbillion at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-\nbearing deposit balances decreased driven by a\ndecline in commercial noninterest-bearing\nbalances. Interest-bearing deposits increased\nreflecting higher commercial and consumer\ninterest-bearing balances. As of March 31,\n2024, uninsured deposits represented\napproximately 43% of our total deposit base,\nwhich is estimated based on the regulatory\ninstructions in the Consolidated Reports of\nCondition and Income - FFIEC 031. The majority\nof our uninsured deposits are related to\ncommercial operating and relationship\naccounts, which we define as commercial\ndeposit customers who utilize two or more PNC\nproducts. See the Funding Sources portion of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and\nBusiness Segments Review sections of this\nFinancial Review for additional information on\nour deposits and related strategies.\n\nWe may also obtain liquidity through various\nforms of funding, including long-term debt\n(senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB\nborrowings) and short-term borrowings\n(securities sold under repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper and other short-term\nborrowings). See the Funding Sources section\nof the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in\nthis Financial Review and Note 7 Borrowed\nFunds in this Report for additional\ninformation related to our borrowings.\n\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, increased due to the\nfollowing activity:\n                                              \n  Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt      \n                                              \n                                         \n  In billions                      2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01               $  31.7        \n  Issuances                   2.5        \n  Calls and maturities       -1.1        \n  Other                      -0.4        \n  March 31                $  32.7        \n                                         \nAdditionally, certain liquid assets and unused\nborrowing capacity from a number of sources\nare also available to manage our liquidity\nposition. PNC has a contingency funding plan\ndesigned to ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of\nliquidity stress. This plan is designed to\nexamine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides the strategies for\naddressing liquidity needs and responsive\nactions we would consider during liquidity\nstress events, which could include the\nissuance of incremental debt, preferred stock,\nor additional deposit actions, including the\nissuance of brokered CDs. The plan also\naddresses the governance, frequency of\nreporting and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of liquidity stress.\n\nPNC defines our primary contingent liquidity\nsources as cash held at the Federal Reserve\nBank, investment securities and unused\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal\nReserve Bank.

At March 31,\n2024, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or issuing intercompany\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n   Parent Company Liquidity                   \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we manage the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $21.7 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $5.7 billion at March 31, 2024.\nSee Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023\nForm 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Under the parent company\u2019s\n2014 commercial paper program, the parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At March 31, 2024, there\nwere no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nThe following table details parent company\nnote issuances in the first quarter of 2024:\n

Consistent with the SCB\nframework, which allows for capital return in\namounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels,\nour Board of Directors has authorized a\nrepurchase framework under the previously\napproved repurchase program of up to 100\nmillion common shares, of which approximately\n44% were still available for repurchase at\nMarch 31, 2024. In light of the Federal\nbanking agencies proposed rules to adjust the\nBasel III capital framework, second quarter of\n2024 share repurchase activity is expected to\napproximate the recent quarterly average share\nrepurchase levels. PNC continues to evaluate\nthe potential impact of the proposed rules and\nmay adjust share repurchase activity depending\non market and economic conditions, as well as\nother factors. PNC\u2019s SCB for the four-quarter\nperiod beginning October 1, 2023 is the\nregulatory minimum of 2.5%.\n\nOn April 3, 2024 the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on

Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024.

As of the first\nquarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet\ncomposition by the end of year one is\ngenerally consistent with the spot composition\nas of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nDeposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are\nprimarily driven by changes in the Federal\nFunds rate, with the relationship between\ndeposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined\nas deposit beta. We define cumulative deposit\nbeta as the change in deposit rate paid on\ninterest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided\nby the change in the upper level of the stated\nFederal Funds rate range since the first\nquarter of 2022, the start of the current\nrising rate cycle. As of March 31, 2024 PNC\u2019s\ncumulative deposit beta was 45%, an increase\nfrom 35% at March 31, 2023. For interest rate\nrisk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to\nadjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending\non market rate levels as well as other\nfactors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect\nhistorical experience and future expectations.\nOur scenario assumes that deposit betas\nincreased slightly from current levels. Actual\ndeposit rates paid may differ from modeled\nprojections due to variables such as\ncompetition for deposits and customer\nbehavior.\n\nAsset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment\nassumptions for both loan and investment\nportfolios. Mortgage and home equity\nportfolios utilize an industry standard model\nto drive estimated prepayments that increase\nin lower rate environments. Commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios assume static\nconstant prepayment rates that are consistent\nacross rate scenarios, as those portfolios\nhistorically do not exhibit significantly\ndifferent prepayment behaviors based upon the\nlevel of market rates.\n\nImpact of Derivatives : PNC uses interest rate\nderivatives to hedge floating rate commercial\nloans. PNC had $36.5 billion in receive fix /\npay float swaps as of March 31, 2024, with a\nweighted average duration of 2.0 years and an\naverage fixed rate of 2.30%. As of March 31,\n2024 PNC also had collars in place, reflecting\n$12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of\nfloors, that are used to hedge these\n\n32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\ncommercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes\nreceive fix / pay float swaps as a means of\nhedging fixed rate debt.

EVE sensitivity\nto interest rate changes is a complementary\nmetric to NII sensitivity analysis and\nrepresents an estimation of long-term interest\nrate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity\nby measuring the changes in the economic value\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments in response to an instantaneous\n+/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.\nSimilar to the NII sensitivity analysis, we\nincorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan\nprepayment assumptions. These methodologies\nare largely consistent between the EVE and NII\nsensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit\nattrition is a significant contributor to EVE\nsensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected\nbased on a dynamic model developed using long-\nterm historical deposit behavior in addition\nto management assumptions including\naccelerated attrition for pandemic related\nexcess deposits. PNC performs various\nsensitivity analyses to understand the impact\nof faster and slower deposit attrition on our\nrisk metrics, with the results reported to\nALCO.\n\nCompared to the first quarter of 2023, there\nhave been no material changes to our NII\nsensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,\nincluding data sources that drive assumptions\nsetting.\n\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Customer-Related\nTrading Risk\n\nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. VaR is calculated for each of\nthe portfolios that comprise our customer-\nrelated trading activities of which the\nmajority are covered positions as defined by\nthe Market Risk Rule.

The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower derivative client sales\nrevenues, partially offset by securities\nunderwriting client revenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

These tax\ncredit investment balances included unfunded\ncommitments totaling $2.2 billion and $2.5\nbillion at March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. These unfunded commitments\nare included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNote 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities in our 2023 Form\n10-K has further information on tax credit\ninvestments.\n\nPrivate Equity and Other\n\nThe largest component of our other equity\ninvestments is our private equity portfolio.\nThe private equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $2.2\nbillion at both March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, $2.0 billion\nwas invested directly in a variety of\ncompanies and $0.2 billion was invested\nindirectly through various private equity\nfunds.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B-1 common shares, which are\nrecorded at cost. Visa Class B-1 common shares\nthat we own are transferable only under\nlimited circumstances until they can be\nconverted into shares of the publicly-traded\nClass A common shares, which cannot happen\nuntil the resolution of the pending\ninterchange litigation, subject to the\nexchange offer described in Note 16 Subsequent\nEvents. Based upon the March 31, 2024 per\nshare closing price of $279.08 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B-1 common\nshares was approximately $1.6 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B-1 shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. The estimated value does not\nrepresent fair value of the Visa B-1 common\nshares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace. See Note 14\nFair Value and Note 20 Legal Proceedings in\nour 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 Legal\nProceedings in this Report for additional\ninformation regarding our Visa agreements. See\nNote 16 Subsequent Events for additional\ndetails on Visa\u2019s recently announced exchange\noffer for Visa Class B-1 common stock.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains (losses) related to\nthese investments were $(6) million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and $21\nmillion for the three months ended March 31,\n2023.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional and an underlying as\nspecified in the contract. Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15\nFinancial Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K\nand in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12\nFinancial Derivatives in this Report.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ECENT                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGULATORY                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVELOPMENTS                                 \n                                              \nFederal agencies and states, including the\nfederal agencies responsible for the Federal\nAcquisition Regulations, California, and most\nrecently in March 2024, the SEC, have\nseparately proposed or finalized rules that\nwould require certain companies or government\ncontractors, such as PNC or PNC Bank, to\ndisclose significant amounts of climate-\nrelated information. This information includes\nqualitative and quantitative disclosures of\nmaterial climate-related risks and their\nimpact, governance and management, targets and\ngoals, and greenhouse gas emissions. The\ngreenhouse gas emissions disclosures include\nthe company\u2019s direct emissions from owned or\ncontrolled sources (Scope 1) and indirect\nemissions from the company\u2019s consumption of\nenergy purchased from third parties (Scope 2),\nand in the case of the Federal Acquisition\nRegulations proposal for a \u201cmajor contractor\u201d\nand California laws, disclosures related to\nindirect emissions from upstream and\ndownstream activities in the company\u2019s value\nchain (Scope 3). If and when all the rules are\nfinalized, PNC and PNC Bank may face\npotentially differing standards from the\nagencies or California. Numerous lawsuits have\nchallenged the SEC and California rules, and\non April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed\nimplementation of its final rules pending\nresolution of the lawsuits challenging the SEC\nrules.\n\n34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nOur consolidated financial statements are\nprepared by applying certain accounting\npolicies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2023 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected prepayments\nand estimated recoveries. Our determination of\nthe ACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We\nincorporate qualitative factors in the ACL\nthat reflect our best estimate of expected\nlosses that may not be adequately represented\nin our quantitative methods or economic\nassumptions. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to the\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and the timing of peak business\ncycles reflected by the scenarios could\nmaterially affect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio\nvolume and mix could materially affect our\nestimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework that includes a three-year\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios with associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes. Credit losses\nestimated in our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of the scenarios used and weights\nassigned to them.\n\nTo forecast the distribution of economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then\ngiven an associated probability (weight) to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the forecast period. This\nprocess is informed by current economic\nconditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s RAC. This\napproach seeks to provide a reasonable\nrepresentation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate\nexpected credit losses across a variety of\nloans, securities and other financial assets.\nEach quarter, the scenarios and their\nrespective weights are presented to RAC for\napproval.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended March\n31, 2024 consider, among other factors,\nongoing inflationary pressures and the\ncorresponding tightness of monetary policy and\ncredit availability. While recession risks\nremain elevated, our most-likely expectation\nat March 31, 2024 is that the U.S. economy\nnarrowly avoids a recession in 2024.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 35\nTable 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                 as of March                  \n                    31, 2024                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. real             0.8%    1.7%    2.1%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.6%    4.8%    4.3%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2023                  \n                        2024    2025    2026  \n  U.S. real             0.1%    1.5%    2.0%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  unemploym\u2026            4.5%    4.6%    4.2%  \n  rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss)\nrates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at\n0.8% on a weighted average basis, up from the\n0.1% assumed at December 31, 2023, primarily\ndue to stronger expected economic activity in\n2024 than what was expected at the end of\n2023. Growth then rises to 1.7% in 2025,\nbefore growing to 2.1% in 2026. The weighted-\naverage unemployment rate is expected to end\n2024 at 4.6%, up slightly from the 4.5%\nassumed at December 31, 2023. During the\nsecond half of 2025, the weighted-average\nunemployment increases to a peak of 5.0%\nbefore gradually improving to 4.8% by the\nfourth quarter of 2025. Further improvement is\nthen expected in 2026 with the rate reaching\n4.3% by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nThe current state of the economy continues to\nreflect uncertainty due to the foundational\nchange in office demand from the acceptance of\nremote work, combined with inflationary\npressures, interest rate movements, and\ndeclining consumer savings and deposit\nbalances. As such, for both our commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and\nperformed significant analyses around segments\nimpacted by such uncertainties to ensure our\nreserves are adequate, given our current\nmacroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment.

Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 Our ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting. These statements are\nbased on our views that:\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline forecast is for slower\neconomic growth in 2024 as consumer spending\ngrowth slows and higher interest rates remain\na drag on the economy. The ongoing strength of\nthe labor market will continue to support\nconsumer spending. The FOMC is indicating that\nit will start to cut the federal funds rate\nlater this year, with rate cuts supporting\neconomic growth toward the end of 2024.\n\n\u2013 Real GDP growth this year will be close to\nits trend of 2% and the unemployment rate will\nincrease modestly to just above 4% by the end\nof 2024. Inflation will continue to slow as\nwage pressures abate, moving back to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s 2% long-term objective by\nthe end of 2025.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain\nunchanged between 5.25% and 5.50% through at\nleast the first half of 2024, with federal\nfunds rate cuts starting in the third quarter\nas inflationary pressures ease further. PNC\nexpects two federal funds rate cuts in 2024,\nwith the rate ending this year in a range\nbetween 4.75% and 5.00%.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding minimum capital levels, including a\nstress capital buffer established by the\nFederal Reserve Board in connection with the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things,\nPNC\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired or strategic initiative, including in\nsome cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K\nand elsewhere in this Report, including in the\nRisk Factors and Risk Management sections and\nthe Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nin these reports.

We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior-year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a\n\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial\ncondition or results of operations.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2023 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2023 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements. There have been no significant\nchanges to our accounting policies as\ndisclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements.

The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n281million and $ 144million, respectively.\nThese amounts are included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 87million for securities\navailable for sale, primarily related to non-\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities,\nand $ 6million for securities held to maturity\nat March 31, 2024. The comparable amounts at\nDecember 31, 2023 were $ 86million and $\n6million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held to maturity securities transferred\nfrom available for sale are included in held\nto maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 4.0billion at March 31, 2024\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax. The comparable\namount at December 31, 2023 was $ 4.2billion.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at March 31,\n2024 included $ 262million of net unsettled\npurchases that represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for March 31, 2023 was $\n30million of net unsettled sales.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At March 31, 2024, the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 93million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2023 was $ 92million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the methodologies used to\ndetermine the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, AOCI included pretax losses\nof $ 289million from derivatives that hedged\nthe purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 36 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.

Loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option are reported\nas performing loans; however, when nonaccrual\ncriteria is met, interest income is not\nrecognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.

6and 12months. These programs are\nstructurally similar such that the interest\nrate is reduced to a standard rate of 4.99%\nand the minimum payment percentage is adjusted\nto 1.90% of the outstanding balance. At the\nend of the 6or 12months, the borrower is\nreturned to the original contractual interest\nrate and minimum payment amount specified in\nthe original lending agreement.\n\n\u2022 Fully-amortized repayment plans are also\ngranted, the most common of which being a 60\nmonth program. In this program, we convert the\nborrower\u2019s drawn and unpaid balances into a\nfully-amortized repayment plan consisting of\nan interest rate of 4.99% and an adjusted\nminimum payment percentage of 1.90% of the\noutstanding balance. This fully-amortized\nprogram is designed in a manner that allows\nthe drawn and unpaid amounts to be recaptured\nat the end of the 60months.\n\n\u2022 Home equity loans and lines of credit\n\n\u2022 Fixed payment plan programs establish a\nmodified monthly payment that is informed by\nthe borrower\u2019s financial situation and the\ncurrent market environment at the time of\nmodification, among other factors.

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 51\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.8billion at March\n31, 2024 and $ 3.7billion at December 31,\n2023, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages which are measured at fair value.\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. MSRs are subject to\nchanges in value from actual or expected\nprepayment of the underlying loans and\ndefaults, as well as market driven changes in\ninterest rates. We manage this risk by\neconomically hedging the fair value of MSRs\nwith securities, derivative instruments and\nresale agreements, which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 5 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 53 and 54. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. Changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in another ( e.g.\n, changes in mortgage interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rate estimates,\ncould result in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions:\nTable 53: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key Valuation Assumptions\n

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow March 31, 2024,\nwe expect to reclassify net derivative losses\nof $ 1.2billion pretax, or $ 0.9billion after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to March 31, 2024. As\nof March 31, 2024, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n\n78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail regarding

These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin.

Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 20\nLegal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K (such\nprior disclosure referred to as \u201cPrior\nDisclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters where we\nare able to estimate such possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, as of March 31,\n2024, we estimate that it is reasonably\npossible that we could incur losses in excess\nof related accrued liabilities, if any, in an\naggregate amount less than $ 300million. The\nestimates included in this amount are based on\nour analysis of currently available\ninformation and are subject to significant\njudgment and a variety of assumptions and\nuncertainties. As new information is obtained\nwe may change our estimates. Due to the\ninherent subjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of outcomes of legal\nproceedings, any amounts accrued or included\nin this aggregate amount may not represent the\nultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings\nin question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the Disclosed Matters, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nIn March 2024, the parties to the class action\nseeking equitable relief in the proceedings in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York under the caption In re\nPayment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-\nDiscount Antitrust Litigation (Master File No.\n1:05-md-1720-MKB-JAM) entered into an\nagreement for certain rule and rate changes to\nresolve the matter. The settlement must be\npreliminarily approved by the district court\nprior to issuance of notice to the class and\nproceedings to consider final approval.\n\nSee Note 16 Subsequent Events for a discussion\nof Visa\u2019s recently announced exchange offer\nfor Visa Class B-1 common stock.\n\n82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences. Our practice is to\ncooperate fully with regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations, audits and other\ninquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted.

The decline in\nOther earnings for the first three months of\n2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was\ndriven by the residual impacts from funds\ntransfer pricing due to the rising interest\nrate environment, along with the costs for the\nFDIC special assessment.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nFunds Transfer Pricing\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology, which is designed to\nconsider interest rate and liquidity risks.\nUnder our methodology, assets receive a\nfunding charge while liabilities and capital\nreceive a funding credit based on market\ninterest rates, product characteristics and\nother factors.\n\nOur transfer pricing framework considers the\napplication of funding curves and\nmethodologies consistently across the balance\nsheet. A residual gain or loss from funds\ntransfer pricing operations is retained within\nOther. This residual gain or loss is reviewed\nby management quarterly, in accordance with\nthe interagency guidance of the FDIC, Federal\nReserve and OCC.\n\nSegment Allocations\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstandalone basis, and includes expense\nallocations for corporate overhead services\nused by the business segments.\n\nCertain costs are retained within Other. These\ncosts are not allocated to our business\nsegments because they (i) are transitory or\nhighly irregular in nature, (ii) exist solely\nto support corporate activities unrelated to\nbusiness segment operations, or (iii) reflect\nresidual costs for an exited business. During\nthe first quarter of 2024, Other noninterest\nexpense for the Other category included an\nadditional expense related to the increase in\nthe FDIC\u2019s expected losses.

        \nOn April 8, 2024, Visa launched the first of\nits previously announced exchange offers\nallowing holders of the currently restricted\noutstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common\nstock to exchange all or a portion of such\nshares for equal parts of Visa Class B-2\ncommon stock and Visa Class C common stock,\nand cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The\nexchange period is set to close on or about\nMay 3, 2024. Following the closing of this\ninitial exchange offer, and acceptance by Visa\nof PNC\u2019s request to fully participate in the\nexchange program, PNC would be able to\nliquidate 50percent of its holdings in Visa\nduring the second and third quarters of 2024\nby transferring newly held Visa Class C common\nstock in certain transactions where such stock\nwould convert into publicly traded Visa Class\nA common stock, which could then be sold in\nmarket transactions, subject to certain timing\nrestrictions. The Visa Class B-2 common stock\nPNC receives in the initial exchange offer\nwould remain subject to the same restrictions\ncurrently imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common\nstock. Participation in the exchange requires\nPNC to agree to a make-whole agreement that\nsubjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations\nto Visa as are currently present. PNC has\ntendered its Class B-1 common stock to fully\nparticipate in the exchange program.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 87\n

In\nlight of the Federal banking agencies proposed\nrules to adjust the Basel III capital\nframework, second quarter of 2024 share\nrepurchase activity is expected to approximate\nthe recent quarterly average share repurchase\nlevels. PNC continues to evaluate the\npotential impact of the proposed rules and may\nadjust share repurchase activity depending on\nmarket and economic conditions, as well as\nother factors.
