per diluted\ncommon share, for the first quarter of 2023,\nprimarily due to lower noninterest income, net\ninterest income and increased expenses,\npartially offset by a lower provision for\ncredit

rights\nvaluation, net of economic hedge and lower\nrevenue from market sensitive businesses,\npartially offset by seasonally higher consumer\ntransaction volumes and increased treasury\nmanagement product revenue.

For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income decreased $75 million, or\n2%, for the second quarter of 2023 compared to\nthe first quarter of 2023, as higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets were more than offset\nby increased funding costs as well as lower\nloan and securities balances. Net interest\nincome increased $1.2 billion, or 21%, for the\nfirst six months of 2023 compared to the same\nperiod in 2022, as a result of higher\ninterest-earning asset yields and balances,\npartially offset by higher funding costs. Net\ninterest margin decreased 5 basis points\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023 as the\nchange in yields on interest-earning assets\nwas more than offset by the change in rates on\nfunding costs. Net interest margin increased\n42 basis points in the year-to-date comparison\nreflecting the benefit of higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAverage investment securities for the second\nquarter of 2023 decreased $2.4 billion, or 2%\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023\nprimarily due to prepayments and maturities\noutpacing purchases. Average investment\nsecurities increased $7.9 billion, or 6% in\nthe year-to-date comparison, due to net\nsecurities purchases, primarily of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities.\nAverage investment securities represented 28%\nof average interest-earning assets for both\nthe second and first quarters of 2023, and 28%\nfor the first six months of 2023 compared to\n27% for the first six months of 2022.\n\nAverage loans for the second quarter of 2023\nwere stable compared to the first quarter of\n2023. Average loans increased $27.2 billion,\nor 9% in the year-to-date comparison,\nreflecting growth in both commercial and\nconsumer loans. Average loans represented 64%\nof average interest-earning assets for both\nthe second and first quarters of 2023, and 64%\nfor the first six months of 2023 compared to\n60% for the first six months of 2022.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the second quarter of 2023 decreased $2.6\nbillion, or 8%, compared to the first quarter\nof 2023, reflecting lower deposit balances. In\nthe year-to-date comparison, average interest-\nearning deposits with banks decreased $18.4\nbillion, or 36%, primarily due to higher loan\nbalances and lower deposits, partially offset\nby higher borrowed funds.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nsecond quarter of 2023 decreased $2.5 billion,\nor 1%, compared to the first quarter of 2023,\nreflecting increased consumer spending, the\nimpact of quantitative tightening by the\nFederal Reserve and consumer tax payments.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased\n$15.5 billion, or 5%, in the year-to-date\ncomparison, reflecting the continued shift\nfrom noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing\nas deposit rates have risen. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits represented 83% of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities for both\nthe second and first quarters of 2023 and 83%\nfor the first six months of 2023 compared to\n90%, for the first six months of 2022.\n\nAverage borrowed funds increased $2.7 billion,\nor 4%, and $31.3 billion, or 95% in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively. The increase in both comparisons\nwas due to higher FHLB borrowings and parent\ncompany senior debt issuances.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 34% for the second quarter of 2023\ncompared to 36% for the first quarter of 2023,\nand 35% for the first six months of 2023\ncompared to 40% for the same period in 2022.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees decreased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023, and\nincluded lower annuity sales. The decrease in\nthe year-to-date comparison reflected the\nimpact of lower average equity markets and\nannuity sales. PNC\u2019s discretionary client\nassets under management of $176 billion at\nJune 30, 2023 decreased from $177 billion at\nMarch 31, 2023, and included the impact of\nclient activity, partially offset by higher\nspot equity markets. PNC\u2019s discretionary\nclient assets under management increased from\n$167 billion at June 30, 2022, driven by\nhigher spot equity markets, partially offset\nby client activity.\n\nCapital markets and advisory fees decreased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023 driven\nby lower merger and acquisition advisory fees\nand a decline in loan syndication revenue. The\ndecrease in the year-to-date comparison was\nprimarily due to lower merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees.\n\nCard and cash management revenue increased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023,\nreflecting seasonally higher consumer\ntransaction volumes and increased treasury\nmanagement product revenue. The increase\ncompared to the first six months of 2022 was\ndue to increased treasury management product\nrevenue and higher customer transaction\nvolumes.\n\nLending and deposit services decreased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023 and\nincreased in the year-to-date comparison,\nreflecting client-related activity. In\ncomparison to the first six months of 2022,\nthe increase was also driven by growth in loan\ncommitment fees.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 7\nResidential and commercial mortgage decreased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2023\nprimarily due to a $58 million decrease in\nmortgage servicing rights valuation, net of\neconomic hedge. The decrease compared to the\nfirst six months of 2022 was driven by lower\ncommercial mortgage banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased in the\nquarterly comparison and was stable in the\nyear-to-date comparison. Both comparisons\nincluded lower private equity revenue and the\nimpact of negative Visa Class B derivative\nfair value adjustments related to litigation\nescrow funding and other valuation changes.\nNegative Visa Class B fair value adjustments\nwere $83 million for the second quarter of\n2023 compared to $45 million for the first\nquarter of 2023, and $128 million for the\nfirst six months of 2023 compared to $12\nmillion for the same period in 2022.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 5: Noninterest Expense                \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest expense increased compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2023, primarily due to\nseasonally higher marketing spend and the full\nquarter impact of annual employee merit\nincreases. The increase compared to the first\nsix months of 2022 was due to higher personnel\ncosts, an increased FDIC assessment rate and\nhigher marketing and technology costs to\nsupport business growth.\n\nIn July 2023, we raised our continuous\nimprovement program savings goal from $400\nmillion to $450 million for 2023.\n\nWe expect the FDIC will enact a special\ndeposit insurance assessment in the second\nhalf of 2023 that will significantly increase\nour FDIC deposit insurance costs. Based on the\ncurrent proposal, PNC estimates our total cost\nto be approximately $468 million pre-tax, or\n$370 million after-tax, which would be\nincurred in the quarter the FDIC finalizes the\nrule.

Average loans for\nthis business increased driven by strong new\nproduction throughout 2022 and higher average\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased largely due to new\nproduction throughout 2022, partially offset\nby a lower average utilization of loan\ncommitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased primarily\ndriven by new production, partially offset by\nlower average utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by PPP\nloan forgiveness and lower average utilization\nof loan commitments.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits decreased compared\nto the six months ended June 30, 2022,\nreflecting the impact of quantitative\ntightening by the Federal Reserve. We continue\nto actively monitor the interest rate\nenvironment and make adjustments to our\ndeposit strategy in response to evolving\nmarket conditions, bank funding needs and\nclient relationship dynamics.\n\nFollowing the BBVA acquisition in 2021 and our\nde novo expansion efforts, we are now a coast-\nto-coast franchise and have a presence in the\nlargest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical\nareas.

On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome and noninterest income, as appropriate.\nFrom a business perspective, the majority of\nthe revenue and expense related to these\nservices is reflected in the Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking segment results, and the\nremainder is reflected in the results of other\nbusinesses where the customer relationship\nexists. The Other Information section in Table\n13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC\nfor treasury management and commercial\nmortgage banking services. A discussion of the\nconsolidated revenue from these services\nfollows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nTreasury management revenue is reported in\nnoninterest income and net interest income.\nNoninterest income includes treasury\nmanagement product revenue less earnings\ncredits provided to customers on compensating\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\ndeposit balances used to pay for products and\nservices. Net interest income includes funding\ncredit from all treasury management customer\ndeposit balances. Compared to the first six\nmonths of 2022, treasury management revenue\nincreased due to wider interest rate spreads\non the value of deposits and higher product\nrevenue.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower commercial mortgage\nservicing income.\n\nCapital markets and advisory includes services\nand activities primarily related to merger and\nacquisition advisory, equity capital markets\nadvisory, asset-backed financing, loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and\ncustomer-related trading. The decrease in\ncapital markets and advisory fees in the\ncomparison was mostly driven by lower merger\nand acquisition advisory fees, partially\noffset by higher customer-related trading\nrevenue for derivatives, foreign exchange and\nfixed income.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 19\n

From a tenancy category\nperspective, 57% of this portfolio represents\nmulti-tenant properties at June 30, 2023,\nwhich is an area where we have noted increased\nstress.

We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming or conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 23\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loan      \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ju\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  19\u2026    41    %    $  1\u2026     41   %  \n  \u2026       4,\u2026     9            4\u2026      9      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     7            3\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       974     2            9\u2026      2      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       8,\u2026    18            8\u2026     18      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  46\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  4\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          Ju\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  771                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              73    %              71   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at June 30, 2023.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us. We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $41.6 billion at June 30, 2023\nwith 45% located in California. Comparable\namounts at December 31, 2022 were $40.6\nbillion and 44%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $20.2 billion of\nhome equity lines of credit and $6.0 billion\nof closed-end home equity installment loans at\nJune 30, 2023. Comparable amounts were $19.5\nbillion and $6.5 billion as of December 31,\n2022, respectively. Home equity lines of\ncredit are a variable interest rate product\nwith fixed rate conversion options available\nto certain borrowers.\n\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, we\ntrack borrower performance of this portfolio\non a monthly basis. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, legacy brokered home\nequity loans, home equity lines of credit, or\nlegacy brokered home equity lines of credit)\nand track the historical performance of any\nrelated mortgage loans regardless of whether\nwe hold such liens. This information is used\nfor internal reporting and risk management. As\npart of our overall risk analysis and\nmonitoring, we also segment the portfolio\nbased upon loan delinquency, nonperforming\nstatus, modification and bankruptcy status,\nFICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes.

PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%. The LCR for each of PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the regulatory minimum requirement\nthroughout the second quarter of 2023.\nFluctuations in our average LCR result from\nchanges to the components of the calculation,\nincluding high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business\nactivity.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability\nof the maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank\ncalculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis and are\nrequired to maintain a regulatory minimum of\n100%.

At June 30,\n2023, there were no issuances outstanding\nunder this program.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank or through issuing its\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n   Parent Company Liquidity                   \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAt June 30, 2023, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $17.2 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $5.2 billion at June 30, 2023.\nSee Note 20 Regulatory Matters in our 2022\nForm 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Under the parent company\u2019s\n2014 commercial paper program, the parent\ncompany has the ability to offer up to $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity.

PNC continues to\nevaluate and may adjust share repurchase\nactivity, as actual amounts and timing are\ndependent on market and economic conditions,\nas well as other factors.\n\nOn July 3, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors\nraised the quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock to $1.55 per share, an increase of 5\ncents per share. The dividend, with a payment\ndate of August 5, 2023, will be payable the\nnext business day.\n\n32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table summarizes our Basel

The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC\u2019s\nelection to adopt the CECL five-year\ntransition provisions. Effective for the first\nquarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the\nfull impact of CECL and exclude the benefits\nof the optional five-year transition.\n\n(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have\nelected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\n\n(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-\nweighted assets are based on the Basel III\nstandardized approach rules and include credit\nand market risk-weighted assets.\n\n(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account the quarterly average of both on\nbalance sheet assets as well as certain off-\nbalance sheet items, including loan\ncommitments and potential future exposure\nunder derivative contracts.\n\n(f) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the allowance for PCD loans,\ncompared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective\nfor the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in\nthe three-year transition period, and the full\nimpact of the CECL standard is being phased-in\nto regulatory capital through December 31,\n2024. See additional discussion of this rule\nin the Supervision and Regulation section of\nItem 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of\nour 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nAt June 30, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d based on\napplicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and\na Leverage ratio of at least 5%. For more\ninformation on the interagency proposed\nexpanded risk-based capital rules, see the\nRecent Regulatory Developments section.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 33\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and we believe that our June 30,\n2023 capital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2022 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management                      \n                                              \nSee the Market Risk Management portion of the\nRisk Management Section in our 2022 Form 10-K\nfor additional discussion regarding market\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans. Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our market risk-related risk\nmanagement policies, which are approved by\nmanagement\u2019s Asset and Liability Committee and\nthe Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the second quarters of 2023 and\n2022 follow:\n                                              \n  Table 31: Interest Sensitivity Analysis     \n                                              \n                                              \n                   Second           Second    \n                   Quarter          Quarter   \n                   2023             2022      \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  parall\u2026                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       0.0  %           3.2  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis       0.0  %          -3.4  %         \n  point                                       \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  parall\u2026                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       1.4  %           5.6  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis      -1.6  %          -6.4  %         \n  point                                       \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n                                              \nIn addition to measuring the effect on net\ninterest income assuming parallel changes in\ncurrent interest rates, we routinely simulate\nthe effects of a number of nonparallel\ninterest rate environments.

These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. VaR is calculated for each of\nthe portfolios that comprise our customer-\nrelated trading activities of which the\nmajority are covered positions as defined by\nthe Market Risk Rule. VaR is computed with\npositions and market risk factors updated\ndaily to ensure each portfolio is operating\nwithin its acceptable limits. See the Market\nRisk Management \u2013 Customer-Related Trading\nRisk section of our 2022 Form 10-K for more\ninformation on our models used to calculate\nVaR and our backtesting process.\n\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $107\nmillion for the six months ended June 30,\n2023, compared to $198 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was\nmainly due to higher funding costs on the\ntrading positions inventory and lower\nderivative client sales revenues, partially\noffset by improved foreign exchange client\nrevenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.8\nbillion at both June 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, $1.6\nbillion was invested directly in a variety of\ncompanies and $0.2 billion was invested\nindirectly through various private equity\nfunds.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the June 30, 2023 per\nshare closing price of $237.48 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.3 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding our Visa\nagreements. The estimated value does not\nrepresent fair value of the Visa B common\nshares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $19 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and $23 million for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2022.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional and an underlying as\nspecified in the contract.

The FDIC currently\nestimates the cost of protecting the uninsured\ndepositors to the Deposit Insurance Fund at\napproximately $15.8 billion. By law, any\nlosses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to\nsupport uninsured depositors under the\nsystemic risk exception must be recovered by\none or more special assessments on insured\ndepository institutions or depository\ninstitution holding companies, or both. In May\n2023, the FDIC proposed a rule to implement\nthe special assessment. Under the proposal,\nthe FDIC would collect from PNC, along with\nother BHCs and insured depository\ninstitutions, special assessments at an annual\nrate of 12.5 basis points of PNC\u2019s uninsured\ndeposits reported as of December 31, 2022\n(adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion),\nover eight quarterly assessment periods,\nbeginning after the first quarter 2024.

In general, the\nproposed rule would align the regulatory\ncapital elements and required deductions for\nCategory III banking organizations such as PNC\nand PNC Bank with those currently applicable\nto Category I and II banking organizations and\napply a new expanded risk-based approach which\nleverages the Basel rules, including the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets (the\n\u201cexpanded risk-based approach\u201d) in addition to\nthe current U.S. standardized approach. Our\nreview of the proposal is ongoing. Among other\nimpacts, PNC and PNC Bank would be required to\nrecognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory\ncapital and deduct from CET1 capital, among\nother items, mortgage servicing assets and\ndeferred tax assets that individually exceed\n10 percent of CET1 capital or in the aggregate\nwith other threshold items that exceed 15\npercent of CET1 capital. The new expanded\nrisk-based approach to calculating risk-\nweighted assets would apply more granular and\nstandardized risk-weighting methodologies for\ncredit, operational, market, equity and credit\nvaluation adjustment risks. PNC and PNC Bank\nwould be required to calculate their risk-\nbased capital ratios under the existing\nstandardized approach and the expanded risk-\nbased approach and would be subject to the\nlower of the two resulting ratios for their\nrisk-based capital minimums and buffer\nrequirements, including the SCB. Based on our\ninitial review of the proposal, we expect the\nproposal, if finalized in its current form,\nwould result in lower pro forma capital ratios\nfor PNC and PNC Bank that would remain above\ncurrent minimum capital and buffer\nrequirements. The proposal indicates the\neffective date of the final rule would be July\n1, 2025, with certain provisions\u2014including the\nrecognition of AOCI elements in regulatory\ncapital and the increase in risk-weighted\nassets due to the expanded risk-based\napproach\u2014having a three-year phase-in period.\nComments on the proposal are due by November\n30, 2023.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 37\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nOur consolidated financial statements are\nprepared by applying certain accounting\npolicies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2022 Form 10-K describes the most significant\naccounting policies that we use. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2022\nForm 10-K. The following details the critical\nestimates and judgments around the ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments and\nestimated recoveries. Our determination of the\nACL is based on historical loss and\nperformance experience, as well as current\nborrower and transaction characteristics\nincluding collateral type and quality, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future conditions and\nother relevant factors. We use methods\nsensitive to changes in economic conditions to\ninterpret these factors and to estimate\nexpected credit losses. We evaluate and, when\nappropriate, enhance the quality of our data\nand models and other methods used to estimate\nthe ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate\nqualitative factors in the ACL that reflect\nour best estimate of expected losses that may\nnot be adequately represented in our\nquantitative methods or economic assumptions.\nThe major drivers of ACL estimates include,\nbut are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition and derecognized upon paydown,\nmaturity or sale.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder the CECL standard, we are required to\nconsider reasonable and supportable forecasts\nin estimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose, we have established a framework that\nincludes a three-year forecast period and the\nuse of four economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes. Credit losses estimated in our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period are\nsensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios, we use a combination of\nquantitative macroeconomic models, other\nmeasures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment to forecast the\ndistribution of economic outcomes over the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nEach scenario is then given an associated\nprobability (weight) to represent our current\nexpectation within that distribution over the\nforecast period. This process is informed by\ncurrent economic conditions, expected business\ncycle evolution and the expert judgment of\nPNC\u2019s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter,\nthe scenarios are presented to RAC for\napproval, and the committee also approves CECL\nscenarios\u2019 weights for use for the current\nreporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended June\n30, 2023 reflect a slight increase in downside\nrisk compared to December 31, 2022. The\ncurrent outlook considers, among other\nfactors, the ongoing inflationary pressures\nand the corresponding tightening of monetary\npolicy and credit availability. Our most-\nlikely expectation at June 30, 2023 is that\nthe U.S. economy will be impacted by a mild\nrecession starting in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate.

Growth then drops to (0.1)% in 2024,\nbefore jumping to 1.9% in 2025. In line with\nstronger-than-anticipated job growth at the\nstart of 2023, the weighted-average projection\nof the unemployment rate is expected to end\n2023 at 4.0%, down from the 4.9% assumed at\nDecember 31, 2022. In line with the slowing in\noverall economic activity, the weighted-\naverage unemployment rate is expected to\nincrease through the end of 2023 and 2024,\nreaching 4.9% by year-end 2024, and gradually\nimproving to 4.5% by the fourth quarter of\n2025.\n\nThe current state of the economy reflects an\nenvironment with receding pandemic-related\nrisks and labor-related supply chain\npressures. However, heightened uncertainty\nremains due to structural and secular changes\nfostered by the pandemic for certain sectors\nof the economy combined with inflation and\nrising interest rates. As such, for both our\ncommercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC\nidentified and performed significant analysis\naround segments impacted by such uncertainties\nto ensure our reserves are adequate, given our\ncurrent macroeconomic expectations.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis, we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for the specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nappropriately reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nSee the following for additional details

performed an\nevaluation under the supervision of and with\nthe participation of our management, including\nthe Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and the Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and of changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nBased on that evaluation, our Chairman,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and our\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)\nwere effective as of June 30, 2023, and that\nthere has been no change in PNC\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the second quarter of 2023 that has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting.\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d

expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other\ntrade policies of the U.S. and its global\ntrading partners,\n\n\u2013 A continuation of turmoil in the banking\nindustry, responsive measures to mitigate and\nmanage it and related supervisory and\nregulatory actions and costs,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount the potential impact of legal and\nregulatory contingencies. These statements are\nbased on our views that:\n\n\u2013 The economy continued to expand in the first\nhalf of 2023, but economic growth is slowing\nin response to the ongoing Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy tightening to slow inflation.\nThis has led to large increases in both short-\nand long-term interest rates. The housing\nmarket stabilized in the first half of 2023 as\nthe Federal Reserve signaled a potential end\nto its federal funds rate hiking cycle.\nHowever, given the upward trajectory in\nmortgage rates and declining affordability,\nPNC continues to expect slower activity in the\nhousing market in the second half of 2023 with\na recovery in early 2024 as the Federal\nReserve starts cutting the federal funds rate.\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s baseline outlook is for a mild\nrecession starting in late 2023 or early 2024,\nwith a smaller contraction in real GDP of less\nthan 1%, lasting into mid-2024. The\nunemployment rate will increase in the second\nhalf of this year, ending 2023 at above 4%,\nand then peak slightly above 5% in early 2025.\nInflation will slow with weaker demand, moving\nback to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% objective by\nthis time next year.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain\nbetween 5.25% and 5.50% through March 2024,\nwhen it is expected that the Federal Reserve\nwill cut rates in response to the recession.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding minimum capital levels, including an\nSCB established by the Federal Reserve Board\nin connection with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nCCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations, and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices, and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 41\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC\u2019s control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2022 Form 10-K\nand subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

Our retail branch network is\nlocated coast-to-coast. We also have strategic\ninternational offices in fourcountries outside\nthe U.S.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  1 A                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING P OLICIES                         \n                                              \nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of the parent company and its\nsubsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned,\ncertain partnership interests and VIEs.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to state\nfairly our results for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the full year or any\nother interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2022 Form 10-K. These interim consolidated\nfinancial statements serve to update our 2022\nForm 10-K and may not include all information\nand Notes necessary to constitute a complete\nset of financial statements. There have been\nchanges to certain of our accounting policies\nas disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K due to the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASU\n2022-02) in the first quarter of 2023. The\nupdated policies impacted by this adoption are\nincluded in this Note 1. Reference is made to\nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form\n10-K for a detailed description of all other\nsignificant accounting policies.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Under the\nCARES Act credit reporting rules, certain\nloans modified due to pandemic related\nhardships are not being reported as past due\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period. The CARES Act credit\nreporting rules expire in the third quarter of\n2023.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\n48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method over the\ncontractual life. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method,\nover the contractual life of the loan. The\nprocessing fee received for loans originated\nthrough PPP lending under the CARES Act is\ndeferred and accreted into Net interest income\nusing the effective yield method, over the\ncontractual life of the loan. Loans under the\nfair value option are reported at their fair\nvalue, with any changes to fair value reported\nas Noninterest income on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement, and are excluded from the\nmeasurement of ALLL.\n\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination ( i.e. , PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe acquisition date. PNC considers a variety\nof factors in connection with the\nidentification of more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality, including but\nnot limited to nonperforming status,\ndelinquency, risk ratings and other\nqualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that are attributable, at least in\npart, to credit quality are recognized through\na charge to the provision for credit losses\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nare recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL .\n\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\n\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, or when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to measure the loan at the estimated\nfair value of collateral (less costs to sell\nif sale or foreclosure of the property is\nexpected).\n\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02,\nwhich eliminates the accounting guidance for\nTDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2022 Form 10-K for a description of our\naccounting policies for TDRs that were in\neffect prior to adoption.\n\nLoan modifications to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, or FDMs, result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include\nprincipal forgiveness, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, payment delays,\nrepayment plans or combinations thereof. FDMs\ncontinue to be subject to our existing\nnonaccrual policies. Expected losses or\nrecoveries on FDMs have been factored into the\nALLL estimates for each loan class under the\nmethodologies described in this Note. Refer to\nNote 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit\nLosses for more information on FDMs.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and\nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL\nand additional details on the composition of\nour loan portfolio:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note 1,\n\n\u2022 Allowance for Credit Losses section of this\nNote 1,\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses in this Report, and\n\n\u2022 Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases\n\nThe matrix that follows summarizes our\npolicies for classifying certain loans as\nnonperforming loans and/or discontinuing the\naccrual of loan interest income.\n                                              \n  Commercial                                  \n                        \u2022\u00a0\u00a0Loans

generally charge-off commercial (commercial\nand industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well-secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform. For commercial\nloans and leases less than a defined dollar\nthreshold, balances are generally charged-off\nin full after 180 days for loans and 120 days\nfor leases.\n\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell if the\nfair value is lower than the amortized cost\nbasis of the loan outstanding and the\ndelinquency of the loan, combined with other\nrisk factors such as bankruptcy or lien\nposition, indicates that the loan (or a\nportion thereof) is uncollectible as per our\nhistorical experience. These nonperforming\nloans would also be charged-off when the\ncollateral has been repossessed. We charge-off\nsecured consumer loans no later than 180 days\npast due. Most consumer loans and lines of\ncredit, not secured by automobiles or\nresidential real estate, are charged-off once\nthey have reached 120-180 days past due.\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected,\nlimited to amounts previously charged-off.\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, depending on\nwhether the accrued interest has been\nincorporated into the ACL estimates, as\ndiscussed in the Accrued Interest section of\nthis Note 1, the accrued and uncollected\ninterest is either reversed through Net\ninterest income (if a CECL reserve is not\nmaintained for accrued interest) or charged-\noff against the allowance (if a CECL reserve\nis maintained for accrued interest), except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged-off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance. Payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as fee and interest income. For\ncertain consumer loans, the receipt of\ninterest payments is recognized as interest\nincome on a cash basis. Cash basis income\nrecognition is applied if a loan\u2019s amortized\ncost basis is deemed fully collectible and the\nloan has performed for at least six months.\nFor loans modified due to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, payments\nare applied based upon their contractual terms\nunless the related loan is deemed\nnonperforming. Loans modified due to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally included in nonperforming and\nnonaccrual loans if they are not government\ninsured or guaranteed. However, after a\nreasonable period of time, generally six\nmonths, in which the loan performs under\nmodified terms and meets other performance\nindicators, it is returned to\nperforming/accruing status. This return to\nperforming/accruing status demonstrates that\nthe bank expects to collect all of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nLoan modifications granted\n\n50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nresulting from (i) borrowers that have been\ndischarged from personal liability through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally\nreaffirmed their loan obligations to us, and\n(ii) borrowers that are not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the modified terms are not\nreturned to accrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accrual status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collection of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal are not returned to accrual. When a\nnonperforming loan is returned to accrual\nstatus, it is then considered a performing\nloan.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\nresidential and commercial real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information on\nFDMs, nonperforming assets and credit quality\nindicators related to our loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL is based on historical loss\nexperience, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, equipment finance leases,\nother financial assets and unfunded lending\nrelated commitments, for the estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures as\nof the balance sheet date. The remaining\ncontractual term of assets in scope of CECL is\nestimated considering contractual maturity\ndates, prepayment expectations, utilization or\ndraw expectations and any contractually\nembedded extension options that do not allow\nus to unilaterally cancel the extension\noptions. For products without a fixed\ncontractual maturity date ( e.g ., credit\ncards), we rely on historical payment behavior\nto determine the length of the paydown or\ndefault time period.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long-run\naverage expected losses, where applicable and\n(iii) the long-run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term. For\nall assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable.\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have currently determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, analysis\nfrom PNC economists and management judgment.\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long-run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long-run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically one to three years, if not\nimmediate.\nThe long-run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long-run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio and,\ntherefore, do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 51\nSee the following sections related to loans\nand unfunded lending related commitments for\ndetails about specific methodologies.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan, loan\nsegment or lease. We also consider the impact\nof prepayments and amortization on contractual\nmaturity in our expected loss estimates. We\nuse historical credit loss information,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables for the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\ncoupled with analytical methods, to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan, loan segment or\nlease. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario and\nthe long-run average period, and combined to\ngenerate expected loss estimates by scenario.\nThe following matrix provides key credit risk\ncharacteristics that we use to estimate these\nrisk parameters.\n                                              \n  Loan       Probabi\u2026    Loss       Exposure  \n  Class      of

forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong-run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long-run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate by loan class. We then add or deduct\nany qualitative components and other\nadjustments, such as individually assessed\nloans, to produce the ALLL. See the\nIndividually Assessed Component and\nQualitative Component discussions that follow\nin this Note 1 for additional information\nabout those adjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes.\nEffective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our\nuse of a discounted cash flow methodology, and\nwe now use a pooled expected loss methodology\nbased upon the quantification of risk\nparameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan\nor loan segment. See Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies in our 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndescription of our use of a discounted cash\nflow methodology prior to January 1, 2023.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold\nare reserved for under a pooled basis.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged-off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 53\nattributable to such risks. The ACL also takes\ninto account factors that may not be directly\nmeasured in the determination of individually\nassessed or pooled reserves. Such qualitative\nfactors may include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities section of Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K and\nthe Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note 1 for additional information on our\nnonaccrual and charge-off policies.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022\nForm 10-K for a description of the accounting\npolicies related to the applicable reserves on\naccrued interest for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023.\n\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition, as the\nestimated expected credit loss of the\noutstanding balance or par value, based on the\nmethodologies described previously for loans\nand securities. In accordance with CECL, the\nallowance recognized at acquisition is added\nto the acquisition date purchase price to\ndetermine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable ( e.g. , unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan\nand Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for\nthe key credit risk characteristics for\nunfunded lending related commitments. The\nallowance for unfunded lending related\ncommitments is recorded as a liability on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to\nthis reserve are included in the provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022 Provides                   \n                 optional                     \n                 expedients                   \n                 and                          \n                 exceptions     \u2022 ASU         \n                 for            2020-04 was   \n                 applying       adopted       \n                 generally      March 12,     \n                 accepted       2020.

The\ncomparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $\n282million and $ 144million, respectively.\nThese amounts are included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. Of our total securities\nportfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 141million for securities\navailable for sale, primarily related to non-\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities\nand $ 7million for securities held to maturity\nat June 30, 2023. The comparable amounts at\nDecember 31, 2022 were $ 142million and $\n7million, respectively.\n\n(d) Held to maturity securities transferred\nfrom available for sale are included in held\nto maturity at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer. The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 4.7billion at June 30, 2023\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Investment securities at June 30,\n2023 included $ 0.2billion of net unsettled\npurchases that represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for June 30, 2022 was $\n0.4billion of net unsettled purchases.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At June 30, 2023, the allowance for\ninvestment securities was $ 148million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2022 was $ 149million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the methodologies used to\ndetermine the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nAt June 30, 2023, AOCI included pretax losses\nof $ 301million from derivatives that hedged\nthe purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 37 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.

A variety of solutions are offered\nto borrowers, including loan modifications\nthat may result in principal forgiveness,\ninterest rate reductions, term extensions,\npayment delays, repayment plans or\ncombinations thereof:\n\n\u2022 Principal forgiveness includes principal and\naccrued interest forgiveness.\n\n\u2022 Interest rate reductions include\nmodifications where the interest rate is\nreduced and/or interest is deferred.\n\n\u2022 Term extensions extend the original\ncontractual maturity date of the loan.\n\n\u2022 Payment delays consist of modifications\nwhere we expect to collect contractual amounts\ndue, but that result in a delay in the receipt\nof payments specified under the original loan\nterms. We generally consider payment delays to\nbe insignificant when the delay is three\nmonths or less.\n\n\u2022 Repayment plans are offered for some of our\ncredit card and unsecured line of credit\nproducts, which provide for a reduced payment\nand interest rate for a specific period of\ntime.\n\nAdditionally, modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir obligations to us, and those that enter\ninto trial modifications.\n\nFDMs exclude loans held for sale and loans\naccounted for under the fair value option. Our\ndisclosed FDM population also excludes\ngovernment insured or guaranteed education\nloans as loss mitigation activities for these\nloans are either required by law or they are\nconsidered separate from PNC\u2019s loss mitigation\ntreatments. Commercial loans with an appraised\nvalue of collateral that exceeds the loan\nvalue, loans with guarantor support, and\nresidential mortgage government insured or\nguaranteed loans are included in our disclosed\npopulation of FDMs when those loan\nmodifications are granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty.\n\nRefer to Note 1 Accounting Policies for\nadditional information around our adoption of\nASU 2022-02.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 67\nThe following table presents the amortized\ncost basis, as of June 30, 2023, of FDMs\ngranted during the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023:\nTable 46: Loan Modifications Granted to\nBorrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\n(a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) At June 30, 2023, there were $ 0.1billion\nof unfunded lending related commitments\nassociated with FDMs.\n(b) Includes loans where we have received\nnotification that a borrower has filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy relief, but specific\ninstructions as to the terms of the relief\nhave not been formally ruled upon by the\ncourt.

In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 53.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.5billion at June\n30, 2023 and $ 3.4billion at December 31,\n2022, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages which are measured at fair value.\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. MSRs are subject to\nchanges in value from actual or expected\nprepayment of the underlying loans and\ndefaults, as well as market driven changes in\ninterest rates. We manage this risk by\neconomically hedging the fair value of MSRs\nwith securities, derivative instruments and\nresale agreements, which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 5 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 55 and 56. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 73\nThe

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 15 Fair Value in our 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nFor more information on the valuation\nmethodologies used to measure assets and\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, see Note 15 Fair Value in our 2022 Form\n10-K.

Derivatives represent contracts\nbetween parties that usually require little or\nno initial net investment and result in one\nparty delivering cash or another type of asset\nto the other party based on a notional amount\nand an underlying as specified in the\ncontract.\n\nDerivative transactions are often measured in\nterms of notional amount, but this amount is\ngenerally not exchanged and it is not recorded\non the balance sheet. The notional amount is\nthe basis to which the underlying is applied\nto determine required payments under the\nderivative contract. The underlying is a\nreferenced interest rate, security price,\ncredit spread or other index. Residential and\ncommercial real estate loan commitments\nassociated with loans to be sold also qualify\nas derivative instruments.\n\nFor more information regarding derivatives see\nNote 1 Accounting Policies and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nT able 73 presents the notional and gross fair\nvalue amounts of all derivative assets and\nliabilities held by us.\n\nDuring the second quarter, in anticipation of\nLIBOR\u2019s cessation on June 30, 2023, LIBOR-\nindexed interest-rate swap contracts with\ncentral clearing counterparties were subject\nto a conversion process whereby an individual\nLIBOR swap contract was exchanged for a SOFR\nreplacement swap contract, along with one or\nmore overlay swap contracts replicating the\nfinal LIBOR cash flows on the original swap\ncontract. The swap contracts exchanged were\nsubstantially economically equivalent.\nConversion-related valuation differences were\nsettled in cash on the conversion dates and\nwere not material. The SOFR replacement and\noverlay swaps are considered separate\ncontracts, and the overlay swaps will result\nin a gross-up of the notional amounts\npresented until those swaps mature upon\nsettlement of the final LIBOR payment. The\nmajority of overlay swaps will mature in the\nthird quarter of 2023.\n\nTable 73: Total Gross Derivatives (a)\n                                              \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                     \u2026              \u2026         \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026              1    \n                                              \n                          \u2026    $              \n                          \u2026    $         1    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026    $         1    \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026                   \n                          \u2026              6    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                                              \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                                              \n                          \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                          \u2026    $         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                               $         \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Centrally cleared derivatives are settled\nin cash daily and result in no derivative\nasset or derivative liability being recognized\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet .\n\n(b) Included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(c) Included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(d) Represents primarily swaps.\n\n(e) At June 30, 2023, the gross-up of the\nnotional amounts due to overlay swap contracts\nfor fair value and cash flow hedges were $\n18.8billion and $ 47.0billion, respectively.\n\n(f) Includes both residential and commercial\nmortgage banking activities.\n\n(g) At June 30, 2023, the gross-up of the\nnotional amounts due to overlay swap contracts\nused for mortgage banking and customer-related\nactivities were $ 26.0billion and $\n423.0billion, respectively.\n\n(h) Futures contracts are settled in cash\ndaily and result in no derivative asset or\nderivative liability being recognized on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 91\nAll derivatives are carried on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.\nDerivative balances are presented on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis\ntaking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand, when appropriate, any related cash\ncollateral exchanged with counterparties.\nFurther discussion regarding the offsetting\nrights associated with these legally\nenforceable master netting agreements is\nincluded in the Offsetting and Counterparty\nCredit Risk section of this Note 12. Any\nnonperformance risk, including credit risk, is\nincluded in the determination of the estimated\nnet fair value of the derivatives.\n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk as part of our\nasset and liability risk management activities\nare designated as accounting hedges.\nDerivatives hedging the risks associated with\nchanges in the fair value of assets or\nliabilities are considered fair value hedges,\nderivatives hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are considered cash\nflow hedges and derivatives hedging a net\ninvestment in a foreign subsidiary are\nconsidered net investment hedges. Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow June 30, 2023, we\nexpect to reclassify net derivative losses of\n$ 1.5billion pretax, or $ 1.2billion after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to June 30, 2023. As\nof June 30, 2023, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\n\n92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail regarding

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting and counterparty credit risk, see\nNote 16 Financial Derivatives in our 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nTable 77 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The\ntable includes cash collateral held or pledged\nunder legally enforceable master netting\nagreements. The table also includes the fair\nvalue of any securities collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements.

To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions.

Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of reasonably\npossible losses or ranges of reasonably\npossible losses, whether in excess of any\nrelated accrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability, for disclosed legal\nproceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K and in\nNote 13 Legal Proceedings in our first quarter\n2023 Form 10-Q (such prior disclosure referred\nto as \u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed\nMatters where we are able to estimate such\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses,\nas of June 30, 2023, we estimate that it is\nreasonably possible that we could incur losses\nin excess of related accrued liabilities, if\nany, in an aggregate amount less than $\n300million. The estimates included in this\namount are based on our analysis of currently\navailable information and are subject to\nsignificant judgment and a variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties. As new\ninformation is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form\n10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate\nthe losses that are reasonably possible to be\nincurred or ranges of such losses with respect\nto some of the matters disclosed, and the\naggregate estimated amount provided above does\nnot include an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we would record the\namount of related insurance recoveries that\nare deemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\n96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn April 2023, in United Services Automobile\nAssociation v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case No.\n2:21-cv-246) (the \u201cthird Texas case\u201d) and the\ncase for PNC\u2019s patent infringement\ncounterclaims (originally asserted in United\nServices Automobile Association v. PNC Bank\nN.A. (Case No. 2:20-cv-319)) (the \u201cfirst Texas\ncase\u201d) (together, the \u201csecond consolidated\ncases\u201d), USAA noticed a cross-appeal to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\nregarding the final judgment in the second\nconsolidated cases. This appeal was\nconsolidated with PNC\u2019s previously noticed\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit regarding the final judgment\nin the second consolidated cases as United\nServices Automobile Association v. PNC Bank\nN.A. (Case No. 23-1639).\n\nIn May and June 2023, USAA appealed the Final\nWritten Decisions of the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board that concluded that the claims in\nthree of the patents originally at issue in\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-110) and the\nfirst Texas case (together, the \u201cfirst\nconsolidated cases\u201d) and in United Services\nAutomobile Association v. BBVA USA (Case No.\n2:21-cv-311) were unpatentable. Because of\nUSAA\u2019s case narrowing in the first\nconsolidated cases, only one of these three\npatents was presented to the jury in the first\nconsolidated cases.\n\nAlso in May 2023, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard entered its Final Written Decision\nconcluding that most of the claims of one of\nthe patents presented to the jury in the third\nTexas case were unpatentable and other claims\nwere not unpatentable. In June 2023, the\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board entered its\nFinal Written Decision concluding that all of\nthe claims of the other patent subject to\ninter partes review, but not ultimately\npresented to the jury in the third Texas Case,\nwere unpatentable.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 97\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices.

Under the proposal, the FDIC\nwould collect from PNC, along with other BHCs\nand insured depository institutions, special\nassessments at an annual rate of 12.5 basis\npoints of PNC\u2019s uninsured deposits reported as\nof December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the\nfirst $5 billion), over eight quarterly\nassessment periods, beginning after the first\nquarter 2024. We expect the FDIC will enact a\nspecial deposit insurance assessment in the\nsecond half of 2023 that will significantly\nincrease our FDIC deposit insurance costs.\nBased on the current proposal, PNC estimates\nour total cost to be approximately $\n468million pre-tax, or $ 370million after-tax,\nwhich would be incurred in the quarter the\nFDIC finalizes the rule. The total cost and\ntiming is subject to change pending the\nassessment\u2019s finalization.\n\nProposed Expanded Risk-Based Capital Rules\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC,\nand FDIC proposed for public comment an\ninteragency rule to implement the final\ncomponents of the Basel III framework that\nwould significantly revise the capital\nrequirements for large banking organizations,\nincluding PNC and PNC Bank. The proposed rule\nwill apply an expanded risk-based approach\nwhich leverages the Basel rules, including the\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets, in\naddition to the current U.S. standardized\napproach. In addition, this proposal would\nalign the regulatory capital elements and\nrequired deductions for Category III banking\norganizations such as PNC and PNC Bank with\nthose currently applicable to Category I and\nII banking organizations. PNC and PNC Bank\nwould be required to recognize most elements\nof AOCI in regulatory capital and deduct from\nCET1 capital, among other items, mortgage\nservicing assets and deferred tax assets that\nindividually exceed 10 percent of CET1 capital\nor in the aggregate with other threshold items\nthat exceed 15 percent of CET1 capital . PNC\nand PNC Bank would be required to calculate\ntheir risk-based capital ratios under the\nexisting\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                      10-Q 103\nstandardized approach and the expanded risk-\nbased approach and would be subject to the\nlower of the two resulting ratios for their\nrisk-based capital minimums and buffer\nrequirements, including the SCB. The proposed\neffective date is July 1, 2025, with certain\nprovisions\u2014including the recognition of AOCI\nelements in regulatory capital and the\nincrease in risk-weighted assets due to the\nexpanded risk-based approach\u2014having a three-\nyear phase-in period.\n\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n

Average\nbalances of securities are based on amortized\nhistorical cost (excluding adjustments to fair\nvalue, which are included in other assets).\nAverage balances for certain loans and\nborrowed funds accounted for at fair value are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes\nin fair value recorded in Noninterest income.\n\n(b) Loan fees for the three months ended June\n30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were $44 million\nand $38 million, respectively.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.
