See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report for additional\ninformation regarding our regulatory matters.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our\npermissible activities and investments, impose\nconditions and requirements on the products\nand services we offer and the manner in which\nthey are offered and sold, and require\ncompliance with protections for loan, deposit,\nbrokerage, fiduciary, investment management\nand other customers, among other things. They\nalso restrict our ability to repurchase stock\nor pay dividends, or to receive dividends from\nour bank subsidiary, and impose capital\nadequacy and liquidity requirements. The\nconsequences of noncompliance with these, or\nother applicable laws or regulations, can\ninclude substantial monetary and nonmonetary\nsanctions.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive\nsupervision and periodic examination by, among\nother regulatory bodies, the Federal Reserve\nand the OCC. These examinations consider not\nonly compliance with applicable laws,\nregulations and supervisory policies of\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nthe agency, but also capital levels, asset\nquality, risk management effectiveness, the\nability and performance of management and the\nboard of directors, the effectiveness of\ninternal controls and internal audit function,\nearnings, liquidity and various other factors.\n\nThe results of examination activity by any of\nour federal bank regulators potentially can\nresult in the imposition of significant\nlimitations on our activities and growth.\nThese regulatory agencies generally have broad\ndiscretion to impose restrictions and\nlimitations on the operations of a regulated\nentity and take enforcement action, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements,\nagainst a regulated entity where the relevant\nagency determines, among other things, that\nthe operations of the regulated entity or any\nof its subsidiaries fail to comply with\napplicable law or regulations, are conducted\nin an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent\nan unfair or deceptive act or practice. This\nsupervisory framework, including the\nexamination reports and supervisory ratings\n(which are not publicly available) of the\nagencies, could materially impact the conduct,\ngrowth and profitability of our operations.\n\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws, including the laws\nrelating to fair lending and prohibiting\nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\nin connection with the offer, sale or\nprovision of consumer financial products or\nservices, and for enforcing such laws with\nrespect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The\nresults of the CFPB\u2019s examinations (which are\nnot publicly available) also can result in\nrestrictions or limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity as well as enforcement\nactions against a regulated entity, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements.\n\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC\nby virtue of our status as a public company\nand by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature\nof some of our businesses. Our businesses with\noperations outside the U.S. also are subject\nto regulation by appropriate authorities in\nthe foreign jurisdictions in which they do\nbusiness.\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our\nrelationships and good standing with\nregulators are of fundamental importance to\nthe operation and growth of our businesses.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and\nother domestic and foreign regulators have\nbroad enforcement powers, and certain of the\nregulators have the power to approve, deny, or\nrefuse to act upon our applications or notices\nto conduct new activities, acquire or divest\nbusinesses, assets or deposits, expand our\noperations geographically, or reconfigure\nexisting operations.\n\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a\nhigh level of regulatory focus are compliance\nwith the BSA and anti-money laundering laws,\ncapital and liquidity management (including\nstress testing), the structure and\neffectiveness of enterprise risk management\nframeworks, the management of risks associated\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, the protection of\nconfidential customer information, cyber\nsecurity, the oversight of arrangements with\nthird-party vendors and suppliers, and\ncompliance with fair lending and other\nconsumer protection laws and regulations,\nincluding those governing retail sales\npractices, fee disclosures, unfair, deceptive\nor abusive acts or practices, collection\npractices, and protections for military\nservice members and individuals in bankruptcy.\n\nNew legislation, changes in rules promulgated\nby federal financial regulators, other federal\nand state regulatory authorities and self-\nregulatory organizations, or changes in the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing laws\nand rules, may directly affect the operations\nand profitability of our businesses. We\nanticipate new legislative and regulatory\ninitiatives over the next several years,\nfocused specifically on banking and other\nfinancial services in which we are engaged.\nLegislative and regulatory developments to\ndate, as well as those that come in the\nfuture, have had and are likely to continue to\nhave an impact on the conduct of our business.\nThe more detailed description of the\nsignificant regulations to which we are\nsubject included in this Report is based on\ncurrent laws and regulations and is subject to\npotentially material change. See also the\nadditional information included as Risk\nFactors in Item 1A of this Report discussing\nthe impact of financial regulatory initiatives\non the regulatory environment for us and the\nfinancial services industry.\n\nThe profitability of our businesses could also\nbe affected by rules and regulations that\nimpact the business and financial sectors in\ngeneral, including changes to the laws\ngoverning taxation, antitrust regulation,\nelectronic commerce, data security and\nprivacy.\n\nThere are numerous rules governing the\nregulation of financial services institutions\nand their holding companies. Accordingly, the\nfollowing discussion is general in nature and\ndoes not purport to be complete or to describe\nall of the laws, regulations and policies that\napply to us. To a substantial extent, the\npurpose of the regulation and supervision of\nfinancial services institutions and their\nholding companies is not to protect our\nshareholders and our non-customer creditors,\nbut rather to protect our customers (including\ndepositors) and the financial markets and\nfinancial system in general.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                   Form 10-K 3\n                                              \n  COVID-19 Relief                             \n                                              \nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S.\nGovernment has taken a wide variety of actions\nin order to aid businesses and consumers\nfinancially impacted by COVID-19, facilitate\nthe orderly functioning of financial markets,\nand assist banking organizations in being able\nto meet the credit and other banking needs of\ntheir customers and communities.\n\nThe CARES Act, as subsequently amended by the\nPPP and Health Care Enhancement Act and the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, authorizes\nthe SBA and the Treasury Department to expend\nup to $943 billion to support the issuance by\nSBA-approved lenders of first-draw loans of up\nto $10 million and second-draw loans of up to\n$2 million to small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that meet certain size and other\neligibility requirements under the PPP.\nBorrowers may use the proceeds of a PPP loan\nonly for specified purposes (such as meeting\npayroll) and borrowers can have the loan\npartially or fully forgiven (and repaid by the\nSBA) to the extent the borrower expends funds\nduring a limited period following receipt of\nthe loan proceeds for payroll costs or other\nspecified expenses. Eligible businesses may\napply for a first-or second-draw PPP loan\nuntil March 31, 2021. Borrowers and lenders\nare required to provide certain certifications\nand documentation, and conduct certain\nreviews, in connection with PPP loan\napplications as specified in the PPP rules and\nassociated guidance, which are subject to\nchange and further clarification by the SBA\nand Treasury. PNC Bank is participating in the\nPPP.\n\nThe CARES Act also permits residential and\nmultifamily mortgage borrowers with federally\nbacked mortgages to request payment\nforbearance for up to six months or 30 days,\nrespectively, under a streamlined process if\nthe borrower is experiencing a financial\nhardship due to the COVID-19 national\nemergency. The borrower may request an\nextension of these forbearance periods, for up\nto an additional six months for residential\nborrowers and 60 days for multifamily\nborrowers. Residential mortgage borrowers with\nfederally backed mortgages, and tenants of\nmultifamily borrowers that receive forbearance\nunder these provisions, also benefit from\ncertain foreclosure and eviction protections.\nFor these purposes, federally backed mortgages\ninclude those guaranteed or insured by the\nFNMA, FHLMC, FHA or VA. Under revised Federal\nHousing Finance Agency policies, servicers of\nFNMA and FHLMC-guaranteed residential\nmortgages, such as PNC Bank, will no longer\nhave an obligation to advance scheduled\npayments on a mortgage loan that is in a\nmortgage-backed security once the servicer has\nadvanced four months of missed payments on the\nloan. Various states and municipalities also\nhave imposed new foreclosure and eviction\nlimitations of varying scope and degree in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES\nAct also provides consumers certain temporary\nprotections up to 120 days after the\ntermination of the COVID-19 national emergency\nagainst the reporting of negative credit\ninformation to a credit reporting agency as a\nresult of loan accommodations provided.\n\nThe CARES Act, as modified by the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, permits financial\ninstitutions to temporarily suspend the\nrequirements under GAAP to categorize loan\nmodifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nas a TDR through the earlier of 60 days after\nthe national emergency termination or January\n2, 2022, and the determination of such a loan\nmodification as being a TDR. The federal\nbanking agencies, along with the CFPB and the\nNational Credit Union Administration, and\nseparately the FFIEC, released statements\nthat, among other things, clarify the\nagencies\u2019 and FFIEC\u2019s views on TDRs, including\nthe interaction between agency guidance on\nTDRs and the CARES Act, and prudent risk\nmanagement and consumer protection principles.\nWe are following the provisions within the\nCARES Act, as amended, and the agencies\u2019 and\nFFIEC\u2019s statements when evaluating our\nCOVID-19 related loan modification requests.\n\nFederal Reserve Liquidity Facilities. To help\npromote the flow of credit and the orderly\nfunctioning of financial markets, the Federal\nReserve in 2020 established a number of new\nlending or liquidity facilities using its\nemergency lending authority under section\n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Many of\nthese facilities are or were supported by\nfunding provided by the Treasury Department,\neither from the Emergency Stabilization Fund\nor under the CARES Act. Certain of these\nfacilities (the Primary Market Corporate\nCredit Facility, Secondary Market Corporate\nCredit Facility, Municipal Liquidity Facility,\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and\nMain Street Lending Facility) have ceased\nmaking or purchasing new extensions of credit.\nThe following emergency facilities continue to\nmake or purchase new extensions of credit:\n\n\u2022 Commercial Paper Funding Facility, which\npurchases highly rated unsecured and asset-\nbacked commercial paper issued by eligible\nU.S. issuers;\n\n\u2022 Paycheck Protection Program Lending\nFacility, which provides lenders funding\nsecured by SBA-guaranteed loans made under the\nPPP described above;\n\n\u2022 Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which\nprovides secured funding to broker-dealers\nthat are registered as primary dealers with\nthe Federal Reserve in exchange for a broad\nrange of collateral; and\n\n\u2022 Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility,\nwhich provides liquidity to money market\nmutual funds by lending to U.S. banking\nentities in exchange for highly-rated\ncollateral acquired from money market mutual\nfunds.\n\nIn October 2020, the Federal banking agencies\nfinalized rules to encourage banking\norganizations to use the Money Market Mutual\nFund Liquidity Facility and Paycheck\nProtection Program Liquidity Facility. Under\nthe rules, banking organizations may exclude\nfrom leverage and risk-based capital\nrequirements any eligible assets sold or\npledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-\nrecourse basis as part of these programs, and\nthey are required to neutralize the effect\nunder the LCR of participating in these\nprograms. The banking\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nagencies also clarified that, consistent with\nthe CARES Act, covered loans originated by a\nbanking organization under the PPP will\nreceive a zero percent risk weight for\nregulatory capital purposes, even if not\npledged to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, in March 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced changes to its discount\nwindow lending for insured depository\ninstitutions, such as PNC Bank. These changes\npermit insured depository institutions to\nborrow from the discount window, on a fully\ncollateralized basis, for periods of up to 90\ndays, with such loans being prepayable and\nrenewable by the borrowing institution on a\ndaily basis. These changes, which will remain\nin effect until the Federal Reserve announces\notherwise, provide insured depository\ninstitutions additional tools for managing\ntheir liquidity profile, including for\npurposes of the LCR. The Federal Reserve must\npublicly disclose the details (including the\nname of the borrower or counterparty) of\ndiscount window transactions and transactions\nconducted by facilities established by the\nFederal Reserve on a delayed basis.\n\nThe Federal banking agencies, CFPB, SEC, and\nCFTC have issued other rules, guidance,\nstatements, orders or other actions to, among\nother things, facilitate the continued\nprovision of financial services, encourage\nfinancial institutions to work with customers\naffected by the pandemic, and reduce\noperational or regulatory challenges resulting\nfrom the pandemic and the private-sector and\ngovernmental actions designed to mitigate its\neffects. These actions and statements, among\nothers, clarified when appraisals or\nevaluations are required for real estate-\nsecured transactions and allowed required\nappraisals and evaluations to be deferred in\ncertain circumstances, encouraged banking\norganizations to use their capital and\nliquidity buffers to continue to provide\ncredit to customers and support the smooth\nfunctioning of markets, and encouraged\nfinancial institutions to make available\nsmall-dollar loans to consumers and small\nbusinesses affected by COVID-19.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation and Supervision          \n                                              \nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress\nTesting and Capital Planning . PNC and PNC\nBank are subject to the regulatory capital\nrequirements established by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC, respectively. The\nfoundation of the agencies\u2019 regulatory capital\nrules is the international regulatory capital\nframework developed by the Basel Committee,\nthe international body responsible for\ndeveloping global regulatory standards for\nbanking organizations for consideration and\nadoption by national jurisdictions. The\nregulatory capital rules establish minimum\nrequirements for the ratio of a banking\norganization\u2019s regulatory capital to its risk-\nweighted assets, referred to as risk-based\ncapital requirements, as well as for the ratio\nof its regulatory capital to measures of\nassets and other exposures, referred to as\nleverage capital requirements. The agencies\u2019\nregulatory capital rules have undergone\nsignificant change since 2013, when the\nagencies adopted final rules to implement the\nBasel Committee\u2019s international regulatory\ncapital framework, known as \u201cBasel III\u201d, as\nwell as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nAct.\n\nIn 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted\nrules to better tailor the application of\ntheir capital, liquidity and enhanced\nprudential requirements for banking\norganizations to the asset size and risk\nprofile (as measured by certain regulatory\nmetrics) of the banking organization (the\n\u201c2019 Tailoring Rules\u201d). Effective January 1,\n2020, the agencies\u2019 capital and liquidity\nrules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or\nmore in total assets into one of four\ncategories (Category I, Category II, Category\nIII and Category IV), with the most stringent\ncapital and liquidity requirements applying to\nCategory I firms and the least restrictive\nrequirements applying to Category IV firms.\nThe classification of any bank subsidiary of a\nBHC generally follows that of its parent BHC.\nPNC and PNC Bank currently are Category III\nfirms because PNC (i) has more than $250\nbillion, but less than $700 billion, in\nconsolidated total assets, (ii) is not\ndesignated as a GSIB, and (iii) has less than\n$75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity.\nPNC and PNC Bank would become a Category I or\nII institution, and subject to more stringent\ncapital and liquidity standards, if PNC were\nat some point in the future to have $700\nbillion or more in total consolidated assets,\nbe designated as a GSIB, or have $75 billion\nor more in cross-jurisdictional activity. As\nof December 31, 2020, PNC had cross-\njurisdictional activities for these purposes\nof $13.3 billion. PNC does not expect the\npending acquisition of BBVA, if consummated,\nwould affect its classification as a Category\nIII institution.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide\nregulatory capital into three components: CET1\ncapital, additional Tier 1 capital (which,\ntogether with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1\ncapital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is\ngenerally common stock, retained earnings, and\nqualifying minority interest less required\ndeductions. Prior to January 1, 2020, CET1\ncapital for PNC and PNC Bank also included\nAOCI related to both available for sale\nsecurities and pension and other post-\nretirement plans. Effective January 1, 2020,\nand as permitted by the 2019 Tailoring Rules,\nPNC and PNC Bank elected to exclude AOCI\nrelated to these items from CET1 capital.\nAdditional Tier 1 capital generally includes,\namong other things, perpetual preferred stock\nand qualifying minority interests, less\nrequired deductions. Tier 2 capital generally\ncomprises qualifying subordinated debt and,\nsubject to certain quantitative limits, ACL,\nless any required deductions from Tier 2\ncapital. The regulatory capital rules limit\nthe extent to which minority interests in\nconsolidated subsidiaries may be included in\nregulatory capital. Total capital is the sum\nof Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, less the\ndeductions required from Total capital.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules effective\nas of January 1, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank must\ndeduct investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets (in\neach case, net of associated deferred tax\nliabilities) from CET1 capital to the extent\nsuch items individually exceed 25% of the\ninstitution\u2019s adjusted CET1 capital. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank\u2019s\ninvestments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets did\nnot exceed this threshold.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                   Form 10-K 5\nThe agencies\u2019 capital rules also permit\nbanking organizations to elect to phase-in, on\na straight-line basis over a three-year\nperiod, the day-one regulatory capital effects\nof implementing the FASB\u2019s ASU 2016-13\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326), commonly referred to as the CECL\nstandard. PNC implemented the CECL standard\neffective January 1, 2020, but elected not to\nimplement the phase-in of the day-one\nregulatory capital effects of the standard.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for more detail on the CECL\nstandard. Separately, the Federal banking\nagencies adopted a rule that permits banking\norganizations that are subject to CECL during\n2020 to delay CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital is the change in retained earnings at\nadoption plus or minus 25% of the change in\nCECL ACL at the balance sheet date compared to\nCECL ACL at transition. For institutions\nelecting to utilize this CECL transition rule\nfor regulatory capital, the estimated CECL\nimpact is added to CET1 through December 31,\n2021, then phased-out over the following three\nyears. PNC and PNC Bank have elected this\nfive-year transition period effective March\n31, 2020, which impacts regulatory capital\nratios disclosed in this Report.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the\nstandardized approach for determining a\nbanking organization\u2019s risk-weighted assets\nfor purposes of calculating the risk-based\ncapital ratios. The standardized approach for\nrisk-weighted assets takes into account credit\nand market risk. To calculate risk-weighted\nassets under the standardized approach for\ncredit risk, the nominal dollar amounts of\nassets and credit equivalent amounts of off-\nbalance sheet items are generally multiplied\nby risk weights set forth in the rules, with\nthe risk weights increasing as the perceived\ncredit risk of the relevant asset or exposure\nincreases. For certain types of exposures,\nsuch as securitization exposures, the\nstandardized approach establishes one or more\nmethodologies that are to be used to calculate\nthe risk-weighted asset amount for the\nexposure. High volatility commercial real\nestate, past due, securitization and equity\nexposures, as well as MSRs and deferred tax\nassets that are not deducted from capital, are\ngenerally subject to higher risk weights than\nother types of exposures. Under the market\nrisk capital rule, risk-weighted asset amounts\nfor covered trading positions are determined\nbased on the calculation of VAR (including\nstressed value-at-risk), specific risk,\nincremental risk and comprehensive risk\namounts, as specified in the capital rules.\n\nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated\nusing the definition of capital under the\nagencies\u2019 Basel III capital rules and, for the\nrisk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted\nassets, as our Basel III regulatory capital\nratios.\n\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain\nminimum standards for the capital ratios of\nbanking organizations, including PNC and PNC\nBank. Banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital\nratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of\n8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-\nweighted assets, to be considered \u201cadequately\ncapitalized.\u201d In 2020, the Federal Reserve\nintroduced a CET1 SCB for BHCs subject to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process, such as PNC.\nThe SCB is calculated based on the difference\nbetween a firm\u2019s starting and minimum CET1\nratio (as projected by the Federal Reserve) in\nthe Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario\nduring the CCAR process, plus four quarters of\nthe organization\u2019s planned common stock\ndividends (expressed as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets), subject to a floor of 2.5%.\nBased on PNC\u2019s performance under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests as part of\nCCAR 2020, PNC\u2019s SCB for the period from the\nfourth quarter of 2020 through the third\nquarter of 2021 was set at 2.5%. While PNC\nBank is not subject to a SCB, PNC Bank is\nrequired to maintain a capital conservation\nbuffer in the form of CET1 equal to a fixed\n2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based\ncapital above the minimum risk-based capital\nratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case\nof PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the\ncase of PNC Bank) in order to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and repurchases of any\nTier 1 capital instrument, such as common and\nqualifying preferred stock, and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nAs a result, PNC and PNC Bank must maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 10.5% to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary incentive compensation\npayments. Because PNC\u2019s SCB is established as\npart of the CCAR process, and is based on\nPNC\u2019s projected performance (as determined by\nthe Federal Reserve) under the relevant\nSupervisory Severely Adverse scenario (which\ncan change, potentially materially, from\nstress test to stress test), PNC\u2019s SCB may\nvary, potentially materially, over time and,\nthus, PNC may be required to maintain capital\nabove these levels to avoid limitations on\ncapital distributions and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nIn addition, while a firm\u2019s SCB is typically\ndetermined as part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nannual CCAR process, the Federal Reserve has\nreserved the right to conduct supervisory\nstress tests, require a firm to submit a\nrevised capital plan, and calculate a firm\u2019s\nSCB, more frequently. BHCs subject to a SCB,\nsuch as PNC, generally may increase their\ncapital distributions without seeking prior\nFederal Reserve approval, provided the BHC\notherwise complies with its SCB and any other\napplicable capital or capital distribution\nrequirements. However, in light of ongoing\neconomic uncertainty related to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve has imposed\nspecial limitations on dividends and share\nrepurchases by CCAR-participating BHCs during\nthe first quarter of 2021 and these\nrestrictions may be continued in future\nquarters, potentially in modified form.\n\nFor Category III banking organizations (such\nas PNC and PNC Bank), these higher SCB or\ncapital conservation buffer levels above the\nregulatory minimums could be supplemented by a\ncountercyclical capital buffer of up to an\nadditional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. This\nbuffer is currently set at zero in the U.S. A\nFederal Reserve policy statement establishes\nthe framework and factors the Federal Reserve\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer.\nCovered banking\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\norganizations would generally have 12 months\nafter the announcement of any increase in the\ncountercyclical capital buffer to meet the\nincreased buffer requirement, unless the\nFederal Reserve determines to establish an\nearlier effective date. If the full\ncountercyclical buffer amount is implemented,\nPNC and PNC Bank would be required to maintain\na CET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier\n1 capital ratio of at least 11%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 13% to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary incentive compensation\npayments.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that\nbanking organizations maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to\naverage consolidated assets, referred to as\nthe leverage ratio, and require Category III\nbanking organizations to maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total\nleverage exposure, referred to as the SLR.\nTotal leverage exposure takes into account on-\nbalance sheet assets as well as certain off-\nbalance sheet items, including loan\ncommitments and potential future exposure\nunder derivative contracts. Banking\norganizations are required to maintain a\nminimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to\ntotal assets of 4.0%, and Category III banking\norganizations must maintain a minimum SLR of\n3.0%. As of December 31, 2020, the leverage\nand SLR ratios of PNC and PNC Bank were above\nthe required minimum level.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are not subject to the\nadditional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum\nlong-term debt requirement, minimum TLAC, or\nenhanced SLR requirements that apply to U.S.\nGSIBs.\n\nFailure to meet applicable capital\nrequirements could subject a banking\norganization to a variety of enforcement\nremedies available to the federal banking\nagencies, including a limitation on the\nability to pay dividends or repurchase shares,\nthe issuance of a capital directive to\nincrease capital and, in severe cases, the\ntermination of deposit insurance by the FDIC\nand the appointment of a conservator or\nreceiver. In some cases, the extent of these\npowers depends upon whether the institution in\nquestion is considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\n\u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d The thresholds\nat which an insured depository institution is\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d are based on (i)\nthe institution\u2019s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-\nbased capital ratios; (ii) the institution\u2019s\nleverage ratio; and (iii) for the definitions\nof \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cundercapitalized\u201d, the institution\u2019s SLR (if\napplicable). Generally, the smaller an\ninstitution\u2019s capital base in relation to its\nrisk-weighted or total assets, the greater the\nscope and severity of the agencies\u2019 powers.\nBusiness activities may also be affected by an\ninstitution\u2019s capital classification. For\nexample, as a financial holding company, PNC\nand PNC Bank must remain \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\n\nAt December 31, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the required ratios for\nclassification as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For\nadditional discussion of capital adequacy\nrequirements, including the levels of capital\nrequired to be considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\nsee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of Item\n7 of this Report and Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nIn addition to regulatory capital\nrequirements, we are subject to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital plan rule, capital stress\ntesting requirements and CCAR process, as well\nas the DFAST requirements of the Federal\nReserve and the OCC.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal\nReserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of\nthe capital planning process of BHCs,\nincluding PNC, that have $100 billion or more\nin total consolidated assets. For us, this\ncapital planning assessment is based on a\nreview of a comprehensive capital plan\nsubmitted to the Federal Reserve that\ndescribes the company\u2019s planned capital\nactions, such as plans to pay or increase\ncommon stock dividends, engage in common stock\nrepurchase programs, or issue or redeem\npreferred stock or other regulatory capital\ninstruments, during the nine quarter review\nperiod, as well as the results of stress tests\nconducted by both the company and the Federal\nReserve under different hypothetical macro-\neconomic scenarios, including a supervisory\nseverely adverse scenario provided by the\nFederal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s capital\nplan rule provides that a BHC must resubmit a\nnew capital plan prior to the next annual\nsubmission date if, among other things, there\nhas been or will be a material change in the\nBHC\u2019s risk profile, financial condition or\ncorporate structure since its last capital\nplan submission. In light of the economic\nuncertainty presented by the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve required large\nBHCs like PNC to resubmit their capital plans\nand additional stress test results in December\n2020. The Federal Reserve has indicated that\nit expects to complete the review of these\nresubmitted capital plans in early 2021.\n\nIn evaluating PNC\u2019s capital plan, the Federal\nReserve also considers a number of qualitative\nfactors. In assessing a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes, the Federal\nReserve considers whether the BHC has sound\nand effective governance to oversee these\nprocesses. The Federal Reserve\u2019s evaluation\nfocuses on whether a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes are supported by\na strong risk management framework to\nidentify, measure and assess material risks\nand that provides a strong foundation to\ncapital planning. The Federal Reserve also\nconsiders the comprehensiveness of a BHC\u2019s\ncontrol framework and evaluates a BHC\u2019s policy\nguidelines for capital planning and assessing\ncapital adequacy. A BHC\u2019s stress testing\nscenario design processes and approaches for\nestimating the impact of stress on its capital\nposition, including stress testing models and\nnon-model qualitative approaches, are\ncomprehensively reviewed to ensure that\nprojections reflect the impact of\nappropriately stressful conditions, as well as\nrisks idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital\nposition. Significant deficiencies in a BHC\u2019s\ncapital planning and stress testing processes\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                   Form 10-K 7\nmay result in supervisory directives that\nrequire the firm to address the identified\ndeficiencies and, potentially, a downgrade in\nthe BHC\u2019s supervisory capital positions and\nplanning rating.\n\nIn connection with the 2021 CCAR exercise, we\nmust file our capital plan and stress testing\nresults using financial data as of December\n31, 2020, with the Federal Reserve by April 6,\n2021. We expect to receive the Federal\nReserve\u2019s response to the capital plan\nsubmitted as part of the 2021 CCAR, as well as\nPNC\u2019s preliminary SCB for the period from the\nfourth quarter of 2021 through the third\nquarter of 2022, in June 2021. The Federal\nReserve must provide firms their final SCB for\nthis period by August 31, 2021, which would\nreflect any changes made to the firm\u2019s planned\ncommon stock dividends to remain in compliance\nwith the firm\u2019s SCB.\n\nAs part of the annual CCAR and DFAST\nprocesses, the Federal Reserve releases\ncertain revenue, loss and capital results for\neach participating firm from its supervisory\nstress testing exercises. As a Category III\ninstitution, PNC must conduct a company-run\nDFAST stress test biennially in even numbered\nyears and release PNC\u2019s projections of certain\nrevenue, loss and capital results from the\nexercise under the agencies\u2019 hypothetical\nsupervisory severely adverse macro-economic\nscenario and applying the agencies\u2019 DFAST\ncapital action assumptions.\n\nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity\nRisk Management Requirements . The Basel\nCommittee\u2019s Basel III framework also includes\nshort-term liquidity standards (LCR) and long-\nterm funding standards (NSFR).\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies\u2019 LCR rules are\ndesigned to ensure that covered banking\norganizations maintain an adequate level of\ncash and HQLA to meet estimated net liquidity\nneeds in a short-term stress scenario using\nliquidity inflow and outflow assumptions\nprescribed in the rules (net cash outflow). A\ncompany\u2019s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as\ncalculated in accordance with the haircuts and\nlimitations in the rule, divided by its net\ncash outflows, with the quotient expressed as\na percentage. The regulatory minimum LCR that\ncovered banking organizations are required to\nmaintain is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are\nrequired to calculate the LCR on a daily\nbasis. If either institution\u2019s LCR is below\nthe minimum requirement for three consecutive\nbusiness days, the institution must promptly\nprovide its regulator with a plan for\nachieving compliance with the minimum LCR\nrequirement. At December 31, 2020, the LCR for\nPNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required minimum\nlevels.\n\nThe NSFR is designed to promote a stable\nmaturity structure of assets and liabilities\nof banking organizations over a one-year time\nhorizon. In 2020, the federal banking agencies\nfinalized rules that would implement the NSFR\nin the U.S., which become effective July 1,\n2021. The rules require a covered BHC to\ncalculate its NSFR as the ratio of its ASF to\nits RSF amount over a one-year horizon. The\nregulatory minimum ratio for all covered\nbanking organizations (expressed as a\npercentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are\nrequired to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing\nbasis. If either institution\u2019s NSFR falls, or\nis likely to fall below, the minimum\nrequirement, the institution must provide its\nregulator with a plan for achieving compliance\nwith the minimum NSFR requirement. We expect\nPNC and PNC Bank to be in compliance with the\nNSFR when it becomes effective.\n\nAs Category III institutions with less than\n$75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale\nfunding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to\nreduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each\ncompany\u2019s LCR net outflows and RSF (as\ncalculated under the rules) reduced by 15%,\nthereby reducing the amount of HQLA or ASF\neach institution must hold to meet the LCR and\nNSFR minimum requirements, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, PNC had weighted short-term\nwholesale funding for these purposes of $31.4\nbillion.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs,\nincluding PNC, to publicly disclose certain\nquantitative and qualitative measures of their\nLCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These\ndisclosures include major components used to\ncalculate the LCR and NSFR ( e.g. , HQLA, cash\noutflows and inflows for the LCR, and ASF and\nRSF for the NSFR, at the consolidated parent\ncompany), and a qualitative discussion of the\nBHC\u2019s LCR and NSFR results, including, among\nother things, key drivers of the results,\ncomposition of HQLA and ASF, and concentration\nof funding sources.\n\nAs a Category III institution, PNC also is\nsubject to Federal Reserve rules that require\nPNC to, among other things, conduct internal\nliquidity stress tests over a range of time\nhorizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid\nassets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity\nstress test, and maintain a contingency\nfunding plan that meets certain requirements.\n\nFor additional discussion of regulatory\nliquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and\nDividends . The principal source of our\nliquidity at the parent company level is\ndividends from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject\nto various restrictions on its ability to pay\ndividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct\nparent, which is a wholly-owned direct\nsubsidiary of The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. PNC Bank is also subject to\nfederal laws limiting extensions of credit to\nits parent holding company and non-bank\naffiliates as discussed in Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters in the\n\n8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report. Further information on\nbank level liquidity and parent company\nliquidity is also available in the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is\nexpected to serve as a source of financial\nstrength to its subsidiary banks and to commit\nresources to support such banks if necessary.\nDodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve\njointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the\nFDIC to implement this source of strength\nrequirement. These joint rules have not yet\nbeen proposed. Consistent with this source of\nstrength policy for subsidiary banks, the\nFederal Reserve has stated that, as a matter\nof prudent banking, a BHC generally should not\nmaintain a rate of cash dividends unless its\nnet income available to common shareholders\nhas been sufficient to fully fund the\ndividends and the prospective rate of earnings\nretention appears to be consistent with the\ncorporation\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and\noverall financial condition. Further, in\nproviding guidance to the large BHCs\nparticipating in the CCAR exercise, discussed\nabove, the Federal Reserve has expected\ncapital plans to reflect conservative dividend\npayout ratios.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Requirements . Under\nFederal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with\ntotal consolidated assets of $100 billion or\nmore are subject to various enhanced\nprudential standards related to liquidity risk\nmanagement and overall risk management. For\nPNC, these rules, among other things,\nestablish liquidity stress testing\nrequirements (discussed above), limitations on\nPNC\u2019s aggregate net credit exposures to any\nsingle, unaffiliated company (referred to as\nthe SCCL), and certain oversight and\ngovernance responsibilities for PNC\u2019s Chief\nRisk Officer, the Board of Directors, and the\nRisk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s SCCL rules, PNC\u2019s\naggregate net credit exposure (including\nexposure resulting from, among other\ntransactions, extensions of credit, repurchase\nand reverse repurchase transactions,\ninvestments in securities and derivative\ntransactions) to any unaffiliated counterparty\nmay not exceed 25% of PNC\u2019s Tier 1 capital.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is required to impose a\nmaximum 15-to-1 debt to equity ratio on a BHC\nif the federal agencies that comprise the FSOC\ndetermine that the company poses a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\nand that the imposition of such a debt-to-\nequity requirement would mitigate such risk.\nThe Federal Reserve also is required to\nestablish early remediation requirements for\nBHCs with more than $250 billion in total\nassets and continues to work towards\nfinalizing these requirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop\nthe set of enhanced prudential standards that\napply to large BHCs in order to further\npromote the resiliency of such firms and the\nU.S. financial system. For additional\ninformation, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this\nReport.\n\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act . The GLB\nAct permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to\nbecome a \u201cfinancial holding company\u201d and\nthereby engage in, or affiliate with companies\nengaging in, a broader range of financial\nactivities than would otherwise be permitted\nfor a BHC. Permitted affiliates include\nsecurities underwriters and dealers, insurance\ncompanies, insurance agents and companies\nengaged in other activities that are\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of the\nTreasury, to be \u201cfinancial in nature or\nincidental thereto\u201d or are determined by the\nFederal Reserve unilaterally to be\n\u201ccomplementary\u201d to financial activities. We\nbecame a financial holding company in 2000. A\nBHC qualifies to become a financial holding\ncompany if the BHC and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions are \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nand \u201cwell managed\u201d and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions have a rating under\nthe CRA of Satisfactory or better. Among other\nactivities, we currently rely on our status as\na financial holding company to conduct\nmerchant banking activities and securities\nunderwriting and dealing activities. As\nsubsidiaries of a financial holding company\nunder the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries\nare generally allowed to conduct new financial\nactivities, and we generally are permitted to\nacquire non-bank financial companies that have\nless than $10 billion in assets, with after-\nthe-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying\nnational banks to engage in expanded\nactivities through a \u201cfinancial subsidiary.\u201d\nPNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary\ncertification with the OCC and currently\nengages in insurance agency activities through\nfinancial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also\ngenerally engage through a financial\nsubsidiary in any activity that is determined\nto be financial in nature or incidental to a\nfinancial activity by the Secretary of the\nTreasury, in consultation with the Federal\nReserve (other than insurance underwriting\nactivities, insurance company investment\nactivities and merchant banking). In order to\nestablish a financial subsidiary, a national\nbank and each of its depository institution\naffiliates must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cwell managed\u201d and the national bank and each\nof its depository institution affiliates must\nhave a CRA rating of Satisfactory or better.\n\nIf a financial holding company or a national\nbank with a financial subsidiary fails to\ncontinue to meet the applicable \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d or \u201cwell managed\u201d criteria, the\nfinancial holding company or national bank\nmust enter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among\nother things, identifies how the capital or\nmanagement deficiencies will be corrected.\nUntil such deficiencies are corrected, the\nrelevant agency may impose limits or\nconditions on the activities of the company or\nbank, and the company or bank may not engage\nin, or acquire a company engaged in, the types\nof expanded activities only permissible for a\nfinancial holding company or financial\nsubsidiary without prior approval of the\nrelevant agency.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                   Form 10-K 9\nIn addition, a financial holding company\ngenerally may not engage in a new financial\nactivity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire\na company engaged in such a new activity, if\nany of its insured depository institutions\nreceives a CRA rating of less than\nSatisfactory. A national bank\u2019s financial\nsubsidiary generally may not engage in a new\nfinancial activity authorized by the GLB Act,\nor acquire a company engaged in such a new\nfinancial activity, if the national bank or\nany of its insured depository institution\naffiliates received a CRA rating of less than\nSatisfactory. At December 31, 2020, PNC Bank\nhad an Outstanding rating with respect to CRA.\n\nIn 2020, the OCC finalized rules to modernize\nits regulations implementing the CRA. The\nrules significantly alter what activities by a\nbank qualify for CRA credit, where such\nactivities must be conducted to receive\ncredit, how the agencies measure a bank\u2019s CRA\nperformance, and how a bank must document and\nreport its CRA qualifying activities. The new\nrules would go into effect for PNC Bank on\nJanuary 1, 2023.\n\nVolcker Rule . The Volcker Rule and its\nimplementing regulations prohibit banking\nentities from engaging in short-term trading\nas principal and having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with hedge\nfunds, private equity funds, and certain other\nprivate funds (together, \u201ccovered funds\u201d),\nunless an exemption or exception applies. For\nexample, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule\nallow banking entities to trade as principal\nfor securities underwriting, market making and\nrisk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a\nvariety of conditions. As a result of rule\nchanges adopted in 2019, PNC and PNC Bank are\nsubject to simplified and tailored compliance\nprogram requirements because each entity has\ntrading assets and liabilities of less than\n$20 billion.\n\nTo date, the prohibitions under the final\nVolcker Rule regulations have not had a\nmaterial effect on our businesses or revenue;\nhowever it is possible that the regulations\nmay be modified in the future. Moreover, the\nconditions for engaging in exempted trading\nactivities and having permissible\nrelationships with a private fund under the\nregulations could, depending on the agencies\u2019\napproach to interpreting them, cause us to\nforego engaging in hedging or other\ntransactions that we would otherwise undertake\nin the ordinary course of business and, thus,\nto some extent, may limit our ability to most\neffectively hedge our risks, manage our\nbalance sheet or provide products or services\nto our customers. We also have divested\nprohibited investments in covered funds and\nreceived extensions allowing an extended\nconformance period for our remaining $0.1\nbillion interests in illiquid covered funds.\n\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and\nSupervision . The federal banking agencies\npossess broad powers to take corrective action\nas deemed appropriate based on the actions,\noperations or risk management programs of a\nBHC, an insured depository institution or\ntheir subsidiaries, and the Federal Reserve\nand the OCC have the ability to take\nenforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank,\nrespectively, to prevent and remedy acts and\npractices that the agencies determine to be\nunfair or deceptive. A finding that we have\nengaged in a deceptive act or practice may\nhave collateral consequences on our ability to\nrely on certain exemptions, or take advantage\nof certain provisions of, the securities laws\nabsent a government waiver of such\nrestrictions.\n\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination\nratings, lower capital ratios than peer group\ninstitutions, or regulatory concerns regarding\nmanagement, controls, assets, operations or\nother factors can all potentially result in\npractical limitations on the ability of a bank\nor BHC to engage in new activities, grow,\nacquire new businesses, repurchase its stock\nor pay dividends, or continue to conduct\nexisting activities. Furthermore, the OCC has\nestablished certain heightened risk management\nand governance standards for large banks,\nincluding PNC Bank. The guidelines, among\nother things, establish minimum standards for\nthe design and implementation of a risk\ngovernance framework, describe the appropriate\nrisk management roles and responsibilities of\nfront line units, independent risk management,\ninternal audit, and the board of directors,\nand provide that a covered bank should have a\ncomprehensive written statement that\narticulates its risk appetite and serves as a\nbasis for the framework. If the OCC determines\nthat a covered national bank is not in\ncompliance with these or other enforceable\nguidelines (including guidelines relating to\ninformation security standards), the OCC may\nrequire the bank to submit a corrective action\nplan and may initiate enforcement action\nagainst the bank if an acceptable plan is not\nsubmitted or the bank fails to comply with an\napproved plan.\n\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve\nAct and the Federal Reserve\u2019s implementing\nregulation, Regulation W, place quantitative\nand qualitative restrictions on covered\ntransactions between a bank and its affiliates\n(for example between PNC Bank, on the one\nhand, and The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the\nother hand). In general, Section 23A and\nRegulation W limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and any single\naffiliate to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and all its\naffiliates to 20% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing\nlow-quality assets from an affiliate, and\nrequire certain covered transactions to be\nsecured with prescribed amounts of collateral.\nSection 23B generally requires that\ntransactions between a bank and its affiliates\nbe on terms that are at least as favorable to\nthe bank as the terms that would apply in\ncomparable transactions between the bank and a\nthird party. Dodd-Frank amended Section 23A of\nthe Federal Reserve Act to include as a\ncovered transaction the credit exposure of a\nbank to an affiliate arising from a derivative\ntransaction with the affiliate. The Federal\nReserve has yet to propose rules to implement\nthese revisions.\n\n10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve\nregulations also place quantitative\nlimitations and conditions on extensions of\ncredit by a bank to its executive officers,\ndirectors, or principal shareholders and their\nrelated interests (including any company\ncontrolled by such persons). Generally,\nextensions of credit by a bank to such\nindividuals, companies, and related interests\nmust comply with certain individual and\naggregate lending limits, as well as\nprocedural and qualitative requirements. As a\nresult of the amount of PNC common stock held\nby its advised mutual funds and other\naccounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a\nprincipal shareholder of PNC Bank for purposes\nof these regulations. The federal banking\nagencies have issued an interagency statement\naddressing the application of these insider\nlending restrictions to the other portfolio\ncompanies owned or controlled by the advised\nfunds and accounts of a fund complex that\ncould be considered a principal shareholder of\na bank, which is effective through January 1,\n2022.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided\nguidance regarding incentive and other\nelements of compensation provided to\nexecutives and other employees at banking\norganizations they regulate, both as general\nindustry-wide guidance and guidance specific\nto select larger companies, including PNC.\nThese guidelines are intended to ensure that\nthe incentive compensation practices of\ncovered banking organizations do not encourage\nexcessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC\nand two other regulatory agencies to adopt\nregulations governing incentive compensation\nprovided by regulated financial services\ncompanies to their executives and other\nemployees. These agencies jointly proposed\nregulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to\nimplement these requirements. Final\nregulations have not been adopted.\n\nThe trust, investment advisory and other\nfiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank\nalso are subject to the OCC\u2019s regulations\ngoverning the fiduciary activities of national\nbanks, as well as applicable state fiduciary\nlaws. The OCC\u2019s regulations, among other\nthings, set standards for the administration\nof fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern\npotential conflicts of interests, and\nestablish recordkeeping requirements for\nfiduciary accounts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval is\nrequired whenever we propose to acquire all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of any bank,\nto acquire direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of any class of voting\nsecurities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or\nconsolidate with any other BHC. The BHC Act\nand other federal law enumerates the factors\nthe Federal Reserve must consider when\nreviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition\nof banks or the acquisition of voting\nsecurities of a bank or BHC. These factors\ninclude the competitive effects of the\nproposal in the relevant geographic markets;\nthe financial and managerial resources and\nfuture prospects of the companies and banks\ninvolved in the transaction; the effect of the\ntransaction on the financial stability of the\nU.S.; the organizations\u2019 compliance with anti-\nmoney laundering laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved; and the records of performance under\nthe CRA of the insured depository institutions\ninvolved in the transaction.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval also is\nrequired, and similar factors are considered,\nfor a BHC to acquire direct or indirect\nownership or control of more than 5% of any\nclass of voting securities of a savings\nassociation or savings and loan holding\ncompany, or to merge or consolidate with a\nsavings and loan holding company. In cases\ninvolving interstate bank acquisitions, the\nFederal Reserve also must consider the\nconcentration of deposits nationwide and in\ncertain individual states. A BHC is generally\nprohibited from merging or consolidating with,\nor acquiring, another company or bank if upon\nconsummation the resulting company would\ncontrol 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or\na state, or if the resulting company\u2019s\nliabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate\nliabilities of the U.S. financial sector\n(including the U.S. liabilities of foreign\nfinancial companies). In extraordinary cases,\nthe FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve, could order the break-up of financial\nfirms that are deemed to present a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\n\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to\nacquire another insured bank or savings\nassociation by merger or to acquire deposits\nor substantially all of the assets of such\ninstitutions. In deciding whether to approve\nsuch a transaction, the OCC is required to\nconsider factors similar to those that must be\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve in\nconnection with the acquisition of a bank or\nBHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is\nrequired to merge a nonbank entity into PNC\nBank. PNC and PNC Bank have requested the\nprior approval of the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC, respectively, to acquire BBVA and BBVA\nUSA, and to merge BBVA with and into PNC and\nBBVA USA with and into PNC Bank.\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized rules\ngoverning when a BHC is presumed to \u201ccontrol\u201d\nanother company for purposes of the BHC Act,\nthereby causing the company to be considered a\nsubsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The\nrules establish a set of presumptions\nidentifying when a BHC would be deemed to\ncontrol another company, with the nature and\nscope of relationships a BHC may have with a\nnon-controlled company (e.g., director or\nofficer representatives, scope of business\nrelationships, etc.) declining as the BHC\u2019s\nvoting ownership percentage in the company\nincreases.\n\nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters . PNC Bank\nis insured by the FDIC and subject to deposit\npremium assessments. Regulatory matters could\nincrease the cost of FDIC deposit insurance\npremiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit\ninsurance premiums are \u201crisk based.\u201d\nTherefore, higher fee percentages would be\ncharged to banks that have lower capital\nratios or higher risk profiles. These risk\nprofiles take into account, among other\nthings, weaknesses that are found by the\nprimary federal banking regulator through its\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 11\nexamination and supervision of the bank and\nthe bank\u2019s holdings of assets or liabilities\nclassified as higher risk by the FDIC,\nincluding brokered deposits. A negative\nevaluation by the FDIC or a bank\u2019s primary\nfederal banking regulator could increase the\ncosts to a bank and result in an aggregate\ncost of deposit funds higher than that of\ncompeting banks in a lower risk category.\n\nPNC Bank is subject to certain enhanced\ndeposit insurance recordkeeping requirements\nadopted by the FDIC, which are designed to\nassist the FDIC to promptly determine whether,\nor to what extent, a large bank\u2019s deposits are\ncovered by deposit insurance if the bank were\nto fail. These requirements became effective\non April 1, 2020. Banks may request an\nextension of this compliance date in certain\ncircumstances for up to one year.\n\nFederal banking laws and regulations also\napply a variety of requirements or\nrestrictions on insured depository\ninstitutions with respect to brokered\ndeposits. For instance, only a \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d insured depository institution\nmay accept brokered deposits without prior\nregulatory approval. In addition, brokered\ndeposits are generally subject to higher\noutflow assumptions than other types of\ndeposits for purposes of the LCR. In December\n2020, the FDIC finalized rules that establish\na new framework for determining whether\ndeposits are considered \u201cbrokered.\u201d\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning. BHCs that\nhave $100 billion or more in assets, such as\nPNC, are required to periodically submit to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution\nplan (including a public summary) that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the company could be resolved in a rapid\nand orderly fashion if the company were to\nfail or experience material financial\ndistress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may\njointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC,\nincluding additional capital requirements or\nlimitations on growth, if the agencies jointly\ndetermine that the company\u2019s plan is not\ncredible or would not facilitate a rapid and\norderly resolution of the company under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable\nresolution framework), and additionally could\nrequire the company to divest assets or take\nother actions if the company did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed. PNC\ngenerally must file a resolution plan with the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC at least once each\nthree-year period, with submissions\nalternating between a full plan and a plan\ntargeted on certain areas or subjects\nidentified by the agencies.\n\nPNC\u2019s next resolution plan is scheduled to be\na targeted plan and is due to be filed by\nDecember 17, 2021. The agencies, however, have\nreserved the ability to alter the scheduled\nfiling date for a covered company, request an\ninterim update before a covered company\u2019s next\nscheduled filing date and require a covered\ncompany to submit a full resolution plan in\nlieu of a scheduled targeted plan.\n\nThe FDIC also requires large insured\ndepository institutions, including PNC Bank,\nto periodically submit a resolution plan\n(including a public summary) to the FDIC that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the institution could be resolved under\nthe FDI Act in a manner that protects\ndepositors and limits losses or costs to\ncreditors of the bank in accordance with the\nFDI Act. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the\nmoratorium that it had instituted on\nresolution plan filings by insured depository\ninstitutions, but it is unclear at this time\nwhen PNC Bank\u2019s next resolution plan will be\ndue. Depending on how the agencies conduct\ntheir review of the resolution plans submitted\nby PNC and PNC Bank, these requirements could\naffect the ways in which PNC structures and\nconducts its business and result in higher\ncompliance and operating costs.\n\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines\nthat establish standards for recovery\nplanning. These guidelines require a covered\nbank to develop and maintain a recovery plan\nthat is evaluated and updated annually that,\namong other things, identifies a range of\noptions that could be undertaken by the\ncovered bank to restore its financial strength\nand viability should identified triggering\nevents occur. The recovery plan guidelines are\nenforceable in the same manner as the other\nguidelines the OCC has established.\n\nCFPB Regulation and Supervision . The CFPB\nexamines PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with\na broad range of federal consumer financial\nlaws and regulations, including the laws and\nregulations that relate to deposit products,\ncredit card, mortgage, automobile, student and\nother consumer loans, and other consumer\nfinancial products and services that we offer.\nThe consumer financial protection laws that\nare subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervision and\nenforcement powers include, among others, the\nTruth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act,\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. The CFPB\nalso has authority to take enforcement actions\nto prevent and remedy acts and practices\nrelating to consumer financial products and\nservices that it deems to be unfair, deceptive\nor abusive, and to impose new disclosure\nrequirements for any consumer financial\nproduct or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by PNC or PNC\nBank. The regulations could reduce the fees\nthat we receive, require that we provide\nadditional consumer disclosures, alter the way\nwe provide our products and services, impair\nour ability to compete with other providers of\nfinancial products or services, or expose us\nto greater risk of private litigation or\nregulatory enforcement action. The CFPB has\nengaged in rulemakings that affect, among\nother things, consumer remittance transfers,\nthe qualified mortgage definition under the\nTruth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection\n\n12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nPractices Act, and payday, vehicle title, and\ncertain high-cost installment loans and may\nestablish, or modify, rules governing other\naspects of consumer financial products or\nservices in the future.\n                                              \n  Securities and Derivatives Regulation       \n                                              \nOur registered broker-dealer and investment\nadviser subsidiaries are subject to the\nExchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act\nof 1940, respectively, and related rules and\nregulations promulgated by the SEC. These\nrules, for example, require that broker-\ndealers and investment advisers act in a\ncustomer\u2019s best interest when making\ninvestment recommendations to retail\ncustomers, which includes managing conflicts\nof interest, providing required disclosures\nand exercising a duty of care in making\ninvestment recommendations. FINRA is the\nprimary self-regulatory organization for our\nregistered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our\nbroker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries also are subject to additional\nregulation by states or local jurisdictions.\n\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement\nfunctions that oversee broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers and can bring actions that\nresult in fines, restitution, a limitation on\npermitted activities, disqualification to\ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an\ninability to rely on certain favorable\nexemptions. Certain types of infractions and\nviolations also can affect our ability to\nexpeditiously issue new securities into the\ncapital markets. In addition, certain changes\nin the activities of a broker-dealer require\napproval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into\naccount a variety of considerations in acting\nupon applications for such approval, including\ninternal controls, capital levels, management\nexperience and quality, prior enforcement and\ndisciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\n\nPNC Bank is provisionally registered as swap\ndealer with the CFTC. Because of the limited\nvolume of our security-based swap dealing\nactivities, PNC Bank has not registered (and\ncurrently does not intend to register) with\nthe SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\n\nPNC Bank\u2019s derivatives and foreign exchange\nbusinesses are subject to the regulations and\nrequirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap\ndealers, and the CFTC (and for certain\ndelegated responsibilities, the National\nFutures Association) has a meaningful\nsupervisory role with respect to PNC Bank\u2019s\nderivatives and foreign exchange businesses.\nThe CFTC\u2019s comprehensive and significant\nregulations are intended to (i) address\nsystemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater\ntransparency to the derivatives and foreign\nexchange markets, (iii) provide enhanced\ndisclosures and protections to customers and\n(iv) promote market integrity. Among other\nthings, these regulations (i) require that,\nabsent certain specified exemptions, most\nstandardized swaps be centrally cleared\nthrough a regulated clearing house and be\ntraded on a centralized exchange or swap\nexecution facility; (ii) subject PNC Bank to\ncapital requirements in excess of historical\npractice; (iii) subject PNC Bank to\ncomprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory\nreporting and real-time public reporting\nrequirements; (iv) subject PNC Bank to various\nbusiness conduct requirements, including the\nprovision of daily marks to counterparties and\ndisclosing to counterparties (pre-execution)\nthe material risks, material incentives, and\nany conflicts of interest associated with\ntheir swap; (v) impose special duties on PNC\nBank when transacting a swap with a \u201cspecial\nentity\u201d (e.g., governmental agency (federal,\nstate or local) or political subdivision\nthereof, pension plan or endowment); and (vi)\nimpose margin requirements on certain swaps\nthat are not centrally cleared through a\nregulated clearing house.\n\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to\nPNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC\nswap dealer, have and will continue to impose\ncompliance burdens on PNC Bank and introduce\nadditional legal risks (including as a result\nof applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation\nprovisions and private rights of action). In\naddition, failure to comply with the \u201cpay-to-\nplay\u201d regulations that govern our swap and\nmunicipal securities businesses could result\nin limitations on PNC Bank\u2019s ability to\nconduct swap and municipal securities business\nwith state or local governments and their\nauthorities.\n                                              \n  Regulations of Other Agencies               \n                                              \nIn addition to regulations issued by the\nfederal banking, securities and derivatives\nregulators, we also are subject to regulations\nissued by other federal agencies with respect\nto certain financial products and services we\noffer. For example, certain of our fiduciary,\nbrokerage and investment management activities\nare subject to regulations issued by the\nDepartment of Labor under ERISA and related\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code and\ncertain of our student lending and servicing\nactivities are subject to regulation by the\nDepartment of Education.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nWe are subject to intense competition from\nother regulated banking organizations, as well\nas various other types of financial\ninstitutions and non-bank entities that can\noffer a number of similar products and\nservices without being subject to bank\nregulatory supervision and restrictions.\n\nPNC Bank competes for deposits and/or loans\nwith:\n\n\u2022 Other commercial banks,\n\n\u2022 Savings banks,\n\n\u2022 Credit unions,\n\n\u2022 Consumer finance companies,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 13\n\u2022 Leasing companies,\n\n\u2022 Other non-bank lenders,\n\n\u2022 Financial technology companies,\n\n\u2022 Treasury management service companies,\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies, and\n\n\u2022 Issuers of commercial paper and other\nsecurities, including mutual funds.\n\nIn providing asset management services, our\nbusinesses compete with:\n\n\u2022 Investment management firms,\n\n\u2022 Large banks and other financial\ninstitutions,\n\n\u2022 Brokerage firms,\n\n\u2022 Financial technology companies,\n\n\u2022 Mutual fund complexes, and\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies.\n\nOur various non-bank businesses engaged in\ninvestment banking and alternative investment\nactivities compete with:\n\n\u2022 Commercial banks,\n\n\u2022 Investment banking firms,\n\n\u2022 Collateralized loan obligation managers,\n\n\u2022 Hedge funds,\n\n\u2022 Mutual fund complexes,\n\n\u2022 Merchant banks,\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies,\n\n\u2022 Private equity firms, and\n\n\u2022 Other investment vehicles.\n\nCompetition is based on a number of factors\nincluding pricing, product structure, the\nrange of products and services offered and the\nquality of customer service. Loan pricing,\nstructure and credit standards are extremely\nimportant as we seek to achieve appropriate\nrisk-adjusted returns. Deposit-taking\nactivities are also subject to pricing\npressures and to customer migration as a\nresult of intense competition for deposits and\ninvestments. Competitors may seek to compete\nwith us through traditional channels such as\nphysical locations or through digital channels\nsuch as the internet or mobile applications.\nWe include here by reference the additional\ninformation regarding competition and factors\naffecting our competitive position included in\nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\n                                              \n  Human Capital                               \n                                              \nEmployees totaled 51,257 at December 31, 2020.\nThis total included 49,549 full-time and 1,708\npart-time employees, of which 27,621 full-time\nand 1,611 part-time employees were employed in\nour Retail Banking business.\n\nPart of PNC\u2019s ability to compete effectively\ndepends on our ability to attract new\nemployees and retain and develop our existing\nemployees. In support of our employees, our\nstrategic human capital goals include:\n\n\u2022 Advancing PNC\u2019s talent-focused culture by\ndeveloping strong leaders who exemplify our\nLeadership Standards, a set of standards\ndesigned to hold managers accountable for\nintentional inclusion, living our Corporate\nValues, enabling change, achieving results and\ndeveloping the best talent and providing them\nwith the tools and insights to effectively\nmanage our people.\n\n\u2022 Focusing on the development and retention of\ndiverse, high performing talent and providing\nemployees with opportunities for professional\ngrowth, career mobility and health and\nfinancial wellness.\n\n\u2022 Supporting a strong, ethical culture\nanchored in our Corporate Values and doing the\nright thing for our employees, customers and\nshareholders.\n\n\u2022 Continuing to focus on improving workforce\ndiversity and creating an equitable and\ninclusive work place.\n\nIn managing our employees, we focus on these\nkey factors:\n\n\u2022 Recruiting, developing and retaining talent\n. We believe recruiting, developing and\nretaining talent starts with our leaders and\nwe measure our managers against our Leadership\nStandards. Our talent acquisition priority is\nto invest in the development of our internal\ntalent and to provide career advancement\nopportunities to our employees. We measure how\nmany open requisitions we fill with internal\ncandidates, participation in early career\ndevelopment programs and turnover. At our\nfirst-level and above career bands we fill\napproximately 62% of our open requisitions\nwith internal candidates, which has a direct\nimpact on our ability to retain and develop\nour people. In addition, we hire approximately\n500 interns and 500 full-time development\nprogram associates each year from our 11 early\ncareer development programs that support each\nof our lines of business and support areas.\n\n14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\n\u2022 Diversity, equity and inclusion . We focus\non attracting, developing and retaining a\ndiverse workforce that reflects and is\nequipped to meet the needs of our diverse\ncustomer base. We measure representation of\nLGBTQ+, people with disabilities, veterans,\nwomen and across all races and certain\nethnicities as self-disclosed by our\nemployees. As of December 31, 2020,\napproximately 59% of PNC\u2019s workforce and 50%\nof PNC\u2019s employees in managerial roles were\nwomen. People of color represented\napproximately 29% of PNC\u2019s workforce,\nincluding 22% of our employees in managerial\nroles, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\u2022 Total rewards . We design our compensation\nand benefits programs to focus on three key\naspects of employee well-being: health, money\nand quality of life. These programs include\ncompetitive base salaries and, depending on\neligibility, cash incentive or stock-based\naward opportunities, an Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan with employer\nmatch, a pension plan, healthcare, life\ninsurance and disability benefits, health\nsavings and dependent care flexible spending\naccounts, paid time off, paid maternity and\nparental leave, family care resources,\nflexible work schedules, a robust wellness\nprogram with incentives, adoption assistance,\nemployee assistance programs, educational\nassistance and on-site health care and child\ncare services, among others. Additionally, we\nconduct pay equity analyses to determine if\nemployees are being compensated fairly and\nconsistently across roles.\n\n\u2022 Employee engagement . Twice a year, PNC\nconducts employee surveys to measure employee\nengagement because we believe that engaged\nemployees have lower attrition rates and\nimproved customer outcomes.\n\nPNC continues to recognize the impacts that\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has had and will likely\ncontinue to have on our Human Capital.

Collectively, these\nmeasures, together with voluntary changes in\nbehavior, led to a substantial decrease in\neconomic activity and a dramatic increase in\nunemployment in the second quarter of 2020.\nGovernmental bodies also enacted laws designed\nto stabilize the economy and provide relief to\nbusinesses and individuals to mitigate the\nconsequences of COVID-19 and the policies\nrestricting the operation of businesses and\nthe movement of individuals.\n\nWhile economic conditions have improved,\neconomic activity remains below its pre-\npandemic level, with the partial recovery\ninconsistent across different geographic\nregions, sectors, companies and individuals\nand subject to setbacks as conditions related\nto the pandemic fluctuate. If efforts to\ncontain COVID-19 are unsuccessful and\nrestrictions on businesses and activities\ncontinue in place for extended periods or are\nincreased, the recovery would likely be much\nweaker and the economy could fall back into\nrecession. While several vaccines have been\napproved for use and others remain in\ndevelopment or clinical trials, significant\nuncertainty remains regarding the speed with\nwhich effective vaccines can be manufactured\nand widely distributed and the willingness of\nindividuals to get vaccinated. As a result,\nthere is still a great deal of uncertainty\nabout the length and severity of the pandemic\nand the strength or reversal of the economic\nrebound, including whether there will be\nadditional fiscal stimulus from the federal\ngovernment and, if so, its size, scope and\neffectiveness. Accordingly, the outbreak and\nits consequences, including responsive\nmeasures to manage it, had and are likely to\ncontinue to have an adverse effect, possibly\nmaterially, on our overall business and\nfinancial performance. The longer the public\nhealth crisis lasts and the greater its\nseverity, the greater the likely adverse\nimpact on the economy, our customers and our\nbusiness and financial performance. The\nfollowing are examples of the most likely\nimpacts on PNC:\n\n\u2022 The deterioration of national and global\neconomic conditions and elevated levels of\nunemployment have negatively affected and are\nlikely to continue to negatively affect,\npossibly materially, our financial performance\nand operations. The following are the key\nfactors contributing to this risk:\n\n\u25e6 There is a greater likelihood that more of\nour commercial and consumer customers or\ncounterparties will become delinquent on their\nloans or other obligations to us, which, in\nturn, will result in a higher level of non-\nperforming loans and net charge-offs,\nparticularly in the sectors most adversely\nimpacted by the pandemic. Even if a loan\nreturns to full performing status, it may be\non modified terms that result in, for example,\na term extension, interest rate reduction or\nprincipal deferral or forgiveness. Increases\nin loan delinquencies or modifications will\nalso result in increased administrative costs.\nIn addition, given the uncertainty about the\nlength and severity of the pandemic and the\nstrength or reversal of the economic rebound,\nour provision for credit losses may be more\nvolatile period-to-period with a corresponding\nincrease in period-to-period volatility in our\nnet income.\n\n\u25e6 There has been and there is likely to\ncontinue to be a decrease in the demand for\ncertain of our products and services which\ncould be further exacerbated if customers lose\nconfidence due to concerns regarding the\neconomy. We have also waived certain fees\nassociated with our products and services for\ncustomers affected by the pandemic and may\ncontinue to do so. In addition, while customer\ndeposits have grown aiding our liquidity,\nfuture changes in behavior resulting in\ndeclining deposit balances would likely\nincrease our funding costs and reduce our net\ninterest income and liquidity resources.\n\n\u25e6 These rapidly changing and unprecedented\nmarket conditions have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact the valuation of assets as\nreported within our consolidated financial\nstatements, as well as causing substantial\nreductions\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 17\nin the value of our assets under management,\nall with the possible effects described in the\nRisk Factor headed \u201cOur business and financial\nperformance are vulnerable to the impact of\nchanges in the values of financial assets.\u201d\n\n\u25e6 Although PNC\u2019s capital levels continue to be\nstrong, the degradation in economic conditions\nalso has and is likely to continue to\nnegatively affect our capital position,\npossibly materially, which is critical to our\nability to operate and grow our business. In\naddition, continued or accelerated disruption\nand volatility in the financial markets or\nlong-lasting or deeper recessionary conditions\nmay diminish our access to the capital markets\nor result in or contribute to downgrades of\nour credit ratings. We have suspended our\ndiscretionary common share repurchase program\nand may take further actions that would limit\na return of capital to shareholders, including\npotentially a reduction or suspension of the\ndividend payable to common shareholders, as a\nresult of these conditions and their effect on\nour financial performance and position or as a\nresult of regulatory guidance.\n\n\u2022 Some of the legislation responsive to the\noutbreak, including the CARES Act and the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, provides for\ncertain commercial and consumer protections\nwhich have altered and may continue to alter\nthe profitability of the transactions in which\nwe engage, such as by allowing borrowers to\ndelay payments on loans or other obligations\nand imposing other costs on us. These laws\nhave also delayed and restricted and may\ncontinue to delay or restrict our ability to\nrealize the value of collateral by, for\nexample, providing temporary foreclosure\nprotection and eviction protection even when\ncustomers are in breach of their obligations\nto us. These laws may be extended or increased\nin scope, and other laws may be enacted in\nresponse to the pandemic that have similar or\nbroader effects on us. We may also be limited\nin our ability to realize the value of\ncollateral as a result of court closures and\nrelated delays. Moreover, collateral may be\nliquidated at prices insufficient to recover\nthe full amount of exposure to us as a result\nof deteriorating economic conditions and\nvolatile markets. See Supervision and\nRegulation in Item 1 of this Report for more\ninformation on PNC\u2019s implementation of these\nprograms.\n\n\u2022 Other laws related to employee benefits and\nthe treatment of employees have negatively\nimpacted and may continue to negatively impact\nus by increasing administrative, compensation\nand benefits costs by, for example, mandating\ncoverage of certain COVID-19 related testing\nand treatment or mandating additional paid or\nunpaid leave. Further governmental action that\nis taken to mitigate the economic effects of\nthe pandemic, as well as additional\ncompensation or benefit actions taken by PNC,\ncould adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations, possibly\nmaterially, in other ways that are not known\nnow.\n\n\u2022 In response to the outbreak and its economic\nconsequences, the Federal Reserve lowered its\ntarget for the federal funds rate to a range\nof 0% to 0.25% and has signaled that it\nexpects to keep interest rates at a low level\nfor through at least 2023. As a result of the\nhigh percentage of our assets and liabilities\nthat are in the form of interest-bearing or\ninterest-related instruments, this change in\ninterest rates has had and likely will\ncontinue to have a negative impact on our net\ninterest income and net interest margin, which\ncould be material and which could materially\nadversely affect our profitability. The\neffects of a low interest rate environment are\nfurther described in the Risk Factor headed\n\u201cOur business and financial performance are\nimpacted significantly by market interest\nrates and movements in those rates.\u201d\n\n\u2022 To protect our employees, customers and the\ncommunities in which we operate, we modified\nthe operations of many of our retail branches,\nincluding temporarily closing some branches,\nlimiting operations to drive-through only in\nother locations, and otherwise implemented\nwork-from-home policies for a significant\nportion of our workforce. While our retail\noperations have largely re-opened, we cannot\nguarantee that our branches will continue to\nremain open if the outbreak worsens or there\nis an increase in governmental restrictions.\nOur non-branch based workforce continues to\nwork primarily remotely. We believe we are\ncapable of substantially meeting the needs of\nour customers despite these modifications.\nHowever, these efforts may result in the loss\nof customers, impede our ability to perform\ncertain transactions, and impair our ability\nto effectively identify, manage and control\nrisk. For example, customers may be unwilling\nor unable to conduct transactions with us via\nonline channels or through a local branch that\nis operating only in a drive-through mode.\nAnother example is the infrastructure needed\nto provide products and services via online\nchannels or to work effectively in a work-\nfrom-home environment, such as internet,\ntelecommunications and internal information\ntechnology systems, may fail to perform as\nanticipated, resulting in our inability to\ndeliver products or services or effectively\nmanage the risks arising from our businesses.\nIn addition, we rely on our employees, third\nparty vendors and service providers and other\ncounterparties, both domestically and abroad,\nto support many aspects of our business.\nReduced workforces which may be caused by, but\nnot limited to, illness, quarantine, stay at\nhome or other government mandates, or\ndifficulties transitioning back to an in\noffice environment, could result in an adverse\nimpact to our operations and financial\nperformance. Redeployment of employees from\ncurrent positions and of technology from\ncurrent uses to support products and services\nresponsive to the outbreak may further\nadversely impact our operations. Further,\nthird party vendors, service providers and\nother counterparties, both domestically and\nabroad, face access, connectivity or other\nchallenges operating within a work-from-home\nvirtual environment.\n\n\u2022 In support of our employees, customers and\ncommunities, we may take steps beyond or in\naddition to those required by governmental or\nregulatory minimums which may further\nadversely impact our profitability. For\nexample, we have provided and may continue to\nprovide additional relief or forbearance to\ncustomers, health and wellness benefits to\nemployees (including significant company\napproved leave) or financial support for\ncommunity initiatives to assist those in need\nas a result of the outbreak. The actual or\nperceived failure to provide sufficient\nservices, support or relief to those\nbusinesses or individuals in need or properly\nimplement legislation responsive to the\noutbreak or our voluntary commitments could\nnegatively impact our reputation with adverse\nconsequences to our business. In addition,\nsuch actual or perceived failure, or\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\noperational and other issues that arise in\nconnection with the implementation of\ngovernment-mandated or other financial\nassistance or relief programs present elevated\nlevels of legal and reputational risk,\nincluding governmental and regulatory\ninquiries, investigations and enforcement\nactions, as well as private lawsuits.\nParticipation by PNC in governmental programs\ndesigned to provide liquidity to the financial\nsystem or impacted businesses, such as\nborrowing through the Federal Reserve discount\nwindow or borrowing from, or selling financial\nassets to, facilities established by the\nFederal Reserve or participation in programs\nunder the CARES Act and the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, such as the PPP, also have\nexposed and may continue to expose us to\ngovernmental investigation and action or\npublic scrutiny and criticism, either at the\ntime we participate in the program or\nsubsequently.\n\nRefer to our other Risk Factors in this Item\n1A for information regarding other factors\nthat have and are likely to continue to affect\nour business and financial performance as a\nresult of the pandemic.\n\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other\nExternal Factors, Including Regulation\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of adverse economic\nconditions.\n\nAs a financial services company, our business\nand overall financial performance are affected\nto a significant extent by economic\nconditions, primarily in the U.S.\n\nDeclining or adverse economic conditions and\nadverse changes in investor, consumer, and\nbusiness sentiment generally result in reduced\nbusiness activity, which may decrease the\ndemand for our products and services or reduce\nthe number of creditworthy borrowers. The\nability of borrowers to repay loans is often\nweakened as a result of economic downturns and\nhigher unemployment. Such economic conditions\nalso may lead to turmoil and volatility in\nfinancial markets, often with at least some\nfinancial asset categories losing value. Any\nof these effects would likely have an adverse\nimpact on financial institutions such as PNC,\nwith the significance of the impact generally\ndepending on the nature and severity of the\nadverse economic conditions.\n\nEven when economic conditions are relatively\ngood or stable, specific economic factors can\nnegatively affect our business and\nperformance. This can be especially true when\nthe factors relate to particular segments of\nthe economy. For example, shifting consumer\nbehavior with respect to retail purchases\nbeing made over the internet rather than in\nphysical stores has negatively impacted\nperformance by some retailers. This likely\ndecreases demand for financial services in\nthat sector, possibly harming the\ncreditworthiness of some shopping mall\noperators, retail companies and others with\nwhom we do business. As another example,\ndislocations in international trade, such as\nincreased tariffs and interruptions in\ninternational supply chains likely adversely\naffect companies that are relatively dependent\non imports or exports, impacting prices and\ndemand for goods or services. Affected\ncompanies may experience lower levels of\nbusiness and possible declining\ncreditworthiness as compared to companies less\ndependent on international trade.\n\nGiven the geographic scope of our business and\noperations, we are most exposed to issues\nwithin the U.S. economy and financial markets.\nWithin the U.S., we are currently most exposed\nto issues primarily within markets located in\nthe Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast.\nFollowing the proposed acquisition of BBVA,\nincluding its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA\nUSA, this footprint will expand particularly\nto include a larger presence in the Southwest\nand West Coast, thereby increasing our\nexposure to regional economic issues in those\nareas.\n\nOur foreign business activities continue to be\na relatively small part of our overall\nbusiness. As a result, the direct impact on\nour business and performance from economic\nconditions outside the U.S. is not likely to\nbe significant, although the impact would\nincrease if we expand our foreign business\nmore than nominally. We are, however,\nsusceptible to the risk that such economic\nconditions could negatively affect our\nbusiness and financial performance. Primarily,\nthis risk results from the possibility that\npoor economic conditions or financial market\ndisruptions affecting other major economies\nwould also affect the U.S.\n\nThroughout the remainder of this Risk Factors\nsection, we address specific ways in which\neconomic issues could create risk for us and\nresult in adverse impacts on our business and\nfinancial performance. In particular, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has led to economic issues\nof the types described here and presents the\nrisk of further such impacts. See the\nimmediately preceding Risk Factor for a\ndiscussion of risks associated with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe impact of government legislation,\nregulation and policy and other political\nfactors on the economy could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial\nperformance.\n\nChanges in law or governmental policy\naffecting the economy, business activity, or\npersonal spending, investing or saving\nactivities may cause consumers and businesses\nto alter behavior in ways that impact demand\nfor our products and services. Such changes\nmay also alter the profitability of the\ntransactions in which we engage or result in\nincreased regulatory burden and associated\ncosts. PNC may alter the types or terms of the\nproducts and services we offer to reflect such\nchanges. Uncertainty regarding future law or\npolicy may have similar impacts. The recent\nelection of a new U.S. President, together\nwith some changes in the membership of\nCongress,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 19\nincluding change in control of the Senate,\nwill likely lead to changes in law or policy,\nincluding the level of regulation of financial\ninstitutions and the enforcement environment.\nMoreover, a change in regulatory practices\nthat increases the time frames to obtain\nregulatory approvals for acquisitions and\nother activities or makes them more difficult\nto obtain could affect our ability to make\nacquisitions or introduce new products and\nservices.\n\nConcern regarding the ability of Congress and\nthe President, which increases to the extent\ngovernment is divided, collectively to reach\nagreement on federal budgetary matters\n(including the debt ceiling), or prolonged\nstalemates leading to total or partial\ngovernmental shutdowns, also can have adverse\neconomic consequences and create the risk of\neconomic instability or market volatility,\nwith potential adverse consequences to our\nbusiness and financial performance.\n\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other\ngovernmental agencies have a significant\nimpact on interest rates and overall financial\nmarket performance, which are important to our\nbusiness and financial performance.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve\nhave a significant impact on interest rates\nand overall financial market performance.\nThese policies can thus affect the activities\nand results of operations of financial\ncompanies such as PNC. An important function\nof the Federal Reserve is to monitor the\nnational supply of bank credit and set certain\ninterest rates. The actions of the Federal\nReserve influence the rates of interest that\nwe charge on loans and that we pay on\nborrowings and interest-bearing deposits.\nRates of interest can also affect the value of\nour on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet\nfinancial instruments. We cannot predict the\nnature or timing of future changes in monetary\npolicies or the precise effects that they may\nhave on our activities and financial results.\n\nIn addition, monetary policy actions by\ngovernmental authorities in the European Union\nor other countries could have an impact on\nglobal interest rates, which could affect\nrates in the U.S. as well as rates on\ninstruments denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar, any of which could have\none or more of the potential effects on us\ndescribed above.\n\nSome of the potential impacts on our business\nand results of governmental monetary policy\nare described in Risk Factors under the\nheading \u201cRisks Related to the Business of\nBanking.\u201d The Federal Reserve has lowered its\nbenchmark rates to historically low levels as\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the\nRisk Factor headed \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has\nhad and is likely to continue to have an\nadverse effect, possibly materially, on our\noverall business and financial performance.\u201d\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are\nsubject to numerous governmental regulations\nand comprehensive oversight by a variety of\nregulatory agencies and enforcement\nauthorities. These regulations and the manner\nin which they are implemented can have a\nsignificant impact on our businesses and\noperations and our ability to grow and expand.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a\nBHC and a financial holding company, with the\nFederal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC\nBank is a federally chartered bank, with the\nOCC as its primary regulator. In addition, our\nbusinesses are subject to regulation by\nmultiple other banking, consumer protection,\nsecurities and derivatives regulatory bodies.\nWe are also subject to the jurisdiction of\ncriminal and civil enforcement authorities.\n\nAs a result, we are subject to numerous laws\nand regulations involving both our business\nand organization, with multiple regulators or\nagencies having supervisory or enforcement\noversight over aspects of our business. These\nlaws, regulations and supervisory activities\nare intended to promote the safety and\nsoundness of financial institutions, financial\nmarket stability, the transparency and\nliquidity of financial markets, and consumer\nand investor protection and prevent money\nlaundering and terrorist financing. In\naddition to regulation in the U.S., we are\nalso subject to foreign regulation to a\nlimited extent as a result of our business\nactivities outside the U.S.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our\npermissible activities and investments and\nrequire compliance with provisions designed to\nprotect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary,\nand other customers, and for the protection of\ncustomer information, among other things. We\nalso are subject to laws and regulations\ndesigned to combat money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and transactions with persons,\ncompanies or foreign governments designated by\nU.S. authorities.\n\nOver time, the scope of the laws and\nregulations affecting our businesses, as well\nas the number of requirements or limitations\nimposed by legislative or regulatory actions,\nhas increased, and we expect to continue to\nface substantial regulatory oversight and new\nor revised regulatory requirements or\ninitiatives. Legislative or regulatory actions\ncan result in increased compliance costs,\nreduced business opportunities, or new\nrequirements and limitations on how we conduct\nour business.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a\nsource of financial and managerial strength\nfor its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve\ncould require PNC to commit resources to PNC\nBank when doing so is not otherwise in the\ninterests of PNC or its shareholders or\ncreditors.\n\nThe results of routine and non-routine\nsupervisory or examination activities by our\nregulators, including actual or perceived\ncompliance failures, could result in\nlimitations on our ability to enter into\ncertain transactions, engage in new\nactivities, expand geographically, make\nacquisitions, or obtain necessary regulatory\napprovals in connection therewith. These\nactivities also could result\n\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nin significant fines, penalties, or required\ncorrective actions, some of which could be\nexpensive and difficult to implement. As we\nexpand our product and service offerings into\nadditional states or countries, either through\norganic growth or acquisition, we will face\nincreases in state or foreign regulation\naffecting our operations. Different approaches\nto regulation by different jurisdictions could\nmaterially increase our compliance costs or\nrisks of non-compliance.\n\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate\npolicies and procedures designed to comply,\nwith regulatory requirements and expectations\nexposes us to the risk of damages, fines and\nregulatory penalties and other regulatory or\nenforcement actions or consequences, such as\nlimitations on activities otherwise\npermissible for us or additional requirements\nfor engaging in new activities, and could also\ninjure our reputation with customers and\nothers with whom we do business.\n\nSee the immediately following Risk Factor for\na discussion of risks associated with capital\nand liquidity regulation. Also see Supervision\nand Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for\nmore information concerning the regulation of\nPNC, including those areas that have been\nreceiving a high level of regulatory focus.\nNote 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report also discusses some of the\nregulation applicable to us.\n\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect our business,\noperations and ability to pay dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements established\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nrespectively. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the Basel\nCommittee and then applied, with adjustments,\nin each country by the appropriate domestic\nregulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory\nagencies have the ability to apply stricter\ncapital and liquidity standards than those\ndeveloped by Basel Committee. In several\ninstances, the U.S. banking agencies have done\nso with respect to U.S. banking organizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity, and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of our capital\nand liquidity, impact our business activities\nand may prevent us from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force us to take actions\ncontrary to their interests. For example,\nPNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders is\nsubject to PNC\u2019s compliance with its SCB,\nwhich is determined at least annually through\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. The\nFederal Reserve also has imposed additional\nlimitations on capital distributions through\nthe first quarter of 2021 by CCAR\nparticipating BHCs (including PNC) and may\nextend these limitations, potentially in\nmodified form. In addition, capital and\nliquidity requirements may impact the amount\nand type of loans we make. We may be\nconstrained in our ability to expand, either\norganically or through acquisitions. We may be\nforced to sell or refrain from acquiring\nassets where the capital requirements appear\ninconsistent with the assets\u2019 underlying\nrisks. In addition, liquidity standards\nrequire us to maintain holdings of highly\nliquid short-term investments, thereby\nreducing our ability to invest in longer-term\nor less liquid assets, even if more desirable\nfrom an earnings, balance sheet or interest\nrate risk management perspective.\n\nThe Basel Committee continues to engage in\ncapital- and liquidity-related initiatives.\nFor example, the Basel Committee in 2017\nfinalized additional, significant changes to\nthe international capital framework for\nbanking organizations. See the Supervision and\nRegulation section included in Item 1 of this\nReport. As it is unclear, at this time,\nwhether or how these initiatives will be\nimplemented in the U.S., we are unable to\nestimate what potential impact such\ninitiatives may have on us.\n\nIn 2020, the regulatory agencies issued a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing the CECL accounting standard. PNC\nelected to adopt this optional transition\nprovision effective March 31, 2020. As a\nresult, our regulatory capital does not\ncurrently reflect the full impact of CECL.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nare subject to regular review and revision by\nthe Basel Committee and the U.S. banking\nagencies. Future changes to the capital and\nliquidity rules may require PNC or PNC Bank to\nmaintain more or higher quality capital or\ngreater liquidity, which would likely increase\nsome of the potential adverse effects\ndescribed above.\n\nThe regulatory capital and liquidity\nframeworks as well as certain other prudential\nrequirements and standards that are applicable\nto PNC are discussed in the Supervision and\nRegulation section included in Item 1 of this\nReport and the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nThe likely discontinuance of the submission of\nrates for the calculation of LIBOR presents\nrisks to the financial instruments originated,\nheld or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a\nreference rate .\n\nAs a large financial institution, a\nsignificant portion of our transactions\ninvolve variable or adjusting interest rates\nthat are calculated by adding a contractually\ndefined credit spread to a base or reference\nrate. For many years, LIBOR has been used as a\nreference rate for a substantial majority of\nour transactions involving variable or\nadjustable interest, including those in which\nwe lend money, issue securities, or purchase\nand sell securities issued by others, as well\nas many derivative transactions that we enter\ninto to manage our or our customers\u2019 risk. We\nalso service financial instruments entered\ninto by others that use LIBOR as the reference\nrate.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 21\nLIBOR is derived from the rates at which LIBOR\npanel banks borrow from other global banks.\nLIBOR is accordingly viewed as a \u201ccredit-\nsensitive\u201d rate as the rates submitted by\npanel banks on which LIBOR is based reflect\nthe credit risk associated with the submitting\nbanks.\n\nWe currently anticipate that non-USD LIBOR\nwill cease to be available after year end 2021\nand that the most widely used USD LIBOR tenor\nsettings will cease after June 30, 2023. The\nFederal Reserve and other official sector\nrepresentatives have also communicated\nguidance that supervised institutions should\nstop entering into new USD LIBOR contracts no\nlater than year end 2021. Accordingly, we are\npreparing for the likelihood of LIBOR\ncessation.\n\nAt present, SOFR is expected to be the\nalternative reference rate that will replace\nLIBOR for most types of transactions.\n\nSOFR is viewed as a \u201criskless rate\u201d as it is\nderived from rates on overnight U.S. Treasury\nrepurchase transactions, which are essentially\novernight loans secured by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, which are largely viewed as not\npresenting credit risk. Because SOFR is an\novernight rate derived from observations of\nactual transactions, the rate can be volatile,\nespecially if there are disruptions in the\nunderlying repurchase market, but any daily\nvolatility historically does not create\nvolatility when rates are cumulatively\nmeasured over customary LIBOR terms (e.g., one\nmonth or three months).\n\nChanging to SOFR or another riskless rate\ncould result in a value transfer between\ncontracting parties to instruments originally\nbased on LIBOR. Historically, in periods of\neconomic or financial industry stress,\nriskless rates that are analogous to SOFR have\nbeen relatively stable. In contrast, LIBOR,\nwhich is designed to reflect the credit risk\nof banks, has widened relative to riskless\nrates, reflecting increased uncertainty\nregarding the credit-worthiness of banks.\nAccordingly, assuming that SOFR will behave\nlike its historical analogs, an instrument\nthat transitions from LIBOR to SOFR may not\nyield identical economic outcomes for each\ncontracting party to an instrument had the\ninstrument continued to reference LIBOR.\nSimilarly, SOFR, because it is riskless, tends\nto be a lower rate than LIBOR. To address\nthese differences between LIBOR and SOFR,\ncertain industry recommended LIBOR fallback\nprovisions include a concept of an adjustment\nspread that is applied when a LIBOR-based\ncontract falls back to SOFR and that is\ncalculated based on a five-year median look-\nback of the historical spot difference between\nthe applicable LIBOR tenor and the applicable\nSOFR tenor. However, because any such\nadjustment spread will be based on a\nhistorical median, it is likely that the\nadjustment spread may not reflect the spot\ndifference between LIBOR and SOFR at certain\npoints in time and there may be a value\ntransfer between the contracting parties over\nthe life of the instrument because the all-in\nrate applied to a contract, even taking into\naccount the spread adjustment, might have\nbehaved differently over the life of the\ninstrument in the absence of LIBOR cessation.\n\nAny value transfer could be financially\nadverse or beneficial to us or to our other\ncontracting parties to that instrument (such\nas a borrower, derivative counterparty, or\nbond holder). Impacts from a change in\nreference rate would likely include changes to\nthe yield on, and value of, loans or\nsecurities held by us, amounts paid on\nsecurities we have issued, amounts received\nand paid on derivative instruments we have\nentered into and the trading market for LIBOR-\nbased securities. Any theoretical benefit to\nus could result in counterparty\ndissatisfaction, which, in turn could lead to\nlitigation, potentially as class actions, or\nother adverse consequences, including\ndissatisfied customers or impaired\nrelationships with financial institution\ncounterparties resulting in loss of business.\nAs a result, over the life of a transaction\nthat transitions from LIBOR to a new reference\nrate, our monetary obligations to our\ncounterparty (or their obligations to us) and\nthe yield we receive (or pay) from the\ntransaction with that counterparty may change\nfrom that which would have resulted from a\ncontinuation of LIBOR.\n\nAnother set of risks associated with LIBOR\ncessation relates to how the transition from\nLIBOR to another rate will be effected. For\nsome instruments, the method of transitioning\nto a new reference rate may be challenging,\nespecially where the contract does not provide\nfor a transition upon LIBOR cessation or the\nrelevant contractual language relating to a\npotential transition is ambiguous or\ninadequate under the circumstances.\n\nFor example, the vast majority of LIBOR-based\ninterest rate derivative contracts executed\nprior to January 25, 2021, do not include\nadequate fallbacks for LIBOR cessation. In\nresponse, the industry trade group for\nderivatives (ISDA), published a protocol\npursuant to which industry participants can\nagree with any other industry participant that\nadheres to the protocol to include ISDA\u2019s new\nLIBOR fallback provisions into legacy\nderivatives contracts. Although we have\nadhered to the ISDA protocol, it is possible\nthat many \u201cend users\u201d of swaps, i.e., our\nborrowers who have hedged their interest rate\npayment obligations, may not adhere. In\naddition, there are differences between the\nnew ISDA fallback provisions and the fallback\nprovisions that have been proposed for loans,\nwhich differences could result in a mismatch\nbetween the reference rate or other economics\nin our borrowers\u2019 legacy derivatives contracts\nand their loans for which such derivatives\ncontracts are intended as a hedge. For these\nend-user counterparties, one-on-one\nnegotiation with each counterparty will be\nnecessary in order to amend legacy swaps to\nadequately address LIBOR cessation. If we are\nunable to agree to appropriate LIBOR cessation\nprovisions with these swaps counterparties,\nthere will be uncertainty as to how to value\nand effect our rights and obligations under\nour legacy swap contracts. Although\nlegislative solutions to address LIBOR\ncessation in derivative contracts have been\nproposed, there is no assurance such solutions\nwill be implemented, and we may seek to\nnegotiate with impacted counterparties or, if\nnot possible, effect reference rate transition\nthrough other means. Addressing transition\nunder these circumstances may be challenging\nor ineffective, could result in litigation,\nand in some cases may involve concession on\nour part that has the effect of reducing the\nvalue of the instrument to us.\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nWe have other contracts that do contemplate\nLIBOR cessation but do so in a manner that may\ncreate other risks. For example, some\ncontracts provide for selecting replacement\nrates in a manner that presents significant\nchallenges (such as by assuming that there\nwould be a rate calculated substantially in\nthe same manner as LIBOR is) or that gives us\nor another party absolute discretion to select\na rate. Some provide for determination of a\nreference rate without providing for\nadjustment of the credit spread. In these\ntypes of cases, there will likely be\nuncertainty surrounding transition, with all\nof the risks described in this Risk Factor.\n\nTransitioning from LIBOR to alternative rates\nalso may result in operational errors during\nthe transition such that the replacement rate\nis not applied in a timely manner or is\nincorrectly applied. This is particularly true\ngiven the volume of contracts that will\nrequire transition and the diversity of\npotential approaches to transition and given\nthe possibility that the period during which\nthe transition will need to take place may\nhave a short duration.\n\nSimilarly, our failure to successfully\nimplement transition from LIBOR to alternative\nrates could result in regulatory scrutiny and\nactions by our regulators including fines and\nother supervisory sanctions.\n\nIt is also possible that LIBOR quotes will\nbecome unavailable prior to the currently\nanticipated cessation dates. In that case, the\nrisks associated with the transition to an\nalternative reference rate will be accelerated\nand magnified. These risks may also be\nincreased due to the shorter time for\npreparing for the transition.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, we have established an\nenterprise LIBOR transition program, described\nin the Market Risk Management portion of the\nRisk Management section in Item 7 of this\nReport. Any failure of this program to\nappropriately assess and mitigate risk and\ndeliver in a timely manner on operationalizing\nour ability to transition from LIBOR could\nmagnify the risks previously outlined.\n\nNew customer privacy initiatives will impose\nadditional operational burdens on PNC, may\nlimit our ability to pursue desirable business\ninitiatives and increase the risks associated\nwith any future use of customer data.\n\nRecently there has been an increase in\nlegislative and regulatory efforts to protect\nthe privacy of consumer data. Significant\nexamples include the General Data Protection\nRegulation of the European Union and the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act. These\ninitiatives, among other things, limit how\ncompanies can use customer data and impose\nobligations on companies in their management\nof such data. Financial services companies\nsuch as PNC necessarily gather, maintain and\nuse a significant amount of customer data.\nThese types of initiatives increase compliance\ncomplexity and related costs, result in\nsignificant financial penalties for compliance\nfailures, and limit our ability to develop new\nproducts or respond to technological changes.\nSuch legal requirements also could heighten\nthe reputational impact of perceived misuses\nof customer data by us, our vendors, or others\nwho gain unauthorized access to our customer\ndata. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar\nrequirements that impose different and\npotentially inconsistent compliance burdens.\nThe impacts will be greater to the extent\nrequirements vary across jurisdictions.\n\nSocietal responses to climate change could\nadversely affect our business and performance,\nincluding indirectly through impacts on our\ncustomers.\n\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate\nchange have led and will continue to lead to\ngovernmental efforts around the world to\nmitigate those impacts. Consumers and\nbusinesses also are changing their behavior as\na result of these concerns. PNC and its\ncustomers will need to respond to new laws and\nregulations as well as consumer and business\npreferences resulting from climate change\nconcerns. We and our customers may face cost\nincreases, asset value reductions, operating\nprocess changes, and the like as a result of\ngovernmental actions or societal responses to\nclimate change. The impact on our customers\nwill likely vary depending on their specific\nattributes, including their reliance on or\nrole in carbon intensive activities as well as\ntheir exposure to the effects of climate\nchange. Among the impacts to PNC could be a\ndrop in demand for our products and services,\nparticularly in certain sectors. In addition,\nwe could face reductions in creditworthiness\non the part of some customers or in the value\nof assets securing loans, pressure from\nindividuals or groups to cease doing business\nwith certain companies or sectors, or\nadditional regulatory restrictions or costs\nassociated with providing products or services\nto certain companies or sectors. The Risk\nFactor headed \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse\nimpact on our business due to damage to our\nreputation\u201d has further discussion of risks\nassociated with activist pressure. Our efforts\nto take these risks into account in making\nlending and other decisions, including by\nincreasing our business with climate-friendly\ncompanies, may not be effective in protecting\nus from the negative impact of new laws and\nregulations or changes in consumer or business\nbehavior, including those resulting from\nactivist pressure.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Use of Technology      \n                                              \nThe use of technology is critical to our\nability to maintain or enhance the\ncompetitiveness of our businesses.\n\nAs a large financial services company, we\nhandle a substantial volume of customer and\nother financial transactions. As a result, we\nrely heavily on information systems to conduct\nour business and to process, record and\nmonitor our transactions and those of our\ncustomers. Over time, we have seen more\ncustomer usage of technological solutions for\nfinancial needs as well as higher expectations\nof customers and regulators regarding\neffective and safe systems operation. In many\ncases, the effective use of technology\nincreases\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 23\nefficiency and enables financial institutions\nto better serve customers. As a result of\nthese factors, the financial services industry\nis undergoing rapid technological change with\nfrequent introductions of new technology-\ndriven products and services. Examples include\nexpanded use of cloud computing, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, virtual and\naugmented reality, biometric authentication,\nvoice and natural language, and data\nprotection enhancements, as well as increased\nonline and mobile device interaction with\ncustomers. We expect these trends to continue\nfor the foreseeable future. Change is coming\nboth from traditional banking companies and\nnon-bank financial technology companies\noffering financial products and services,\nparticularly payment services and lending. Our\nability to succeed is dependent on the\ntechnologies we employ and offer our customers\nand the extent to which we at least keep pace\nwith, if not exceed, our competitors\u2019 progress\nand our customers\u2019 needs and expectations.\n\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer\nbehavior and expectations, as well as\ncompetitive pressures, we have been investing\nin technology and connectivity. We are seeking\nto automate functions previously performed\nmanually, facilitate the ability of customers\nto engage in financial transactions, and\notherwise enhance the customer experience with\nrespect to our products and services. This\neffort has involved the expenditure of\nconsiderable amounts of funds and other\nresources. A failure to maintain or enhance\nour competitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because we fail to\nanticipate customer expectations or because\nour technological developments fail to perform\nas desired or are not rolled out in a timely\nmanner or because we fail to keep pace with\nour competitors, would likely cause us to lose\nmarket share or incur additional expense. Our\nability to maintain or enhance our relative\ntechnological position is in part dependent on\nour ability to attract and retain talented\nemployees in these fields, which, due to\noverall demand, is increasingly difficult.\n\nOur use of technology is dependent on having\nthe right to use the underlying intellectual\nproperty.\n\nIn some cases, we develop internally the\nintellectual property embedded in the\ntechnology we use. In others, we or our\nvendors license it from others. Regardless of\nthe source of the intellectual property, if\nanother person or entity were deemed to own\nintellectual property rights infringed by our\nactivities, we could be responsible for\nsignificant damages covering past activities\nand substantial fees to continue to engage in\nthese types of activities. It also is possible\nthat we could be prevented from using\ntechnology important to our business for at\nleast a period of time. In such a\ncircumstance, there may be no alternative\ntechnology for us to use or an appropriate\nalternative technology might be expensive to\nobtain. Protections offered by those from whom\nwe license technology against these risks may\nbe inadequate to cover fully any losses. Over\ntime, there have been instances where\ntechnology used by PNC and other financial\ninstitutions has been alleged to have\ninfringed patents held by others, and in some\ncases we, as well as other financial\ninstitutions, have suffered related losses.\n\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from\ninterruptions in the effective operation of\nour information systems and other technology.\n\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and\nresiliency of our information systems and\nother technology has become more important and\nmore challenging, and the costs involved in\nthat effort continue to be high. The risks of\noperational failures in the use of these\nsystems result from a variety of factors. We\nare vulnerable to the impact of failures of\nour systems to operate as needed or intended.\nFailures leading to materially adverse impacts\ncould include those resulting from human\nerror, unexpected transaction volumes, or\noverall design or performance issues. In\naddition, our ability to use our technology\neffectively could be impacted due to bad\nweather, disasters, bad actors, terrorism and\nthe like. Such events could affect our systems\ndirectly or limit our ability to use our\ntechnology due to effects on key underlying\ninfrastructure. In some cases, the risk\nresults from the potential for bad acts on the\npart of others, discussed in more detail in\nthe Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are vulnerable to\nthe risk of third party breaches of data\nsecurity affecting the functioning of systems\nor the confidentiality of information, either\nat PNC or at third parties handling PNC\ninformation.\u201d\n\nWe also rely on information systems maintained\nby other companies. We use other companies\nboth to provide products and services directly\nto us and to assist in providing products and\nservices to our customers. Others provide the\ninfrastructure that supports, for example,\ncommunications, payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems, or information processing\nand storage. These companies range from those\nproviding highly sophisticated information\nprocessing to those that provide fundamental\nservices, such as electric power and\ntelecommunications. In some cases, these other\ncompanies themselves utilize third parties to\nsupport their delivery of products and\nservices to us and our customers. Systems\nmaintained by or for these other companies are\ngenerally subject to many of the same risks we\nface with respect to our systems and thus\ntheir issues could have a negative impact on\nPNC. We necessarily have less ability to\nprovide oversight over other companies\u2019\ninformation systems.\n\nA number of our customers choose to use\nfinancial applications (apps) that allow them\nto view banking and other financial account\ninformation, often held at different financial\ninstitutions, on a single platform, to monitor\nthe performance of their investments, to\ncompare financial and investment products, to\nmake payments or transfer funds, and otherwise\nto help manage their finances and investments.\nFinancial apps often ask users to provide\ntheir secure banking log-in information and\ncredentials (username and password) so the\napps can link to users\u2019 accounts at financial\ninstitutions. Companies offering these apps\nfrequently use third-party data aggregators \u2013\nbehind-the-scenes technology companies that\nserve as a data-gathering service provider \u2013\nto deliver customer financial data that is\nused by the financial apps. To do this, data\naggregators are provided with customers\u2019 log-\nin information and credentials, which allows\nthe aggregators to access the customers\u2019\nonline account and \u201cscrape\u201d the customers\u2019\ndata, often on a daily or even more frequent\nbasis. That same information has the potential\nto facilitate fraud if it is not properly\nprotected. In fact, the Director of the FinCEN\nhas stated that FinCEN has seen high\nincidences of fraud, including ACH fraud,\ncredit card fraud, and wire fraud,\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nenabled through the use of synthetic\nidentities and through account takeovers via\nthese platforms. In some cases, cybercriminals\nappear to be using such data aggregators and\nintegrators to facilitate account takeovers\nand fraudulent wires. PNC has and may continue\nto face increased financial exposure due to\nfraudulent activity associated with the\nincreased use of these apps and data\naggregators. Even where PNC does not have\nresponsibility for fraud losses associated\nwith these apps and data aggregators, PNC\ncould suffer increased reputational harm when\nsuch losses occur.\n\nAlthough we regularly update and replace\nsystems that we depend on as our needs evolve\nand technology improves, we continue to\nutilize some older systems that may not be as\nreliable as newer ones. In addition, the\nimplementation of and transition to new or\nupdated systems creates risks related to\nassociated timing and costs, disruptions in\nfunctionality for customers and longer term\nfailures to achieve desired improvements.\n\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or\nsecurity breach of any of our information or\ncommunications systems, or the systems of\nother companies on which we rely, could result\nin a wide variety of adverse consequences to\nus. This risk is greater if the issue is\nwidespread, extends for a significant period\nof time, or results in financial losses to our\ncustomers. The consequences of failures to\noperate systems properly can include\ndisruptions to our ability to use our\naccounting, deposit, loan, payment and other\nsystems. Such events could also cause errors\nin transactions or impair system functionality\nwith customers, vendors or other parties.\nPossible adverse consequences also include\ndamage to our reputation or a loss of customer\nbusiness, which could occur even if the\nnegative impact on customers was de minimis.\nWe also could face litigation or additional\nregulatory scrutiny. This in turn could lead\nto liability or other sanctions, including\nfines and penalties or reimbursement of\nadversely affected customers. Even if we do\nnot suffer any material adverse consequences\nas a result of events affecting us directly,\ninformation systems issues at other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a general loss of\ncustomer confidence in financial institutions,\nincluding us. Also, system problems, including\nthose resulting from third party attacks,\nwhether at PNC or at our competitors, would\nlikely broadly increase legislative,\nregulatory and customer concerns regarding the\nfunctioning, safety and security of such\nsystems. In that case, we would expect to\nincur even higher levels of costs with respect\nto prevention and mitigation of these risks.\n\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of third party\nbreaches of data security affecting the\nfunctioning of systems or the confidentiality\nof information, either at PNC or at third\nparties handling PNC information.\n\nWe are faced with ongoing, bordering on\ncontinual, efforts by others to breach data\nsecurity at financial institutions or with\nrespect to financial transactions. Some of\nthese involve efforts to enter our systems\ndirectly by going through or around our\nsecurity protections. Others involve the use\nof social engineering schemes to gain access\nto confidential information from our\nemployees, customers or vendors. Most\ncorporate and commercial transactions are now\nhandled electronically, and our retail\ncustomers increasingly use online access and\nmobile devices to bank with us. The ability to\nconduct business with us in this manner\ndepends on the transmission and storage of\nconfidential information in electronic form.\nAs a result, efforts by bad actors to engage\nin various types of cyber attacks pose serious\nrisks to our business and reputation. The same\nrisks are presented by attacks potentially\naffecting information held by third parties on\nour behalf or accessed by third parties,\nincluding those offering financial apps, on\nbehalf of our customers.\n\nIn the ordinary course, we maintain and\nprocess vast amounts of information about us,\nour customers and our employees. This\ninformation tends to be confidential or\nproprietary and much of it is highly\nsensitive. The highly sensitive information\nincludes information sufficient to support\nidentity theft and personal health\ninformation, as well as information regarding\nbusiness plans and financial performance that\nhas not been made public. One way in which bad\nactors attempt to harm us is by seeking access\nto some of this confidential or proprietary\ninformation, often with the intent of stealing\nfrom or defrauding us or our customers. In\nother cases, they seek to disrupt our ability\nto conduct our business, including by\ndestroying or impairing our access to\ninformation maintained by us.\n\nOur customers often use their own devices,\nsuch as computers, smartphones and tablets, to\ndo business with us and may provide their PNC\ncustomer information (including passwords) to\na third party in connection with obtaining\nservices from the third party, including those\noffering financial apps. Although we take\nsteps to provide safety and security for our\ncustomers\u2019 transactions with us and their\ncustomer information to the extent they are\nutilizing their own devices or providing third\nparties access to their accounts, our ability\nto assure such safety and security is\nnecessarily limited.\n\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued\ncredit and debit cards to pay for transactions\nwith retailers and other businesses, there is\nalso the risk of data security breaches at\nthose other businesses covering PNC account\ninformation. When our customers use PNC issued\ncards to make purchases from those businesses,\ncard account information often is provided to\nthe business. If the business\u2019s systems that\nprocess or store card account information are\nsubject to a data security breach, holders of\nour cards who have made purchases from that\nbusiness may experience fraud on their card\naccounts. We can be responsible for\nreimbursing our customers for such fraudulent\ntransactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as\nwell as for other costs related to data\nsecurity compromise events, such as replacing\ncards associated with compromised card\naccounts, but to date such losses have not\nbeen material to us. In addition, we provide\ncard transaction processing services to some\nmerchant customers under agreements we have\nwith payment networks such as Visa and\nMastercard. Under these agreements, we may be\nresponsible for certain losses and penalties\nif one of our merchant customers suffers a\ndata security breach. Over the last few years,\nseveral large companies disclosed that they\nhad suffered substantial data security\nbreaches compromising millions of user\naccounts and credentials. To date, our losses\nand costs related to these types of breaches,\nincluding those where some of the accounts\naffected were with PNC, have not been\nmaterial. Other similar events in the\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 25\nfuture could be more significant to us.\nMoreover, to the extent more consumer\nconfidential information becomes available to\nbad actors through the cumulative effect of\ndata breaches at companies generally, bad\nactors may find it easier to use such\ninformation to gain access to our customer\naccounts.\n\nOther cyber attacks are not focused on gaining\naccess to credit card or user credential\ninformation, but instead seek access to a\nrange of other types of confidential\ninformation, such as internal emails and other\nforms of customer financial information.\nRansomware attacks have sought to deny access\nto data and possibly shut down systems and\ndevices maintained by target companies. In a\nransomware attack, system data is encrypted or\naccess is otherwise denied, accompanied by a\ndemand for ransom to restore access to the\ndata. To date, our losses and costs related to\nthese types of attacks have not been material,\nbut ransomware attacks have increased in\nrecent years and there is no guarantee that\nfuture attacks will not be successful.\n\nA number of companies have fallen victim to\nBEC scams in recent years. BEC scams involve\nusing social engineering to cause employees to\nwire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken\nbelief that the requests were made by a\ncompany executive or established vendor. While\nwe have not experienced material losses from\nBEC scams to date, some of our commercial\ncustomers have been victimized. Attacks on our\ncustomers may put these relationships at risk,\nparticularly if customers\u2019 ability to continue\noperations is impaired due to the losses\nsuffered.\n\nOther attacks in recent years have included\nDDoS attacks, in which individuals or\norganizations flood commercial websites with\nextraordinarily high volumes of traffic with\nthe goal of disrupting the ability of\ncommercial enterprises to process transactions\nand possibly making their websites unavailable\nto customers for extended periods of time. We\n(as well as other financial services\ncompanies) have been subject to such attacks.\n\nIn addition to threats from external sources,\ninsider threats represent a significant risk\nto us. Insiders, including those having\nlegitimate access to our systems and the\ninformation contained in them, have the\neasiest opportunity to make inappropriate use\nof the systems and information. Addressing\nthat risk requires understanding not only how\nto protect us from unauthorized use and\ndisclosure of data, but also how to engage\nbehavioral analytics and other tools to\nidentify potential internal threats before any\ndamage is done.\n\nTo date, none of these types of attacks have\nhad a material impact on us. Nonetheless, we\ncannot entirely block efforts by bad actors to\nharm us. And our efforts to prevent\nsignificant harm from attacks may be\ninsufficient. While we maintain insurance\ncoverage that may cover certain aspects of\ncyber risks, such insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient to cover all losses. As a result,\nwe could suffer material financial and\nreputational losses in the future from any of\nthese or other types of attacks or the public\nperception that such an attack on our systems\nhas been successful, whether or not this\nperception is correct. Attacks on others, some\nof which have led to serious adverse\nconsequences, demonstrate the risks posed by\nnew and evolving types of cyber attacks. Our\nability to protect confidential or proprietary\ninformation is even more limited with respect\nto information held by third parties. We may\nsuffer reputational damage or legal liability\nfor unauthorized access to customer\ninformation held by third parties, even if we\nwere in fact not responsible for preventing\nsuch access and had no reasonable way of\npreventing it.\n\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk\nof failures or breaches occurring in our\ninformation systems and to mitigate the impact\nwhen they do.\n\nWe have policies, procedures and systems\n(including cyber security and business\ncontinuity programs) designed to prevent or\nlimit the effect of possible failures,\ninterruptions or breaches in security of\ninformation systems. In recent years, we have\ndevoted significant resources towards\nimproving the reliability of our systems and\ntheir security against external and internal\nthreats and expect to continue to do so in the\nfuture. We design our business continuity and\nother information and technology risk\nmanagement programs to manage our capabilities\nto provide services in the case of an event\nresulting in material disruptions of business\nactivities affecting our employees,\nfacilities, technology or suppliers. We cannot\nguarantee the effectiveness of our policies,\nprocedures and systems to protect us in any\nparticular future situation, nor the\neffectiveness of our oversight of risk at\nthird parties. Our ability to implement\npolicies, procedures and systems designed to\nprevent or limit the effect of possible\nfailures, interruptions or breaches in\nsecurity of information systems with respect\nto third party systems and the financial\nservices industry infrastructure is\nnecessarily limited. Should an adverse event\naffecting another company\u2019s systems occur, we\nmay not have financial protection from the\nother company sufficient to compensate us or\notherwise protect us from the consequences.\n\nMethods used by others to attack information\nsystems change frequently (with generally\nincreasing sophistication). A new method of\nattack often is not recognized until launched\nagainst a target. Attacks in some cases appear\nto be supported by foreign governments or\nother well-financed entities and often\noriginate from less regulated and remote areas\naround the world. As a result, we may be\nunable to implement adequate preventive\nmeasures to address these methods in advance\nof attacks.\n\nEven with our proactive and defensive measures\nin place, adverse events are likely to occur\nand there remains the risk that one or more\nsuch events would be material to PNC. Our\nability to mitigate the adverse consequences\nof such occurrences is in part dependent on\nthe quality of our business continuity\nplanning, our ability to understand threats to\nus from a holistic perspective, and our\nability to anticipate the timing and nature of\nany such event that occurs, with novel or\nunusual events posing a greater risk. It is\nalso the case that an adverse event can go\nundetected for a period of time, with the\nadverse consequences likely greater the longer\nit takes to discover the\n\n26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nproblem. In many cases, it also depends on the\npreparedness and responses of national or\nregional governments, including emergency\nresponders, or on the part of other\norganizations and businesses with which we\ndeal.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Business of Banking    \n                                              \nOur business and financial results are subject\nto risks associated with the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business. It results from, among\nother things, extending credit to customers,\npurchasing securities, and entering into\nfinancial derivative transactions and certain\nguarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our\nmost significant risks, particularly given the\nhigh percentage of our assets represented\ndirectly or indirectly by loans and securities\nand the importance of lending activity to our\noverall business. We manage credit risk by\nassessing and monitoring the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties, by\ndiversifying our loan portfolio and by\ninvesting primarily in high quality\nsecurities.\n\nA borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan can be\nadversely affected by many factors. Individual\nborrowers can be affected, for example, by\ndeclines in income, job losses, health issues\nor family issues. Commercial borrowers can be\naffected, for example, by poor business\nperformance, changes in customer behavior or\ncatastrophic losses. Weakness in the economy\nor in financial markets would typically\nadversely impact the ability of our borrowers\nto repay outstanding loans. We are exposed to\nincreased credit risk if we fail to evaluate\nproperly at origination the likely ability of\na borrower to repay a loan. Properly\nestimating the current and potential value of\nany collateral pledged to support the loan\nalso is critical to effectively managing\ncredit risk. A failure to identify declining\ncreditworthiness of a borrower or declining\ncollateral value at a time when remedial\nactions could reduce our exposure also\nincreases credit risk. Any decrease in our\nborrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans would result\nin higher levels of nonperforming loans, net\ncharge-offs, provision for credit losses and\nvaluation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nManaging credit risk effectively also relies\non forecasts of future overall economic\nconditions, which are inherently imperfect.\n\nIn addition to credit risk associated with our\nlending activities, we have credit risk\narising from many other types of business\nrelationships. Routine transactions give us\ncredit exposure to brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds, other institutional clients, as\nwell as vendors and other non-financial\nentities.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often\nhave heightened credit exposure to a\nparticular industry, region or financial\nmarket. As an example, loans secured by\ncommercial and residential real estate\ntypically represent a significant percentage\nof our overall credit portfolio. They also\nrepresent a portion of the assets underlying\nour investment securities. Although there are\nlimitations on the extent of total exposure to\nan individual or business borrower, we may\nhave outsized exposure to a particular\nborrower experiencing financial distress.\nEvents adversely affecting specific customers\nor counterparties, industries, regions or\nfinancial markets, including a decline in\ntheir creditworthiness or a worsening overall\nrisk profile, could materially and adversely\naffect us. Declining economic conditions also\nmay impact commercial borrowers more than\nconsumer borrowers, or vice versa. Thus, the\nconcentration and mix of our loan portfolio\nmay affect the severity of the impact of a\nrecession on us.\n\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when\ncollateral held by us to secure obligations to\nus cannot be realized upon, including as a\nresult of legal or regulatory changes, or is\nliquidated at prices that are not sufficient\nto recover the full amount of the loan or\nderivative exposure due us.\n\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and\nlease portfolio through our ACL estimated\nunder CECL. Under CECL, the ACL reflects\nexpected lifetime losses, which could lead to\nvolatility in the allowance and the provision\nfor credit losses as economic forecasts,\nactual credit performance and other factors\nused in the loss estimating process change. We\nalso have reserves for unfunded loan\ncommitments and letters of credit. Changes are\nreflected in net income through provision for\ncredit losses. An increase in credit risk\nwould likely lead to an increase in provision\nfor credit losses with a resulting reduction\nin our net income and would increase our\nallowance. An improvement of economic\nconditions or our economic outlook,\nparticularly following a period of poor\neconomic conditions, has and could continue to\nresult in a recapture of provision for credit\nlosses for a period of time with a resulting\nincrease in our net income and decrease in our\nallowance that is not likely to be sustained.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted\nboth commercial borrowers and consumers. In\naddition, the declines in GDP and increases in\nunemployment associated with the pandemic, and\nresponsive measures to manage it, have\nsignificantly impacted the economic and\nqualitative factors used for purposes of our\nestimation of credit losses under CECL. For a\ndiscussion of the increased credit risk\narising from the pandemic and its impact to\nour estimation of credit losses, see the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had\nand is likely to continue to have an adverse\neffect, possibly materially, on our overall\nbusiness and financial performance.\u201d\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 27\nOur business and financial performance are\nimpacted significantly by market interest\nrates and movements in those rates.\n\nAs a result of the high percentage of our\nassets and liabilities that are in the form of\ninterest-bearing or interest-related\ninstruments, changes in interest rates, in the\nshape of the yield curve, or in spreads\nbetween different market interest rates can\nhave a material effect on our business, our\nprofitability and the value of our financial\nassets and liabilities. For example:\n\n\u2022 Changes in interest rates or interest rate\nspreads affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities, which\nimpacts our overall net interest income and\nmargin as well as our profitability.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can affect the ability of\nborrowers to meet obligations under variable\nor adjustable rate loans and other debt\ninstruments, and can, in turn, increase our\ncredit losses on those assets.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can decrease the demand for\ninterest rate-based products and services,\nincluding loans and deposit accounts.\n\n\u2022 Such changes affect our hedging of various\nforms of market and interest rate risk and may\ndecrease the effectiveness of those hedges in\nhelping to manage such risks.\n\n\u2022 Movements in interest rates also affect\nmortgage prepayment speeds and could result in\nimpairments of mortgage servicing assets or\notherwise affect the profitability of such\nassets.\n\n\u2022 Increases in interest rates likely lower the\nprice we would receive on fixed-rate customer\nobligations if we were to sell them.\n\nWe may also experience spread compression by\noffering higher than expected deposit rates in\norder to attract and maintain deposits as a\nresult of increased competition.\n\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments\nadjust promptly in accordance with changes in\nmarket rates, while others adjust only\nperiodically or are fixed throughout a defined\nterm. As a result, the impact of changes in\ninterest rates can be either increased or\ndiluted due to differences in the relative\nvariability of the rates paid on our\nliabilities in relation to the rates received\non our assets. The extent to which we have\nelected to hedge interest rate risk through\ninterest rate swaps also affects the impact of\nrate changes. We attempt to manage the balance\nsheet to increase our benefit or reduce\nnegative impacts from future movements in\ninterest rates, but failures to anticipate\nactual movements may have the opposite result.\n\nWhile in general higher interest rates enhance\nour ability to grow our net interest income,\nthere are risks associated with a rising\ninterest rate environment. As a general\nmatter, increasing rates tend to decrease the\nvalue of fixed-rate financial instruments held\non our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cOur business and financial\nperformance are vulnerable to the impact of\nchanges in the values of financial assets.\u201d\nAlso, customers may be less willing overall to\nborrow at higher rates. Higher interest rates\nmay indirectly affect the value of asset\nclasses such as real estate typically financed\nthrough secured loans, with a resulting\nnegative effect on collateral securing such\nloans. As another example, there may be\nincreased competitive pressures as rates on\ndeposit products rise. The benefits of higher\ninterest rates are best achieved if we can\nincrease the rates on loans and other assets\nfaster than the rates on deposits and other\nliabilities increase. We may not be able to\nachieve this result in a rising rate\nenvironment.\n\nOn the other hand, lower interest rates tend\nto have a negative impact on our net interest\nmargin, and, unless offset by higher earning\nassets, on our net interest income. Moreover,\na negative interest rate environment, in which\ninterest rates drop below zero either broadly\nor for some types of instruments, could reduce\nour net interest margin and net interest\nincome due to a likely decline in the interest\nwe could earn on loans and other earning\nassets, while also likely requiring us to pay\nto maintain our deposits with the Federal\nReserve Bank. In addition, our systems may not\nbe able to handle adequately a negative\ninterest rate environment and not all variable\nrate instruments are designed for such a\ncircumstance. The current very low interest\nrate environment increases the potential for\nnegative interest rates to occur.\n\nWe discuss the impact of governmental monetary\npolicy on interest rates in the Risk Factors\nheaded \u201cThe policies of the Federal Reserve\nand other governmental agencies have a\nsignificant impact on interest rates and\noverall financial market performance, which\nare important to our business and financial\nperformance\u201d and \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has\nhad and is likely to continue to have an\nadverse effect, possibly materially, on our\noverall business and financial performance.\u201d\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of changes in the\nvalues of financial assets.\n\nAs a financial institution, a substantial\nmajority of our assets and liabilities are\nfinancial in nature. Examples include loans,\nsecurities, servicing rights, deposits and\nborrowings. Such assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value, often significantly, due\nto movements in the financial markets or\nmarket volatility as well as developments\nspecific to the asset or liability in\nquestion. Credit-based assets and liabilities\nwill fluctuate in value due to changes in the\nperceived creditworthiness of borrowers or\nother counterparties and also due to changes\nin market interest rates.\n\nChanges in loan prepayment speeds, which often\noccur when interest rates change, impact the\nvalue of our mortgage servicing rights,\npossibly adversely. Also, the underlying value\nof assets under lease or securing an\nobligation generally decreases due to\nincreases in supply or decreases in demand for\nthe asset or deterioration in the condition of\nthe asset. This could negatively impact the\nability to collect fully on the secured\nobligation.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and\nliabilities to market and recognize such\nchanges either through net income or OCI.\nThus, gains or losses on these assets and\nliabilities can have a direct impact on our\nresults of operations, unless we have\neffectively hedged our exposures. We may need\nto record losses in the value of financial\nassets even where our expectation of realizing\nthe face value of the underlying instrument\nhas not changed. Other assets and liabilities\nare not marked to market. As a result, our\nbalance sheet does not precisely represent the\nfair market value of our financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\nIn addition, asset management revenue is\nearned primarily based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the assets being managed and thus is\nimpacted by general changes in market\nvaluations. Thus, although we are not directly\nimpacted by changes in the value of such\nassets, decreases in the value of those assets\nwould affect related Noninterest income.\n\nFor a discussion of the risks presented by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic to the values of financial\nassets, see the Risk Factor headed \u201cThe\nCOVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to\ncontinue to have an adverse effect, possibly\nmaterially, on our overall business and\nfinancial performance.\u201d\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nOur asset and liability valuations and the\ndetermination of the amount of loss allowances\nand impairments taken on our assets are highly\nsubjective. Inaccurate estimates could\nmaterially impact our results of operations or\nfinancial position.\n\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and\njudgments when assets and liabilities are\nmeasured and reported at fair value. Assets\nand liabilities carried at fair value\ninherently result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Changes in\nunderlying factors or assumptions in any of\nthe areas underlying our estimates could\nmaterially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations. During\nperiods of market disruption, it would be\ndifficult to value certain assets if trading\nbecomes less frequent and/or market data\nbecomes less observable. There may be certain\nasset classes that were historically traded in\nactive markets with significant observable\ndata that rapidly become illiquid due to\nmarket volatility, a loss in market confidence\nor other factors. In addition, we have assets\nand liabilities carried at fair value that are\nestimated using unobservable inputs that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities. The valuation of any asset or\nliability substantially based on unobservable\ninputs is necessarily less reliable than those\nbased on active trading markets. Further,\nrapidly changing and unprecedented market\nconditions in any particular market could\nmaterially impact the valuation of assets as\nreported within our consolidated financial\nstatements. Our ability to hedge exposure is\nin part dependent on our ability to value the\nrelated assets or liabilities.\n\nThe determination of the amount of loss\nallowances and asset impairments varies by\nasset type and is based upon our periodic\nevaluation and assessment of known and\ninherent risks associated with the respective\nasset class. Management updates its\nevaluations regularly and reflects changes in\nallowances and impairments in operations as\nsuch evaluations are revised. Although we have\npolicies and procedures in place to determine\nloss allowance and asset impairments, due to\nthe subjective nature of this area, the level\nof impairments taken and allowances reflected\nin our financial statements may not accurately\nreflect the actual level of risk and the\namount of future losses.\n\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in our business.\n\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure\nrisks and to estimate many financial values.\nWe use models throughout much of our business,\nrelying on them for much of our decision\nmaking. Examples of areas we use models\ninclude determining the pricing of various\nproducts, grading loans and extending credit,\nmeasuring interest rate and other market\nrisks, predicting or estimating losses,\nassessing capital adequacy, and calculating\neconomic and regulatory capital levels. We\nalso use models to estimate the value of\nfinancial instruments and balance sheet items.\nIn particular, we depend significantly on\ncomplex models for credit loss accounting\nunder CECL, many of which have only been in\nuse for a relatively short period of time.\n\nModels generally evaluate the performance of\nvarious factors under anticipated future\nconditions, relying on historical data to help\nbuild the model and in part on assumptions as\nto the future, often with respect to macro-\neconomic conditions, in order to generate the\noutput. Poorly designed or implemented models,\nincluding in the choice of relevant historical\ndata or future-looking assumptions, present\nthe risk that our business decisions based on\ninformation incorporating model output will be\nadversely affected due to the inadequacy of\nthat information. Also, information we provide\nto the public or to our regulators based on\npoorly designed or implemented models could be\ninaccurate or misleading. Some of the\ndecisions that our regulators make, including\nthose related to capital distributions to our\nshareholders, would likely be affected\nadversely if they perceive that the quality of\nthe relevant models used is insufficient.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Our Need for Customers     \n                                              \nOur success depends on our ability to attract\nand retain customers for our products and\nservices.\n\nOur performance is subject to risks associated\nwith declines in customer demand for our\nproducts and services. As a result of the\nnature of those products and services, we are\nparticularly at risk for losses of economic\nconfidence or customer trust in us. For a\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 29\ndiscussion of the risks related to declines in\ndemand for our products and services as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, see the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had\nand is likely to continue to have an adverse\neffect, possibly materially, on our overall\nbusiness and financial performance.\u201d\n\nEconomic and market developments may affect\nconsumer and business confidence levels. If\ncustomers lose confidence due to concerns\nregarding the economy, the demand for our\nproducts and services could suffer. We may\nalso fail to attract or retain customers if we\nare unable to develop and market products and\nservices that meet evolving customer needs or\ndemands or if we are unable to deliver them\neffectively and securely to our customers.\nThis is particularly true to the extent that\nour competitors are better able to do so.\n\nIf we fail to attract and retain customers,\ndemand for our loans and other financial\nproducts and services could decrease and we\ncould experience adverse changes in payment\npatterns. We could lose interest income from a\ndecline in credit usage and noninterest income\nfrom a decline in product sales, investments\nand other transactions.\n\nOur customers could remove money from\nchecking, savings or other types of deposit\naccounts with us in favor of other banks or\nother types of investment products. Deposits\nare a low cost source of funds for us.\nTherefore, losing deposits could increase our\nfunding costs and reduce our net interest\nincome.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customer\ndeposits is impacted by the levels of interest\nrates, as customers balance the benefits of\nbank accounts such as deposit insurance and\nsome of the convenience associated with more\ntraditional banking products against the\npossibility of higher yields from other\ninvestments. In general, if the spread between\nthe rates we offer and those offered by\nalternatives to bank accounts widens,\ncustomers are often willing to forego the\nbenefits of bank accounts for higher returns\nelsewhere. In such circumstances, we would\nneed either to increase rates to levels that\nare seen as competitive or lose customers, in\neither case with a negative impact to net\ninterest income. Loss of customers could also\nharm noninterest income by decreasing fee-\nbearing transaction volume. In addition, when\nrates are higher, customers tend to shift\ndeposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to\ninterest-bearing ones, thereby negatively\nimpacting net interest income.\n\nOur customers increasingly use third party\nfinancial applications that are expected to\ninterface with their PNC accounts. This use\nleads to the risk that issues with respect to\nthe effective functioning of that interface,\nregardless of cause, could result in a loss of\ncustomers as they seek banking relationships\nthat work better with these other\napplications.\n\nNews or other publicity that harms our\nreputation, or harms the reputation of our\nindustry generally, also could cause a loss of\ncustomers or a reduction in the extent to\nwhich customers do business with us. This is\ndescribed further in the Risk Factor headed\n\u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\u201d\n\nIn our asset management business, investment\nperformance is an important factor influencing\nthe level of assets that we manage. Poor\ninvestment advice or performance could hurt\nrevenue and growth as existing clients might\nwithdraw funds in favor of better performing\nproducts. Additionally, the ability to attract\nfunds from existing and new clients might\ndiminish. Overall economic conditions may\nlimit the amount that customers are able or\nwilling to invest as well as the value of the\nassets they do invest. The failure or negative\nperformance of products of other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a loss of\nconfidence in similar products offered by us\nwithout regard to the performance of our\nproducts. Such a negative contagion could lead\nto withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity\nissues in such products and have an adverse\nimpact on our assets under management and\nasset management revenues and earnings.\n\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\n\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract\nand retain customers and employees, and to\ngrow our business is dependent on maintaining\nour reputation and having the trust of our\ncustomers and employees. Many types of\ndevelopments, if publicized, can negatively\nimpact a company\u2019s reputation with adverse\nconsequences to its business.\n\nFinancial services companies are highly\nvulnerable to reputational damage when they\nare found to have harmed customers,\nparticularly retail customers, through conduct\nthat is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive,\nabusive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful.\nThere also may be reputational damage from\nhuman error or systems failures viewed as\nhaving harmed customers but not involving\nmisconduct, including negative perceptions\nregarding our ability to maintain the security\nof our technology systems and protect client\ndata. The reputational impact is likely\ngreater to the extent that the bad conduct,\nerror or failure are pervasive, long-standing\nor affect a significant number of customers,\nparticularly retail consumers. The negative\nimpact of such reputational damage on our\nbusiness may be disproportionate to the actual\nharm caused to customers. It may be severe\neven if we fully remediate any harm suffered\nby our customers. Furthermore, because we\nconduct most of our businesses under the \u201cPNC\u201d\nbrand, negative public opinion about one\nbusiness could also affect our other\nbusinesses. In addition, we could suffer\nreputational harm and a loss of customer trust\nas a result of conduct of others in the\nindustry even where we have not engaged in the\nconduct. We use third parties to help in many\naspects of our business, with the risk that\ntheir conduct can affect our reputation\nregardless of the degree to which we are\nresponsible for it.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nTo an increasing extent, financial services\ncompanies, including PNC, are facing criticism\nfrom social and environmental activists, with\naccompanying reputational risk. Activists\ntarget companies in our industry, including\nPNC, for engaging in business with specific\ncustomers or with customers in particular\nindustries, where the customers\u2019 activities,\neven if legal, are perceived as having harmful\nimpacts on matters such as environment,\nconsumer health and safety, or society at\nlarge. In addition, other activists target\ncompanies in our industry, including PNC,\nseeking increased transparency and action with\nrespect to diversity and inclusion (including\npay equity) and political activities. Activist\ncriticism has come in many forms, including\nprotests at PNC facilities. PNC, together with\nmany other financial services companies, have\nin recent years been criticized for financing\ncompanies engaged in, for example, extraction\nand distribution of fossil fuels, manufacture\nof nuclear and other weapons (including\npersonal firearms), private prisons, and\nborder control activities. Many of these\nissues are divisive without broad agreement as\nto the appropriate steps a company such as PNC\nshould take and often with strong feelings on\nboth sides. As a result, however we respond to\nsuch criticism, we expose ourselves to the\nrisks that current or potential customers\ndecline to do business with us or current or\npotential employees refuse to work for us.\nThis can be true regardless of whether we are\nperceived by some as not having done enough to\naddress activist concerns or by others as\nhaving inappropriately yielded to activist\npressures. Activist pressure can also be a\nfactor in decisions as to which business\nopportunities and customers we pursue,\npotentially resulting in foregone profit\nopportunities. The OCC has requested comment\non a proposed rule that would prohibit large\nnational banks, such as PNC Bank, from\ndeclining to provide credit or other products\nor services to customers engaged in lawful\nactivities except for documented, pre-approved\nrisk-related reasons. The rule, if adopted,\ncould cause some customers to switch their\nbusiness to other banks that are not subject\nto these restrictions or have other negative\nconsequences on PNC\u2019s businesses, operations\nand risk management activities.\n\nThe speed with which information now moves\nthrough social media and non-mainstream news\nsources on the internet means that negative\ninformation about PNC can rapidly have a\nbroadly adverse impact on our reputation. This\nis true whether or not the information is\naccurate. Once information has gone viral, it\ncan be hard to counter it effectively, either\nby correcting inaccuracies or communicating\nremedial steps taken for actual issues. The\npotential impact of negative information going\nviral means that material reputational harm\ncan result from a single discrete or isolated\nincident.\n\nWe are also subject to the risk of\nreputational harm resulting from conduct of\npersons identified as our employees but acting\noutside of the scope of their employment,\nincluding through their activities on personal\nsocial media.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nin terms of the products and services we offer\nand the geographic markets in which we conduct\nbusiness, as well as the labor markets where\nwe compete for talented employees.\n\nWe are subject to intense competition both\nfrom other financial institutions and from\nnon-bank entities, including financial\ntechnology companies (often referred to as\nFinTech). In many cases, non-bank entities can\nengage in many activities similar to ours\nwithout being subject to the same types of\nregulation, supervision and restrictions as\nare applicable to banks. The competition we\nface is described in Item 1 of this Report\nunder \u201cCompetition.\u201d\n\nConsolidation in our industry, including among\nsmaller banks combining to form more\ncompetitive larger ones and between banks and\nnon-bank entities, could result in PNC facing\nmore intense competition, particularly in\nimpacted regions or with respect to particular\nproducts.\n\nAnother increasingly competitive factor in the\nfinancial services industry is the ability to\nattract and retain talented and diverse\nemployees across many of our businesses and\nsupport areas. This factor presents greater\nrisk when we are expanding into new markets,\ndeveloping new product lines, or significantly\nenhancing staffing in certain areas,\nparticularly technology. This competition\nleads to increased expenses in affected\nbusiness areas. In addition, the transition to\nincreased work-from-home, which is likely to\nsurvive the COVID-19 pandemic for many\ncompanies, may exacerbate the challenges of\nattracting and retaining talented and diverse\nemployees as job markets may be less\nconstrained by physical geography. Limitations\non the manner in which regulated financial\ninstitutions can compensate their officers and\nemployees, including those contained in\npending rule proposals implementing\nrequirements of Dodd-Frank, may make it more\ndifficult for regulated financial\ninstitutions, including PNC, to compete with\nunregulated companies for talent.\n\nA failure to adequately address the\ncompetitive pressures we face could make it\nharder for us to attract and retain customers\nacross our businesses. On the other hand,\nmeeting these competitive pressures could\nrequire us to incur significant additional\nexpense or to accept risk beyond what we would\notherwise view as desirable under the\ncircumstances. In addition, in our interest\nrate sensitive businesses, competitive\npressures to increase rates on deposits or\ndecrease rates on loans could reduce our net\ninterest margin, negatively impacting our net\ninterest income.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Other Operational Issues   \n                                              \nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity\nof employees, and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible, to manage\noperational risks.\n\nWe are a large company that offers a wide\nvariety of products and services to a broad\nand diverse group of customers. We rely on our\nemployees to design, manage, and operate our\nsystems and controls to assure that we\nproperly enter into, record and manage\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 31\nprocesses, transactions and other\nrelationships with customers, suppliers and\nother parties with whom we do business. In\nsome cases, we rely on employees of third\nparties to perform these tasks. We also depend\non employees and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible to assure that we\nidentify and mitigate the risks that are\ninherent in our relationships and activities.\nThese concerns are increased when we change\nprocesses or procedures, introduce new\nproducts or services, or implement new\ntechnologies, as we may fail to adequately\nidentify or manage operational risks resulting\nfrom such changes.\n\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on\nemployees, whether ours or those of third\nparties, to perform these tasks and manage\nresulting risks, we are thus subject to human\nvulnerabilities. These range from innocent\nhuman error to misconduct or malfeasance,\npotentially leading to operational breakdowns\nor other failures. Our controls may not be\nadequate to prevent problems resulting from\nhuman involvement in our business, including\nrisks associated with the design, operation\nand monitoring of automated systems. We may\nalso fail to adequately develop a culture of\nrisk management among our employees.\n\nErrors by our employees or others responsible\nfor systems and controls on which we depend\nand any resulting failures of those systems\nand controls could result in significant harm\nto PNC. This could include customer\nremediation costs, regulatory fines or\npenalties, litigation or enforcement actions,\nor limitations on our business activities. We\ncould also suffer damage to our reputation, as\ndescribed under \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse\nimpact on our business due to damage to our\nreputation.\u201d\n\nWe use automation, machine learning,\nartificial intelligence and robotic process\nautomation tools to help reduce some risks of\nhuman error. Nonetheless, we continue to rely\non many manual processes to conduct our\nbusiness and manage our risks. In addition,\nuse of automation tools does not eliminate the\nneed for effective design and monitoring of\ntheir operation to make sure they operate as\nintended. Enhanced use of automation may\npresent its own risks. These tools are\ndependent on the quality of the data used by\nthe tool to learn and enhance the process for\nwhich it is responsible. Not only bad or\nmissing data but also anomalous data can\nadversely affect the functioning of such\ntools. It is possible that humans in some\ncases are better able than highly automated\ntools to identify that anomalous data is being\nused or that results are themselves anomalous.\n\nWe rely on third party vendors, service\nproviders and other counterparties to help\nsupport many aspects of our business. When we\ndo so, our direct control of activities\nrelated to our business is reduced, which\ncould introduce risk.\n\nOur use of third parties to support our\nbusiness needs typically means that we do not\ndirectly control the activities we are having\nthem perform. Risks can arise through greater\ncomplexity and inadequate performance by the\nthird party, specifically where that\nperformance could affect us or our customers.\nMany of the kinds of risks presented by\nactivities performed by third parties are\ndescribed elsewhere in these Risk Factors. For\nexample, we use outside companies to assist us\nin processing some confidential customer or\nemployee information. In such a case, a cyber\nattack on such a company may result in access\nto our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information.\nWe are also vulnerable, including to\nregulatory penalties, where an outside company\nfails to comply with legal requirements\nrelevant to its work on our behalf. We may in\nany such circumstance suffer financial losses,\nlegal consequences and injury to our\nreputation. Even if the other company makes us\nwhole for financial losses, which is not\nnecessarily the case, it is unlikely that it\nwould be able to restore any injury to our\nreputation. As a result, the use of third\nparties to assist in our business activities\nheightens the risks to us inherent in those\nactivities.\n                                              \n  Other Key Risks                             \n                                              \nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse\nresults in legal proceedings.\n\nMany aspects of our business involve\nsubstantial risk of legal liability. We have\nbeen named or threatened to be named as\ndefendants in various lawsuits arising from\nour business activities. In addition, we are\nregularly the subject of governmental\ninvestigations and other forms of regulatory\ninquiry. We also are at risk when we have\nagreed to indemnify others for losses related\nto legal proceedings they face, such as in\nconnection with the sale of a business or\nassets by us. The results of these legal\nproceedings could lead to significant monetary\ndamages or penalties, restrictions on the way\nin which we conduct our business, or\nreputational harm.\n\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal\nproceedings when information related to the\nloss contingencies represented by those\nmatters indicates both that a loss is probable\nand that the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we do not have accruals for all\nlegal proceedings where we face a risk of\nloss. In addition, due to the inherent\nsubjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of the outcome of legal\nproceedings, amounts accrued often do not\nrepresent the ultimate loss to us from the\nlegal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nultimate future losses may be higher, and\npossibly significantly so, than the amounts\naccrued for legal loss contingencies. We\ndiscuss further the unpredictability of legal\nproceedings and describe certain of our\npending legal proceedings in Note 21 Legal\nProceedings in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring\nother financial services businesses from time\nto time. Sometimes these are businesses with\ntechnologies or other assets valuable to us\neven if they do not themselves provide\nfinancial services to customers. These\nacquisitions present a number of risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransactions themselves and to the integration\nof the acquired businesses into PNC after\nclosing.\n\nAcquisitions of other companies or of\nfinancial assets and related deposits and\nother liabilities present risks and\nuncertainties to us in addition to those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired. These risks and uncertainties are\nfound in the pending acquisition of BBVA,\nincluding its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA\nUSA, and its integration into PNC following\nclosing.\n\nAcquisitions may be substantially more\nexpensive or take longer to complete than\nanticipated. This risk includes unanticipated\ncosts incurred in connection with the\nintegration of the acquired business.\nAnticipated benefits (such as cost savings\nfrom synergies or strategic gains from being\nable to offer enhanced product sets) may take\nlonger or require greater resources to\nachieve. In some cases, it may prove\nimpossible to realize them in their entirety.\nThe success of an acquisition generally is at\nleast partially dependent on our ability to\nretain and expand upon the acquired company\u2019s\ncustomer base. It is also frequently subject\nto risks related to human capital, including,\nif being retained, the quality of leadership\nof the acquired company.\n\nSpecific factors that can affect the ultimate\nresults from acquisitions include, depending\non the nature of the business acquired, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition includes loan portfolios,\nthe extent of actual credit losses and the\nrequired allowance for credit losses following\ncompletion of the acquisition.\n\n\u2022 If a significant aspect of the value of an\nacquired business is intellectual property,\nthe extent to which the intellectual property\nmay be protected and commercialized by PNC\nfollowing the acquisition.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition involves entering into\nnew businesses or geographic or other markets,\npotential limitations on our ability to take\nadvantage of these opportunities as a result\nof our inexperience with respect to them.\n\n\u2022 The results of litigation and governmental\ninvestigations that may be pending at the time\nof the acquisition or be filed or commenced\nthereafter, as a result of an acquisition or\notherwise. It is often hard to predict the\nresults of such legal proceedings. It may also\nbe hard to anticipate what legal proceedings\nmay be started following an acquisition based\non the prior activities of the acquired\ncompany (and its predecessors).\n\n\u2022 If the acquired company depends on models\nfor, among other things, capital planning and\ncredit loss accounting, we may have to rely on\nthe acquired company\u2019s models for a period of\ntime post-closing prior to integrating the\nacquired company\u2019s data into PNC\u2019s models. The\nacquired company\u2019s models may be designed or\nimplemented in a manner different than the\nmodels used by PNC. As a result, incorporation\nof the acquired company\u2019s data into our models\ncould materially impact our results of\noperations or financial position to the extent\nthat our estimates based on the acquired\ncompany\u2019s models prove to be inaccurate.\n\n\u2022 The acquired company may operate under\nenterprise risk management systems, policies\nand procedures that are different and less\nmature than those of PNC, and we may need to\nrely on the acquired company\u2019s enterprise risk\nmanagement systems policies and procedures for\na period of time after acquisition, which\nmight limit PNC\u2019s ability to identify,\nmonitor, manage and report risks for a period\nof time.\n\nOur ability to analyze the risks presented by\nprospective acquisitions, as well as our\nability to prepare in advance of closing for\nintegration, depends, in part, on the\ninformation we can gather with respect to the\nbusiness we are acquiring. We may not have\naccess to all of the information that would be\ndesirable. Our pre-acquisition review of the\nbusiness also impacts our ability to prepare\nfor and execute on the integration of an\nacquired business. An acquired company\u2019s\nfinancial and business information and data\nmay not be maintained at the level of detail\nor comprehensiveness to meet all of our post-\nacquisition needs.\n\nProspective acquisition targets are also\nsubject to their own risks that we cannot\nmanage or control prior to closing and that\nmay impact their business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash\nflows. As a result, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash\nflows could be adversely affected after\nclosing to the extent that any such risks\nresult in non-indemnified losses for which we\nare responsible.\n\nCompleting attractive acquisition\nopportunities generally requires various\ngovernmental and regulatory approvals and\nconsents prior to closing. These authorities\nhave broad discretion, and regulatory\napprovals could be delayed, restrictively\nconditioned or denied, including due to\nregulatory issues we (or the target company)\nhave, or may have, under any of the numerous\ngovernmental regulations to which we (or they)\nare subject. Moreover, as a condition to\napproval, governmental authorities may impose\nrequirements, require divestitures or place\nrestrictions on the conduct of the business of\nthe combined company, which could limit the\nbenefits of the acquisition or result in delay\nor the failure to close the acquisition.\nSignificant acquisitions by large banks also\noften attract public scrutiny, which may\nresult in negative publicity that adversely\naffects our reputation. Our ability to make\nlarge acquisitions may be negatively impacted\nas well by changes in leadership at the\nregulatory agencies responsible for reviewing\nor approving the transaction, changes in\nregulatory rules or standards or the\napplication of those rules or standards, or\nfuture regulatory initiatives designed to\nlimit systemic risk and the potential for a\nfinancial institution to become \u201ctoo big to\nfail.\u201d\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 33\nOur business and financial performance could\nbe adversely affected, directly or indirectly,\nby disasters, natural or otherwise, by\nterrorist activities, by international\nhostilities or by domestic civil unrest.\n\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential\nimpact of disasters (whether caused naturally\nor by human conduct), pandemics, terrorist\nactivities, international hostilities and\ndomestic civil unrest can be predicted.\nHowever, these occurrences could adversely\nimpact us, for example, by causing significant\ndamage to our facilities or preventing us from\nconducting our business in the ordinary\ncourse. Also, their impact on our borrowers,\ndepositors, other customers, suppliers or\nother counterparties could result in indirect\nadverse effects on us. Other indirect adverse\nconsequences from disasters, pandemics,\nterrorist activities, international\nhostilities or domestic civil unrest could\nresult from impacts to the financial markets,\nthe economy in general or in any particular\nregion, or key parts of the infrastructure\n(such as the power grid) on which we and our\ncustomers rely. These types of indirect\neffects, whether specific to our\ncounterparties or more generally applicable,\ncould lead, for example, to an increase in\ndelinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that\ncould result in our experiencing higher levels\nof nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and\nprovisions for credit losses. They could also\ncause a reduction in demand for lending or\nother services that we provide. To the extent\nthat climate change increases the frequency or\nseverity of adverse weather conditions, the\nimpact from these types of natural disasters\non us or our customers would be worse.

Our Board of Directors may\nnot pay or set apart dividends on the common\nstock until dividends for all past dividend\nperiods on any series of outstanding preferred\nstock and certain outstanding capital\nsecurities issued by the parent company have\nbeen paid or declared and set apart for\npayment. The Board of Directors presently\nintends to continue the policy of paying\nquarterly cash dividends. The amount of any\nfuture dividends will depend on economic and\nmarket conditions, our financial condition and\noperating results, and other factors,\nincluding contractual restrictions and\napplicable government regulations and policies\n(such as those relating to the ability of bank\nand non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to\nthe parent company and regulatory capital\nlimitations). PNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase\ndividends or otherwise return capital to\nshareholders is subject to PNC\u2019s compliance\nwith its SCB, which is determined at least\nannually through the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR\nprocess as described in the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report.\nThe Federal Reserve also has imposed\nadditional limitations on capital\ndistributions through the first quarter of\n2021 by CCAR participating bank holding\ncompanies (including PNC) and may extend these\nlimitations, potentially in modified form. PNC\nannounced on March 16, 2020 a temporary\nsuspension of our common stock repurchase\nprogram in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve's effort to support the U.S. economy\nduring the pandemic and we continued the\nsuspension through the fourth quarter of 2020,\nwith the exception of employee benefit-related\npurchases in the third quarter. In 2021, our\nplan is to refrain from share repurchases,\nexcluding employee benefit-related purchases,\nduring the period leading up to our pending\nBBVA transaction close date.\n\nFor further information concerning dividend\nrestrictions and other factors that could\nlimit our ability to pay dividends, as well as\nrestrictions on loans, dividends or advances\nfrom bank subsidiaries to the parent company,\nsee the Supervision and Regulation section in\nItem 1, Item 1A Risk Factors, the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section in Item 7, and Note 10\nBorrowed Funds, Note 12 Equity and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report, which we include here by\nreference.\n\n36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nWe include here by reference the information\nregarding our compensation plans under which\nPNC equity securities are authorized for\nissuance as of December 31, 2020 in the table\n(with introductory paragraph and notes) in\nItem 12 of this Report.\n\nOur stock transfer agent and registrar is:\n\nComputershare\n\n462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600\n\nLouisville, KY 40202\n\n800-982-7652\n\nwww.computershare.com/pnc\n\nRegistered shareholders may contact\nComputershare regarding dividends and other\nshareholder services.\n\nWe include here by reference the information\nthat appears under the Common Stock\nPerformance Graph caption at the end of this\nItem 5.\n                                              \n  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities     \n                                              \nNone.\n                                              \n  Equity Security Repurchases                 \n                                              \nDetails of our repurchases of PNC common stock\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 are included\nin the following table:\n                                              \n                                         Ma\u2026  \n                                         nu\u2026  \n                                         of   \n                              To\u2026        sh\u2026  \n                              sh\u2026        th\u2026  \n  In                          pu\u2026        may  \n  t\u2026                          as         yet  \n  e\u2026                          pa\u2026        be   \n  p\u2026                    A\u2026    of         pu\u2026  \n  s\u2026       To\u2026          p\u2026    pu\u2026        un\u2026  \n  d\u2026       sh\u2026          p\u2026    an\u2026        the  \n  2\u2026       pu\u2026          p\u2026    pr\u2026        pr\u2026  \n  p\u2026       (a)          s\u2026    (b)        (b)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  O\u2026                                          \n  1\u00a0    9       $  11\u2026               7\u2026       \n  \u2013\u00a0                                          \n  31                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  1\u00a0                                 7\u2026       \n  \u2013\u00a0                                          \n  30                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  1\u00a0                                 7\u2026       \n  \u2013\u00a0                                          \n  31                                          \n  T\u2026    9       $  11\u2026                        \n                                              \n(a) Includes PNC common stock purchased in\nconnection with our various employee benefit\nplans generally related to forfeitures of\nunvested restricted stock awards and shares\nused to cover employee payroll tax withholding\nrequirements.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of common\nstock repurchases depending on a number of\nfactors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative uses of\ncapital, the potential impact on our credit\nratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy and\ncapital planning processes undertaken by the\nFederal Reserve as part of the CCAR process.\nIn June 2019, we announced share repurchase\nprograms of up to $4.3 billion for the four\nquarter period beginning with the third\nquarter of 2019, in accordance with PNC\u2019s 2019\ncapital plan. In January 2020, we announced an\nincrease to these programs to repurchase up to\nan additional $1.0 billion in common shares\nthrough the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nPNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary\nsuspension of our common stock repurchase\nprogram in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve\u2019s effort to support the U.S. economy\nduring the pandemic. We continued the\nsuspension through the fourth quarter of 2020,\nwith the exception of employee benefit-related\npurchases in the third quarter, consistent\nwith the extension of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nspecial capital distribution restrictions.\nUnder these programs we repurchased 11.0\nmillion shares in 2020 and 25.9 million shares\nin 2019. A maximum amount of 75.1 million\nshares remained available for repurchase under\nthe new stock program authorization at\nDecember 31, 2020.

To provide more meaningful\ncomparisons of net interest margins, we use\nnet interest income on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis in calculating average yields used in\nthe calculation of net interest margin by\nincreasing the interest income earned on tax-\nexempt assets to make it fully equivalent to\ninterest income earned on taxable investments.\nThis adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in\nthe Consolidated Income Statement.

Commercial loan\nnet charge-offs increased $175 million,\nprimarily in industries adversely impacted by\nthe pandemic, and consumer loan net charge-\noffs increased $15 million compared to 2019.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans increased to $5.9\nbillion, or 2.46% of total loans, at December\n31, 2020, calculated under the CECL accounting\nstandard adopted January 1, 2020, compared to\n$3.1 billion, or 1.28% of total loans, at\nDecember 31, 2019. The increase was due to the\ntransition impact from the adoption of the\nCECL standard along with the significantly\nadverse economic impacts of the pandemic and\nits resulting effects on loan portfolio credit\nquality and loan growth.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Item 7.\n                                              \n  Capital Highlights                          \n                                              \nWe maintained a strong capital position during\n2020.\n\n\u2022 The Basel III CET1 capital ratio was 12.2%\nat December 31, 2020 compared with 9.5% at\nDecember 31, 2019.\n\n\u2022 The December 31, 2020 ratio reflects higher\ncapital due in part to the gain from the sale\nof our equity investment in BlackRock and\nchanges under the Tailoring Rules, effective\nJanuary 1, 2020 for PNC, partially offset by\nthe impact of the CECL accounting standard.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, capital benefited from our\nelection of a five-year transition period for\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital is\ndefined as the change in retained earnings at\nadoption plus or minus 25% of the change in\nCECL ACL at the balance sheet date co mpared\nto CECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL\nimpact is added to CET1 capital through\nDecember 31, 2021, then phased-out over the\nfollowing three years.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholder\u2019s equity increased 11% to\n$50.5 billion at December 31, 2020, compared\nto $45.3 billion at December 31, 2019.\n\n\u2022 On January 5, 2021, the PNC board of\ndirectors declared a quarterly cash dividend\non common stock of $1.15 per share payable on\nFebruary 5, 2021.\n\n\u2022 PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary\nsuspension of our common stock repurchase\nprogram in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve\u2019s effort to support the U.S. economy\nduring the pandemic, and continued the\nsuspension through the fourth quarter of 2020,\nconsistent with the extension of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s special capital distribution\nrestrictions. We repurchased $99 million of\ncommon shares in the third quarter to offset\nthe effects of employee benefit plan-related\nissuances in 2020 as permitted by guidance\nfrom the Federal Reserve. In 2021, our plan is\nto refrain from share repurchases, excluding\nemployee benefit-related purchases, during the\nperiod leading up to our pending BBVA\ntransaction close date.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a\nstress capital buffer established by the\nFederal Reserve Board in connection with the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s CCAR process. The\nFederal Reserve also has imposed additional\nlimitations on capital distributions through\nthe first quarter of 2021 by CCAR-\nparticipating bank holding companies and may\nextend these limitations, potentially in\nmodified form.

PNC does not expect real GDP to\nreturn to its pre-pandemic level until late\n2021, and does not expect employment to return\nto its pre-pandemic level until at least 2023.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25%\nthrough at least mid-2024.\n\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nItem 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report\nfor other factors that could cause future\nevents to differ, perhaps materially, from\nthose anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nFor information on financial results for the\nfourth quarter of 2020, see the Selected\nQuarterly Financial Data section in the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) section of\nItem 8 of this Report.\n\nFor the PNC standalone full year 2021,\nexcluding one-time costs related to the BBVA\ntransaction, compared to full year 2020 where\nappropriate, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loan growth to be down in the low-\nsingle digits range, and spot loan growth to\nbe up in the low single-digits range, on a\npercentage basis,\n\n\u2022 Revenue growth to be stable, which includes\nnet interest income down modestly,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to remain stable, and\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n17%.\n\nAssuming a mid-2021 close date and excluding\none-time integration costs, we expect the\npending BBVA acquisition to be approximately\n$600 million accretive to PNC\u2019s 2021 pre-\nprovision net revenue.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2020 where appropriate, we\nexpect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be stable to down modestly,\nwith PPP loans to be up approximately $2\nbillion,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to decline approximately\n1%, which includes the impact of two fewer\ndays in the quarter,\n\n\u25e6 Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest\nincome to decline approximately 3%.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income to decline mid-single\ndigits, on a percentage basis, with other\nnoninterest income to be between $275 million\nand $325 million,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be down in the mid-\nsingle digit range, on a percentage basis, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $200\nmillion and $250 million.\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ONSOLIDATED                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  I                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  NCOME                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  S                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  TATEMENT                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVIEW                                       \n                                              \nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented\nin Item 8 of this Report.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis and Analysis Of Year-To-Year Changes\nIn Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n\nNet interest income decreased $19 million in\n2020 compared with 2019. The decrease was\ndriven by lower yields on interest-earning\nassets, partially offset by lower rates on\ndeposits, higher interest earning asset\nbalances, and lower borrowing rates and\nbalances. Net interest margin decreased 36\nbasis points reflecting the impact of the 1.5%\nreduction in the federal funds rate by the\nFederal Reserve in March 2020 and related\nchanges in other short-term rates.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $3.6\nbillion, or 4%, primarily due to an increase\nin residential mortgage-backed securities.\nAverage investment securities represented 22%\nof average interest-earning assets in 2020,\ncompared to 24% in 2019.\n\nAverage loans grew $17.6 billion, or 8%,\ndriven by commercial and consumer loan growth.\nAverage commercial loans increased by $15.5\nbillion, or 10%, reflecting new production,\nincluding PPP lending under the CARES Act, and\nhigher multifamily agency warehouse lending,\npartially offset by lower average utilization\nof loan commitments.\n\nAverage consumer loans increased $2.1 billion,\nor 3%, to $77.8 billion as growth in\nresidential mortgage, auto, unsecured\ninstallment and credit card loans was\npartially offset by declines in education\nloans due to runoff in the guaranteed\ngovernment loan portfolio and home equity loan\npaydowns and payoffs that exceeded new\norigination volumes.\n\nAverage loans represented 64% of average\ninterest-earning assets in 2020 compared to\n68% in 2019.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits grew $30.5\nbillion as average balances held with the\nFederal Reserve Bank increased due to higher\nliquidity from deposit growth and proceeds\nfrom the sale of our equity investment in\nBlackRock.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits grew $34.2\nbillion, or 17%, as growth in commercial and\nconsumer deposits reflected pandemic-related\naccumulation of customer liquidity.

Refer to Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies and Note 2 Acquisition and\nDivestiture Activity in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for additional details.\n\n(b) Amount as of December 31, 2020 reflects\nthe impact of adopting the CECL accounting\nstandard and our transition from an incurred\nloss methodology for these reserves to an\nexpected credit loss methodology. Prior period\namounts represent ALLL under the incurred loss\nmethodology. Refer to Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 of this Report\nfor additional detail on the adoption of this\nstandard.\n\nOur balance sheet was strong and well-\npositioned at December 31, 2020 and December\n31, 2019.\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased as a result of higher\ninterest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Bank, loan\ngrowth and higher investment securities.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased due to deposit\ngrowth reflecting customer liquidity\naccumulation, partially offset by lower\nborrowed funds, primarily FHLB borrowings,\nfederal funds purchased and bank notes and\nsenior debt.\n\n\u2022 Total equity increased due to higher\nretained earnings driven by the gain on sale\nof our equity investment in BlackRock and\nhigher AOCI, partially offset by dividends on\ncommon and preferred stock, share repurchases,\nthe day-one effect of adopting the CECL\naccounting standard and the redemption of our\nSeries Q preferred stock.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.9 billion\nat December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.9\nbillion since December 31, 2019. The\n\nincrease was attributable to a $0.6 billion\nday-one CECL transition adjustment and a $3.1\nbillion provision for credit losses, partially\n\noffset by net charge-offs of $0.8 billion.

Residential mortgage\nloans increased as the low interest rate\nenvironment resulted in an increase in the\nvolume of originations retained by PNC,\nprimarily of nonconforming loans, which are\nloans that do not meet agency standards as a\nresult of exceeding agency conforming loan\nlimits.\n\nFor information on home equity and residential\nreal estate portfolios, including loans by\ngeography, and our auto loan portfolio, see\nLoan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in\nthe Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section in this Item 7.\n\nFor additional information regarding our loan\nportfolio, see the Credit Risk Management\nportion of the Risk Management section in this\nItem 7 and Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nin our Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n                                              \n  Investment Securities                       \n                                              \nInvestment securities of $88.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 increased $2.0 billion, or\n2%, compared to December 31, 2019, due\nprimarily to net purchases of U.S. Treasury\nand government agency securities, partially\noffset by portfolio run-off of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe level and composition of the investment\nsecurities portfolio fluctuates over time\nbased on many factors including market\nconditions, loan and deposit growth, and\nbalance sheet management activities.

We have included credit ratings\ninformation because we believe that the\ninformation is an indicator of the degree of\ncredit risk to which we are exposed, which\ncould affect our risk-weighted assets and,\ntherefore, our risk-based regulatory capital\nratios under the regulatory capital rules.\nChanges in credit ratings classifications\ncould indicate increased or decreased credit\nrisk and could be accompanied by a reduction\nor increase in the fair value of our\ninvestment securities portfolio. We\ncontinually monitor the credit risk in our\nportfolio and maintain the allowance for\nsecurities at an appropriate level to absorb\nexpected credit losses on our investment\nsecurities portfolio for the remaining\ncontractual term of the securities adjusted\nfor expected prepayments. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies and Note 3 Investment\nSecurities in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report for additional details regarding\nthe methodology for determining the allowance\nand the amount of the allowance for investment\nsecurities, respectively.\n\nThe duration of investment securities was 2.6\nyears at December 31, 2020. We estimate that\nat December 31, 2020 the effective\n\nduration of investment securities was 3.1\nyears for an immediate 50 basis points\nparallel increase in interest rates and 2.0\nyears for an\n\nimmediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in\ninterest rates. Comparable amounts at December\n31, 2019 for the effective duration of\n\ninvestment securities were 2.8 years and 2.4\nyears, respectively.\n\nBased on expected prepayment speeds,

The\ndecrease in earnings was primarily\nattributable to a higher provision for credit\nlosses and lower noninterest income, partially\noffset by higher net interest income.\n\nNet interest income increased primarily due to\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\nloans, as well as growth in average deposits\nand average loan balances, partially offset by\nnarrower interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits.\n\nNoninterest income decreased largely due to\ndeclines in service charges on deposits as a\nresult of fees waived for customers\nexperiencing pandemic-related hardships and\nthe elimination of certain checking product\nfees, as well as a decline in consumer\nservices, including merchant services, and\ncredit and debit card. Lower noninterest\nincome also reflected the impact of negative\nderivative fair value adjustments related to\nVisa Class B common shares of $195 million in\n2020 compared with negative adjustments of\n$100 million in 2019. These declines were\npartially offset by growth in residential\nmortgage revenue attributable to increased\nloan sales revenue as a result of the low\ninterest rate environment and higher revenue\nfrom residential mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation, net of economic hedge.\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nProvision for credit losses increased in 2020\ncompared to 2019 reflecting changes due to the\nadoption of the CECL accounting standard,\ntogether with the significantly adverse\neconomic impacts of the pandemic.\n\nNoninterest expense increased marginally,\nprimarily as a result of higher personnel,\nbranch-related expenses due in part to the\nimpacts of the pandemic, equipment, and\ntechnology costs, partially offset by lower\nadvertising and marketing.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In\n2020, average total deposits increased\ncompared to 2019 primarily driven by growth in\ndemand and savings deposits which benefited\nfrom the impact of government stimulus\npayments and lower consumer spending due to\nthe pandemic. Savings and demand deposits also\nincreased due, in part, to a shift from money\nmarket deposits to relationship-based savings\nproducts.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans grew in\n2020 compared with 2019:\n\n\u2022 Average commercial loans increased primarily\ndue to PPP loans.\n\n\u2022 Average residential real estate loans\nincreased primarily as a result of growth in\nnonconforming residential mortgages and a\nrobust refinance market driven by historically\nlow interest rates.\n\n\u2022 Average auto loan balances in 2020 grew at a\nlower rate than in recent years due to the\nimpacts of the pandemic on auto sales.\n\n\u2022 Average other consumer loans in 2020\nincreased at a lower rate than in 2019 as\ngrowth in the first quarter of 2020 primarily\ndriven by unsecured installment loan\noriginations through digital channels was\nmuted for the remainder of the year as\noriginations declined in part due to effects\nof the pandemic and customer behavior.\n\n\u2022 Average credit card balances increased\nmarginally in 2020 as balance growth in the\nfirst quarter of 2020 was largely offset by\nlower consumer spending for the remainder of\nthe year due to the effects of the pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Average education loans decreased driven by\na decline in the runoff portfolio of\ngovernment guaranteed education loans.\n\n\u2022 Average home equity loans decreased as\npaydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated\nvolume.\n\nIn 2018, we launched our national expansion\nstrategy designed to grow customers with\ndigitally-led banking and a thin branch\nnetwork in markets outside of our existing\nretail branch network and began offering our\ndigital high yield savings deposit product and\nopened our first solution center in Kansas\nCity. Solution centers are an emerging branch\noperating model with a distinctive layout,\nwhere routine transactions are supported\nthrough a combination of technology and\nskilled banker assistance to create\npersonalized customer experiences. The primary\nfocus of the solution center is to bring a\ncommunity element to our digital banking\ncapabilities. The solution center provides a\ncollaborative environment that connects our\ncustomers with our digital solutions and\nservices, beyond deposits and withdrawals.\nFollowing the first solution center opening in\n2018, four additional solution centers opened\nin 2019 with a second in Kansas City and three\nin the Dallas/Fort Worth market. In 2020, we\nexpanded into three new markets, Boston,\nHouston and Nashville and opened seventeen new\nsolution centers. We also offer digital\nunsecured installment and small business loans\nin the expansion markets. Beginning in\nmid-2021, we expect the BBVA acquisition will\naccelerate our Retail National expansion\nefforts to become a coast-to-coast Retail\nBank.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of our\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking and investment products.\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand have closed 162 branches in 2020.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 74% of consumer customers used\nnon-teller channels for the majority of their\ntransactions in 2020 compared with 69% in\n2019, in part reflecting consumer transaction\nbehavior changes during the pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile\nchannels increased to 64% of total deposit\ntransactions in 2020 from 57% in 2019, in part\nreflecting consumer transaction behavior\nchanges during the pandemic.\n\nRetail Banking continues to make progress on\nits multi-year initiative to redesign the home\nlending process, including integrating\nmortgage and home equity lending into a common\nplatform. Technology enhancements supported\nincreased residential mortgage origination\nvolume. In addition, we enhanced the home\nequity origination process to make it easier\nand to reach additional customers by offering\nthe product in new states. The enhanced\nproduct is currently available in forty-three\nstates and we are moving toward offering the\nproduct in most of the remaining states in\n2021. Additional improvements for both\nmortgage and home equity are planned to\ncontinue throughout 2021.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 55\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

Average\nloans for this business increased primarily\ndriven by higher commercial mortgage and\nmultifamily agency warehouse lending,\npartially offset by project loan payoffs.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets-\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business increased primarily driven by\nPPP loan originations, partially offset by\nlower average utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by marketable collateral.\nAverage loans for this business were\nrelatively unchanged as new originations were\nmostly offset by lower average utilization of\nloan commitments.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased in the\ncomparison reflecting customers maintaining\nliquidity due to the economic impacts of the\npandemic. We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nin response to evolving market conditions,\nbank funding needs and client relationship\ndynamics.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking continues to\nexpand its Corporate Banking business, focused\non the middle market and larger sectors. We\nexecuted on our expansion plans into the\nSeattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in\n2021, we expect the BBVA acquisition to\naccelerate our expansion efforts across the\nSouthwest, but this has not changed our\nstrategy regarding our de novo expansion\nefforts.

These locations\ncomplement Corporate & Institutional Banking\nnational businesses with a significant\npresence in these cities, and build on past\nsuccesses in the markets where PNC\u2019s retail\nbanking presence was limited, such as in the\nSoutheast.

On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome, corporate service fees and other\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses.

Treasury management\nrevenue is reported in noninterest income and\nnet interest income. Noninterest income\nincludes treasury management product revenue\nless earnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services. Net interest income\nprimarily includes revenue from all treasury\nmanagement customer deposit balances. Compared\nwith 2019, treasury management revenue\nincreased primarily due to higher deposit\nbalances and product revenue, partially offset\nby narrower interest rate spreads on the value\nof deposits.\n\nCapital markets-related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives,\nsecurities underwriting, loan syndications,\nmergers and acquisitions advisory and equity\ncapital markets advisory related services. The\nincrease in capital markets-related revenue in\nthe comparison was broad-based across most\nproducts and services and included higher\ncredit valuations and fees on customer-related\nderivatives activities, underwriting fees,\nequity capital market advisory fees and asset-\nbacked financing fees.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income) and revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nrelated hedges.

provision for\ncredit losses, partially offset by a decrease\nin noninterest expense.\n\nNet interest income increased due to growth in\naverage loan and deposit balances and wider\ninterest rate spreads on loans, partially\noffset by narrower interest rate spreads on\nthe value of deposits.\n\nNoninterest income decreased due to lower\nasset management fees resulting from the\nimpact of 2019 divestiture activities and the\ngains recognized on the retirement\nrecordkeeping and the PNC Capital Advisors\ninvestment management business divestitures in\nthe prior period. This decline was partially\noffset by increases in the average equity\nmarkets.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased in the\ncomparison and was primarily attributable to\nthe impact of the 2019 divestitures and lower\nvariable costs.\n\nProvision for credit losses increased\nreflecting changes due to the adoption of the\nCECL accounting standard, together with the\nsignificantly adverse economic impacts of the\npandemic.\n\nAsset Management Group\u2019s discretionary client\nassets under management increased in\ncomparison to the prior year primarily\nattributable to higher equity markets as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nThe Asset Management Group strives to be the\nleading relationship-based provider of\ninvestment, planning, banking and fiduciary\nservices to wealthy individuals and\ninstitutions by proactively delivering value-\nadded ideas, solutions and exceptional\nservice.\n\nWealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100\noffices operating in six out of the ten most\naffluent states in the U.S. with a majority\nco-located with retail banking branches.

Accordingly, we\ndesign our risk governance framework, referred\nto as the (ERM) Framework, and risk management\nprocesses to help manage this risk. We manage\nrisk in light of our risk appetite to optimize\nlong-term shareholder value while supporting\nour employees, customers and communities.\n\nOur ERM Framework is structurally aligned with\nenhanced prudential standards and heightened\nstandards which establish minimum requirements\nfor the design and implementation of a risk\ngovernance framework. This Risk Management\nsection describes our ERM Framework which\nconsists of seven core components that provide\nexecutive management and the Board of\nDirectors with an aggregate view of\nsignificant risks impacting the organization.\nThe seven core components are risk culture,\nenterprise strategy (including risk appetite,\nstrategic planning, capital planning and\nstress testing), risk governance and\noversight, risk identification, risk\nassessments, risk controls and monitoring, and\nrisk aggregation and reporting (see the figure\nbelow). The overall Risk Management section of\nthis Item 7 also provides an analysis of the\nfirm\u2019s Capital Management and our key areas of\nrisk, which include but are not limited to\nCredit, Market, Liquidity and Operational\n(including Compliance and Information\nSecurity). Our use of financial derivatives as\npart of our overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process is also addressed within\nthis Risk Management section.\n\nWe operate within a rapidly evolving\nregulatory environment. Accordingly, we are\nactively focused on the timely adoption of\napplicable regulatory pronouncements within\nour ERM Framework.\n\n60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Risk Culture                                \n                                              \nA strong risk culture helps us make well-\ninformed decisions, ensures individuals\nconform to the established culture, reduces an\nindividual\u2019s ability to do something for\npersonal gain, and rewards employees working\ntoward a common goal rather than individual\ninterests. Our risk culture reinforces the\nappropriate protocols for responsible and\nethical behavior. These protocols are\nespecially critical in terms of our risk\nawareness, risk-taking behavior and risk\nmanagement practices.\n\nManaging risk is every employee\u2019s\nresponsibility. All of our employees\nindividually and collectively are responsible\nfor ensuring the organization is performing\nwith the utmost integrity, is applying sound\nrisk management practices and is striving to\nachieve our stated objectives rather than\npursuing individual interests. All employees\nare also responsible for understanding our\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM\nFramework and how risk management applies to\ntheir respective roles and responsibilities.\nEmployees are encouraged to collaborate across\ngroups to identify and mitigate risks and\nelevate issues as required. We reinforce risk\nmanagement responsibilities through a\nperformance management system where employee\nperformance goals include risk management\nobjectives and incentives for employees to\nreinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted\nperformance.\n\nProactive and open communication, between\ngroups and up to the Board of Directors,\nfacilitates timely identification and\nresolution of risk issues. Our multi-level\nrisk committee structure provides formal\nchannels to identify and report risk.\n                                              \n  Enterprise Strategy                         \n                                              \nWe ensure that our overall enterprise strategy\nis within acceptable risk parameters through\nour risk appetite, strategic planning, capital\nplanning and stress testing processes. These\ncomponents are reviewed and approved at least\nannually by the Board of Directors.\n\nRisk Appetite : Our risk appetite represents\nthe organization\u2019s desired enterprise risk\nposition, set within our capital based risk\nand liquidity capacity to achieve our\nstrategic objectives and business plans. The\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement\nqualitatively describes the aggregate level of\nrisk we are willing to accept in order to\nexecute our business strategies. Qualitative\nguiding principles further define each of the\nrisks within our taxonomy to support the risk\nappetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and\nlimits, including forward-looking metrics,\nquantitatively measure whether we are\noperating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our\nrisk appetite metrics reflect material risks,\nalign with our established Risk Appetite\nFramework, balance risk and reward, leverage\nanalytics, and adjust in a timely manner to\nchanges in the external and internal risk\nenvironments.\n\nStrategic Planning : Our enterprise and line\nof business strategic plans outline major\nobjectives, strategies and goals which are\nexpected to be achieved over the next five\nyears while seeking to ensure we remain\ncompliant with all capital, risk appetite and\nliquidity targets and guidelines. Our CEO and\nCFO lead the development of the corporate\nstrategic plan, the strategic objectives and\nthe comprehensive identification of material\nrisks that could hinder successful\nimplementation and execution of strategies.\nStrategic planning is linked to our risk\nmanagement and capital planning processes.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing : Capital\nplanning helps to ensure we are maintaining\nsafe and sound operations and viability. The\ncapital planning process and the resulting\ncapital plan evolve as our overall risks,\nactivities and risk management practices\nchange. Capital planning aligns with our\nstrategic planning process. Stress testing is\nan essential element of the capital planning\nprocess. Effective stress testing enables us\nto consider the estimated effect on capital of\nvarious hypothetical scenarios.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 61\n                                              \n  Risk Governance and Oversight               \n                                              \nWe employ a comprehensive risk management\ngovernance framework to help ensure that risks\nare identified, balanced decisions are made\nthat consider risk and return, and risks are\nadequately monitored and managed. Risk\ncommittees established within this risk\ngovernance and oversight framework provide\noversight for risk management activities at\nthe Board of Directors, executive, corporate\nand business levels. Committee composition is\ndesigned to provide effective oversight\nbalanced across the three lines of defense in\naccordance with the OCC\u2019s Heightened Risk\nManagement and Governance Standards and\nGuidelines and the Federal Reserve Board's\nEnhanced Prudential Standards rules. See the\nSupervision and Regulation section in Item 1\nof this Report for more information.\n\nTo ensure the appropriate risks are being\ntaken and effectively managed and controlled,\nrisk is managed across three lines of defense.\nThe Board of Directors\u2019 and each line of\ndefense\u2019s responsibilities are detailed below:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 The Board of Directors\noversees our risk-taking activities, holds\nmanagement accountable for adhering to the ERM\nFramework and is responsible for exercising\nsound, independent judgment when assessing\nrisk.\n\nFirst line of defense \u2013 The front line units\nare accountable for identifying, owning and\nmanaging risks to within acceptable levels\nwhile adhering to the ERM Framework. Our\nbusinesses strive to enhance risk management\nand internal control processes within their\nareas. Integrated and comprehensive processes\nare designed to adequately manage the\nbusiness\u2019 risk profile and risk appetite\nthrough identifying, assessing, monitoring and\nreporting risks which may significantly impact\neach business.\n\nSecond line of defense \u2013 The second line of\ndefense is independent from the first line of\ndefense and is responsible for establishing\nthe risk governance framework and the\nstandards by each independent risk area for\nidentifying, measuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting aggregate risks. As\nthe second line of defense, the independent\nrisk areas monitor the risks generated by the\nfirst line of defense, review and challenge\nthe implementation of effective risk\nmanagement practices, and report any issues or\nexceptions. The risk areas help to ensure\nprocesses and controls owned by the businesses\nare designed and operating as intended, and\nthey may intervene directly in modifying and\ndeveloping first line of defense risk\nprocesses and controls .\n\nThird line of defense \u2013 As the third line of\ndefense, Internal Audit is independent from\nthe first and second lines of defense.\nInternal Audit provides the Board of Directors\nand executive management comprehensive\nassurance on the effectiveness of the ERM\nFramework and the risk management practices\nacross the organization.\n\nWithin the three lines of defense, the\nindependent risk organization has sufficient\nauthority to influence material decisions. Our\nbusiness oversight and decision-making is\nsupported through a governance structure at\nthe Board of Directors and management level.\nSpecific responsibilities include:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 Our Board of Directors\noversees our business and affairs as managed\nby our officers and employees. The Board of\nDirectors may receive assistance in carrying\nout its duties and may delegate authority\nthrough the following standing committees:\n\n\u2022 Audit Committee : monitors the integrity of\nour consolidated financial statements;\nmonitors internal control over financial\nreporting; monitors compliance with our code\nof ethics; evaluates and monitors the\nqualifications and independence of our\nindependent auditors; and evaluates and\nmonitors the performance of our Internal Audit\nfunction and our independent auditors.\n\n\u2022 Nominating and Governance Committee :\noversees the implementation of sound corporate\ngovernance principles and practices while\npromoting our best interests and those of our\nshareholders.\n\n\u2022 Personnel and Compensation Committee :\noversees the compensation of our executive\nofficers and other specified responsibilities\nrelated to personnel and compensation matters\naffecting us. The committee is also\nresponsible for evaluating the relationship\nbetween risk-taking activities and incentive\ncompensation plans.\n\n\u2022 Risk Committee : oversees enterprise-wide\nrisk structure and the processes established\nto identify, measure, monitor and manage the\norganization\u2019s risks and evaluates and\napproves our risk governance framework. The\nRisk Committee has formed a Technology\nSubcommittee and a Compliance Subcommittee to\nfacilitate Board-level oversight of risk\nmanagement in these areas.\n\nIn 2020, the Board created the Special\nCommittee on Equity & Inclusion, which assists\nthe Board in its oversight of management\u2019s\nequity and inclusion efforts, internally and\nexternally, focusing on our systemic processes\n(including for employees and suppliers); low\nand moderate income communities (including\ncommunity development banking, and product\nofferings and financial support for such\ncommunities); and advocacy (including\npartnerships with leading organizations, and\nadvocacy for necessary structural changes to\nhelp provide greater access to the banking\nsystem and end systemic racism).\n\nManagement Level Executive Committee \u2013 The\nManagement Level Executive Committee is\nresponsible for guiding the creation and\nexecution of our business strategy across the\ncompany. With this responsibility, the\nManagement Level Executive Committee executes\nvarious strategic approval and review\nactivities, with a focus on capital\ndeployment, business performance and risk\nmanagement. This Committee also helps ensure\nPNC is staffed with sufficient resources and\ntalent to operate within its risk appetite.\n\n62 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nCorporate Committees \u2013 The Corporate\nCommittees generally operate based on the\ndelegated approval authority from a Board-\nlevel Committee, the Management Level\nExecutive Committee or other Corporate\nCommittees. These Committees operate at the\nsenior management level and are designed to\nfacilitate the review, evaluation, oversight\nand approval of key risk activities.\n\nWorking Committees \u2013 The Working Committees\ngenerally operate on delegated approval\nauthority from a Corporate Committee, other\nWorking Committees or provide oversight of\nregulatory/legal matters. Working Committees\nare intended to assist in the implementation\nof key enterprise-level activities within a\nbusiness or function and support the oversight\nof the businesses key risk activities.\n\nTransactional Committees \u2013 Transactional\nCommittees generally operate based on\ndelegated approval authority from a Corporate\nor Working Committee to approve individual\ntransactions, transactional related activities\nor movements on the organization's balance\nsheet.\n\nPolicies and Procedures \u2013 We have established\nrisk management Policies and Procedures to\nsupport our ERM Framework, articulate our risk\nculture, define the parameters and processes\nwithin which employees are to manage risk and\nconduct our business activities and to provide\ndirection, guidance and clarity on roles and\nresponsibilities to management and the Board\nof Directors. These Policies and Procedures\nare organized in a multi-tiered framework and\nrequire periodic review and approval by\nrelevant Committees or management.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nRisk identification takes place across a\nvariety of risk types throughout the\norganization. These risk types include, but\nare not limited to, credit, liquidity and\ncapital, market, operational and compliance.\nRisks are identified based on a balanced use\nof analytical tools and management judgment\nfor both on- and off-balance sheet exposures.\nOur governance structure supports risk\nidentification by facilitating assessment of\nkey risk issues, emerging risks and\nidiosyncratic risks and implementation of\nmitigation strategies as appropriate. These\nrisks are prioritized based on quantitative\nand qualitative analysis and assessed against\nthe risk appetite. Multiple tools and\napproaches are used to help identify and\nprioritize risks, including Risk Appetite\nMetrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance\nIndicators, Risk Control and Self-Assessments,\nscenario analysis, stress testing and special\ninvestigations.\n\nRisks are aggregated and assessed within and\nacross risk functions or businesses. The\naggregated risk information is reviewed and\nreported at an enterprise level for adherence\nto the Risk Appetite Framework and approved by\nthe Board of Directors or by appropriate\ncommittees. This enterprise aggregation and\nreporting approach promotes the identification\nand appropriate escalation of material risks\nacross the organization and supports an\nunderstanding of the cumulative impact of risk\nin relation to our risk appetite.\n                                              \n  Risk Assessment                             \n                                              \nOnce risks are identified, they are evaluated\nbased on quantitative and qualitative analysis\nto determine whether they are material. Risk\nassessments support the overall management of\nan effective ERM Framework and allow us to\ncontrol and monitor our actual risk level and\nrisk management effectiveness through the use\nof risk measures. Comprehensive, accurate and\ntimely assessments of risk are essential to an\neffective ERM Framework. Effective risk\nmeasurement practices will uncover recurring\nrisks that have been experienced in the past;\nmake the known risks easy to monitor,\nunderstand, compare and report; and reveal\nunanticipated risks that may not be easy to\nunderstand or predict.\n                                              \n   Risk Controls and Monitoring               \n                                              \nOur ERM Framework consists of policies,\nprocesses, personnel and control systems. Risk\ncontrols and limits provide the linkage from\nour Risk Appetite Statement and associated\nguiding principles to the risk-taking\nactivities of our businesses. In addition to\nrisk appetite limits, a system of more\ndetailed internal controls exists which\noversees and monitors our various processes\nand functions. These control systems measure\nperformance, help employees make correct\ndecisions, help ensure information is accurate\nand reliable and document compliance with laws\nand regulations.\n\nWe design our monitoring and evaluation of\nrisks and controls to provide assurance that\npolicies, procedures and controls are\neffective and also to result in the\nidentification of control improvement\nrecommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily,\nongoing process used by both the first and\nsecond line of defense to ensure compliance\nwith our ERM Framework. Risk monitoring is\naccomplished in many ways, including\nperforming risk assessments at the prime\nprocess and risk assessment unit level,\nmonitoring an area\u2019s key controls, the timely\nreporting of issues, and establishing a\nquality control and/or quality assurance\nfunction, as applicable.\n                                              \n  Risk Aggregation and Reporting              \n                                              \nRisk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i)\naggregate risks; (ii) identify concentrations;\n(iii) help ensure we remain within our\nestablished risk appetite; (iv) serve as a\nbasis for monitoring our risk profile in\nrelation to our risk appetite and (v)\ncommunicate risks to the Board of Directors\nand executive management.\n\nRisk reports are produced at the line of\nbusiness, functional risk and enterprise\nlevels. The enterprise level risk report\naggregates risks identified in the risk area\nreports and in the business reports to define\nthe enterprise risk profile. The enterprise\nrisk profile is a point-in-time assessment of\nenterprise risk and represents our overall\nrisk position in relation to the desired\nenterprise risk appetite.

The enterprise\nlevel report is provided through the\ngovernance structure to the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nEach individual risk report includes an\nassessment of inherent risk, quality of risk\nmanagement, residual risk, risk appetite and\nrisk outlook. The enterprise level risk report\nincludes an aggregate view of risks identified\nin the individual report and provides a\nsummary of our overall risk profile compared\nto our risk appetite.\n                                              \n   Credit Risk Management                     \n                                              \nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with contractual terms.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business and results from extending\ncredit to customers, purchasing securities,\nand entering into financial derivative\ntransactions and certain guarantee contracts.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant\nrisks. Our processes for managing credit risk\nare designed to be embedded in our risk\nculture and in our decision-making processes\nusing a systematic approach whereby credit\nrisks and related exposures are identified and\nassessed, managed through specific policies\nand processes, measured and evaluated against\nour risk appetite and credit concentration\nlimits, and reported, along with specific\nmitigation activities, to management and the\nBoard of Directors through our governance\nstructure.

The following provides additional\ninformation about the significant loan classes\nthat comprise our Commercial and Consumer\nportfolio segments.\n\nCommercial\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are\nincorporated into the transaction and\nportfolio management policies and procedures\nthat govern our underwriting and portfolio\nmanagement practices. All Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking transactions are subject\nto an Environmental and Social Risk Management\nassessment designed to help us better identify\nand mitigate environmental, human rights and\nother social risks early in the credit\napplication process. Transactions identified\nas having a potential environmental, human\nrights or other social risk are evaluated to\ndetermine whether enhanced due diligence is\nwarranted. We have also chosen to limit new\noriginations in sectors that are no longer\nconsistent with our strategic direction, such\nas mountain-top removal coal mining and\nprivate prisons. We periodically review\nenvironmental and social risk topics in PNC\u2019s\nCredit Portfolio Strategy Committee, and\noutcomes of these reviews may result in\nchanges to our due diligence, origination\nrequirements, or limits on credit exposure.\nOur approach to identifying environmental and\nsocial risks is regularly reviewed by senior\nmanagement and overseen by our Board of\nDirectors. PNC will continue to refine its\napproach as banking conditions, regulatory\nrequirements, investors\u2019 perspectives and our\nstrategic direction evolve.\n\n64 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nC ommercial and Industrial\n\nCommercial and industrial loans comprised 55%\nand 52% of our total loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The\nmajority of our commercial and industrial\nloans are secured by collateral that provides\na secondary source of repayment for the loan\nshould the borrower experience cash generation\ndifficulties. Examples of this collateral\ninclude short-term assets, such as accounts\nreceivable, inventory and securities, and\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment, real\nestate and other business assets.\n\nWe actively manage our commercial and\nindustrial loans to assess any changes (both\npositive and negative) in the level of credit\nrisk at both the borrower and portfolio level.\nTo evaluate the level of credit risk, we\nassign internal risk ratings reflecting our\nestimates of the borrower\u2019s PD and LGD for\neach related credit facility. This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geography that may exist in our portfolio.\nOur commercial and industrial portfolio is\nwell-diversified as shown in the following\ntable which provides a breakout by industry\nclassification (classified based on the\nNAICS).\n\nTable 15: Commercial and Industrial Loans by\nIndustry\n                                              \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  20\u2026     16  %    $  21\u2026     17  %  \n  R\u2026       20\u2026     15          21\u2026     17     \n  t\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       19\u2026     15          16\u2026     13     \n  p\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026       14\u2026     11          11\u2026      9     \n  s\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026       13\u2026     10          12\u2026     10     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       8,\u2026      7          8,\u2026      6     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       7,\u2026      5          7,\u2026      6     \n  w\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       27\u2026     21          26\u2026     22     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $  13\u2026    100  %    $  12\u2026    100  %  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real\nestate and construction industries.\n\nCommercial and industrial loan growth at\nDecember 31, 2020 primarily reflects the\nimpact of PPP lending under the CARES Act and\nhigher multifamily agency warehouse lending,\npartially offset by lower utilization of loan\ncommitments.

We continue\nto carefully monitor and manage these loans,\nand while we have not yet experienced material\ncharge-offs in these industries, we do expect\nto see further stress.\n\nIn our non-real estate related category we\nhave $9.7 billion in loans outstanding, $1.9\nbillion of which are funded through the PPP\nand guaranteed by the SBA under the CARES Act.\nNonperforming loans in these industries\ntotaled $0.1 billion, or 1% of total loans\noutstanding in the non-real estate related\ncategory, while criticized assets totaled $1.3\nbillion at December 31, 2020 with the greatest\nstress seen in the leisure recreation and\nleisure travel sectors.\n\nWithin the real estate related category we\nhave $7.5 billion in loans outstanding, which\nincludes real estate projects of $5.0 billion\nand unsecured real estate of $2.5 billion.\nNonperforming loans in this category totaled\n$0.2 billion at December 31, 2020, or 3% of\ntotal\n\n66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nloans outstanding in the commercial real\nestate related category, driven primarily by\nloans related to two real estate investment\ntrusts. In this category, we continue to see\nsubstantial stress in the non-essential retail\nand hotel segments.\n\nOil and Gas Loan Portfolio\n\nWe are also monitoring our oil and gas\nportfolio closely for elevated levels of\ncredit risk given the continued pressures on\nthe energy industry. As of December 31, 2020,\nour outstanding loans in the oil and gas\nsector totaled $3.4 billion, or 1% of total\nloans, which included $0.1 billion funded\nthrough the PPP and guaranteed by the SBA\nunder the CARES Act. This portfolio comprised\napproximately $1.6 billion in the midstream\nand downstream sectors, $0.9 billion of oil\nservices companies and $0.9 billion related to\nexploration and production companies. Of the\noil services category, approximately $0.2\nbillion is not asset-based or investment\ngrade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas\nsector as of December 31, 2020 totaled $0.2\nbillion, or 6% of total loans outstanding in\nthis sector. Additional unfunded loan\ncommitments for the oil and gas portfolio\ntotaled $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\nConsumer\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $12.6 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $11.5 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at December 31, 2020.\nComparable amounts were $13.9 billion and\n$11.2 billion, as of December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance monthly,\nincluding obtaining original LTVs, updated\nFICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs\nat least quarterly, and other credit metrics\nat least quarterly, including the historical\nperformance of any related mortgage loans\nregardless of whether we hold the lien. We\nalso segment the population into pools based\non product type ( e.g. , home equity loans,\nbrokered home equity loans, home equity lines\nof credit, brokered home equity lines of\ncredit). This information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit quality of newly originated loans\nin 2020 was strong overall with a weighted-\naverage LTV on originations of 67% and a\nweighted-average FICO score of 776.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes.

economic impacts of the pandemic and\nits resulting effects on loan portfolio credit\nquality and loan growth.\n\nThe increase in nonperforming assets at\nDecember 31, 2020 was primarily attributable\nto higher nonperforming commercial loans in\nindustries adversely impacted by the pandemic\nand the energy industry and an increase in\nresidential real estate nonperforming loans\nprimarily related to borrowers exiting\nforbearance and deferring payments to the end\nof the loan term, partially offset by the\ndecline in OREO and foreclosed assets due to\nasset sales and the suspension of pandemic-\nrelated foreclosures.

As of\nDecember 31, 2020, commercial nonperforming\nloans were carried at approximately 83% of\ntheir unpaid principal balance, due to charge-\noffs and interest applied to principal, before\nconsideration of the ALLL.\n\nWithin consumer nonperforming loans,\nresidential real estate TDRs comprised 47% of\ntotal residential real estate nonperforming\nloans, while home equity TDRs comprised 41% of\nhome equity nonperforming loans at December\n31, 2020. Comparable amounts at December 31,\n2019 were 79% and 49%, respectively. TDRs\ngenerally remain in nonperforming status until\na borrower has made at least six consecutive\nmonths of both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms or ultimate\nresolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus and loans to borrowers not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Loans that have\nbeen restructured for COVID-19 related\nhardships and meet certain criteria under the\nCARES Act are not identified as TDRs. Refer to\nthe Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications discussion in this Credit Risk\nManagement section for more information on the\ntreatment of loan modifications under the\nCARES Act.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, our largest\nnonperforming asset was $141 million in the\nReal Estate and Rental and Leasing industry\nand the ten largest individual nonperforming\nassets represented 19% of total nonperforming\nassets.\n\nLoan Delinquencies\n\nWe regularly monitor the level of loan\ndelinquencies and believe these levels may be\na key indicator of credit quality in our loan\nportfolio. Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans and loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option, and at December\n31, 2020 also include PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale, while amounts as\nof December 31, 2019 also excluded purchased\nimpaired loans.\n\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in\nApril 2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the\nDecember 31, 2020 delinquency status of loans\nmodified due to COVID-19 related hardships\naligns with the rules set forth for banks to\nreport delinquency status to the credit\nagencies. These rules require that COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications be reported as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of December 31, 2020\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period. Loan modifications due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships that permanently\nreduce either the contractual interest rate or\nthe principal balance of a loan do not qualify\nfor TDR relief under the CARES Act or the\ninteragency guidance.

TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions ( e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that have been\nrestructured but that meet certain criteria\nunder the CARES Act are not categorized as\nTDRs.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\nTroubled Debt Restructurings at December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively:\n\nTable 23: Summary of Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (a)\n                                              \n              D\u2026           D\u2026                 \n              31           31                 \n              2\u2026           2\u2026       C\u2026        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $            %                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5\u2026        $  3\u2026        $  1\u2026    4\u2026  \n  \u2026       1\u2026           1\u2026           -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  1\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  9\u2026        $  8\u2026        $  59    7%  \n  \u2026       7\u2026           8\u2026           -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  1\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table do not include associated\nvaluation allowances.\n\n(b) Accruing loans include consumer credit\ncard loans and certain loans that have\ndemonstrated a period of at least six months\nof performance under the restructured terms\nand are excluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nNonperforming TDRs represented approximately\n39% of total nonperforming loans and 55% of\ntotal TDRs at December 31, 2020.

Loan\nmodifications related to COVID-19 hardships\nthat permanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate and/or principal balance of the\nloan are designated as TDRs. For additional\ninformation on the CARES Act and interagency\nguidance, see the COVID-19 Relief section\nwithin Item 1 of this Report.\n\nThe impact of these modifications was\nconsidered within the quarterly reserve\ndetermination.

Modifications made were in the form of\nprincipal and/or interest (payment) deferrals,\ncovenant waivers and other types of\nmodifications, including term extensions, and\nwere based on each individual borrower\u2019s\nsituation.\n\nCommercial accounts in active assistance under\nCOVID-19 hardship relief payment deferral\nprograms totaled $0.1 billion, or 0.1% of\ntotal commercial loans at December 31, 2020.\n\nWe are monitoring the delinquency status of\nloans exiting assistance as a measure to\nassess credit risk.

Loan\nmodifications that permanently reduce either\nthe contractual interest rate and/or principal\nbalance of the loan would not meet the\nqualifications for relief from TDR treatment\nunder the CARES Act.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nOn January 1, 2020 we adopted the CECL\nstandard which replaced the incurred loss\nmethodology for our credit related reserves\nwith an expected credit loss methodology for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term of\nin-scope assets and off-balance sheet\nexposures. Our ACL is based on historical loss\nexperience, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, equipment finance leases,\ntrade receivables and other financial assets\nand off-balance sheet credit exposures and\ndetermine this allowance based on quarterly\nassessments of the remaining estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures as\nof the balance sheet date.\n\nExpected losses are estimated using a\ncombination of (i) the expected losses over a\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\n(ii) a period of reversion to long run average\nexpected losses where applicable and (iii)\nlong run average expected losses for the\nremaining estimated contractual term.\n\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we have established a\nframework which includes a three year forecast\nperiod and the use of four economic scenarios\nand associated probability weights, which in\ncombination create a forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes over the forecasted period.\nForward looking information, such as\nforecasted relevant macroeconomic variables,\nis incorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates using quantitative techniques, as\nwell as through analysis from PNC\u2019s economists\nand management\u2019s judgment in qualitatively\nassessing the ACL.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long run average expected\ncredit losses. We may consider a number of\nfactors in determining the duration of the\nreversion period, such as contractual maturity\nof the asset, observed historical patterns and\nthe estimated credit loss rates at the end of\nthe forecast period relative to the beginning\nof the long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long run average expected credit losses\nare derived from our available historical\ncredit information. We use long run average\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 73\nexpected loss for the portfolio over the\nestimated remaining contractual term beyond\nour forecast period and the reversion period.\n\nThe following discussion provides additional\ninformation related to our reserves under CECL\nfor loans and leases as well as unfunded\nlending related commitments. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for further discussion on our ACL,\nincluding details of our methodologies and\ndiscussion of the allowances for investment\nsecurities and other financial assets. See\nalso the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section for further discussion of\nthe assumptions used in the determination of\nthe ACL.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD and\nthe remaining estimated contractual term for a\nloan or loan segment. We also consider the\nimpact of prepayments and amortization on\ncontractual maturity in our expected loss\nestimates. We use historical data, current\nborrower characteristics and forecasted\neconomic variables in quantitative methods to\nestimate these risk parameters by loan or loan\nsegments. PDs represent a quantification of\nrisk that a borrower may not be able to pay\ntheir contractual obligation over a defined\nperiod of time. LGD describes the estimate of\npotential loss if a borrower were to default,\nand EAD (or utilization rates for revolving\nloans) is the estimated balance outstanding at\nthe time of default and expected loss. These\nparameters are calculated for each forecasted\nscenario, and are combined to generate\nexpected loss estimates by scenario in\nproportion to the scenario weights.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology for\nour consumer real estate related loan classes\nand for certain commercial and consumer TDR\nloans. For non-TDR residential real estate\nloans and lines, we determine effective\ninterest rates considering contractual cash\nflows adjusted for prepayments and market\ninterest rates. We then determine the net\npresent value of expected cash flows and ALLL\nby discounting contractual cash flows adjusted\nfor both prepayments and expected credit\nlosses using the effective interest rates.\n\nWe establish individually assessed reserves\nfor loans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans\nusing methods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for\nindividual commercial nonperforming loans and\ncommercial TDRs exceeding a defined dollar\nthreshold are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Commercial\nloans that are below the defined threshold and\naccruing TDRs are collectively reserved for,\nas we believe these loans continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. For consumer\nnonperforming loans classified as collateral\ndependent, charge-off and ALLL related to\nrecovery of amounts previously charged-off are\nevaluated through an analysis of the fair\nvalue of the collateral less costs to sell.\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses attributable to such risks. A\nportion of the allowance is related to\nqualitative measurement factors. These factors\nmay include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\nincluding the impacts of COVID-19 on highly\nimpacted segments,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends, including the\nimpact of COVID-19 hardship related loan\nmodifications,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macro-economic factors that may not\nbe reflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information, including\nthe performance of first lien positions.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable, ( e.g., unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees) at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. The allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments is recorded as a\nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNet adjustments to this reserve are included\nin the provision for credit losses.\n\n74 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table summarizes our allowance\nfor credit loss by loan class:\n\nTable 25: Allowance for Credit Losses by

The second is the potential\ninability to operate our businesses because\nadequate contingent liquidity is not\navailable. We manage liquidity risk at the\nconsolidated company level (bank, parent\ncompany and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to\nhelp ensure that we can obtain cost-effective\nfunding to meet current and future obligations\nunder both normal \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and\nstressful circumstances, and to help ensure\nthat we maintain an appropriate level of\ncontingent liquidity.\n\nManagement monitors liquidity through a series\nof early warning indicators that may indicate\na potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity\nstress event. In addition, management performs\na set of liquidity stress tests over multiple\ntime horizons with varying levels of severity\nand maintains a contingency funding plan to\naddress a potential liquidity stress event. In\nthe most severe liquidity stress simulation,\nwe assume that our liquidity position is under\npressure, while the market in general is under\nsystemic pressure. The simulation considers,\namong other things, the impact of restricted\naccess to both secured and unsecured external\nsources of funding, accelerated runoff of\ncustomer deposits, valuation pressure on\nassets and heavy demand to fund committed\nobligations. Parent company liquidity\nguidelines are designed to help ensure that\nsufficient liquidity is available to meet our\nparent company obligations over the succeeding\n24-month period. Liquidity-related risk limits\nare established within our Enterprise\nLiquidity Management Policy\n\n76 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nand supporting policies. Management\ncommittees, including the Asset and Liability\nCommittee, and the Board of Directors and its\nRisk Committee regularly review compliance\nwith key established limits.\n\nIn addition to these liquidity monitoring\nmeasures and tools described above, we also\nmonitor our liquidity by reference to the LCR\nwhich is further described in the Supervision\nand Regulation section in Item 1 of this\nReport. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on\na daily basis, and as of December 31, 2020,\nthe LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the\nrequirement of 100%.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements, including\ninformation on the 2019 Tailoring Rules, and\ntheir potential impact on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness and Item 1A Risk Factors of this\nReport.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits increased to\n$365.3 billion at December 31, 2020 from\n$288.5 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by\ngrowth in noninterest-bearing deposits and\ninterest-bearing deposits. See the Funding\nSources section of the Consolidated Balance\nSheet Review in this Item 7 for additional\ninformation related to our deposits.\nAdditionally, certain assets determined by us\nto be liquid as well as unused borrowing\ncapacity from a number of sources are also\navailable to manage our liquidity position.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, our liquid assets\nconsisted of cash and due from banks and\nshort-term investments (federal funds sold,\nresale agreements, trading securities and\ninterest-earning deposits with banks) totaling\n$95.1 billion and securities available for\nsale totaling $87.4 billion. The level of\nliquid assets fluctuates over time based on\nmany factors, including market conditions,\nloan and deposit growth and balance sheet\nmanagement activities. Our liquid assets\nincluded $22.7 billion of securities available\nfor sale and trading securities pledged as\ncollateral to secure public and trust\ndeposits, repurchase agreements and for other\npurposes. In addition, $0.1 billion of\nsecurities held to maturity were also pledged\nas collateral for these purposes.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings). See Note 10\nBorrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 and the Funding\nSources section of the Consolidated Balance\nSheet Review in this Item 7 for additional\ninformation related to our borrowings.\n\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a\nconsolidated basis, decreased due to the\nfollowing activity:\n                                              \n  Table 27: Senior and Subordinated Debt      \n                                              \n                                         \n  In billions                      2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01               $  35.1        \n  Issuances                   3.5        \n  Calls and maturities       -9.0        \n  Other                       1.1        \n  December\u00a031             $  30.7        \n                                         \n                                              \n  Bank Liquidity                              \n                                              \nUnder PNC Bank\u2019s 2014 bank note program, as\namended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer\nup to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount\noutstanding at any one time of its unsecured\nsenior and subordinated notes with maturity\ndates more than nine months (in the case of\nsenior notes) and five years or more (in the\ncase of subordinated notes) from their date of\nissue.

The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nDecember 31, 2020, our unused secured\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank totaled $81.1\nbillion. The Federal Reserve also has\nestablished certain special liquidity\nfacilities under its emergency lending\nauthority in Section 13(3) of the Federal\nReserve Act in response to the economic\nimpacts of the pandemic. For additional\ninformation, see the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of December 31, 2020,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains adequate liquidity to\nfund discretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $14.1 billion.\nParent company liquidity is held in\nintercompany cash. Investments with longer\ndurations may also be acquired, but if so, the\nrelated maturities are aligned with scheduled\ncash needs, such as the maturity of parent\ncompany debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends it receives from\nPNC Bank, which may be impacted by the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws and regulations,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was approximately $3.1 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. See Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report for a\nfurther discussion of these limitations.\n\n78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Authorized by the Board of\nDirectors, the parent company has the ability\nto offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial\npaper to provide additional liquidity.

exposure and\nSupplementary leverage ratio reflects the\ntemporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks. The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account both on balance sheets assets as\nwell as certain off-balance sheet items,\nincluding loan commitments and potential\nfuture exposure under derivative contracts.\n\n(e) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(f) The Basel III Total risk-based capital\nratios include nonqualifying trust preferred\ncapital securities of $40 million that are\nsubject to a phase-out period that runs\nthrough 2021.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring\nRules became effective for PNC. The most\nsignificant changes involve PNC\u2019s election to\n\nexclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital\nand higher thresholds used to calculate CET1\ncapital deductions. Effective January 1, 2020,\nPNC must deduct from CET1 capital investments\nin unconsolidated financial institutions,\nmortgage servicing rights and deferred tax\nassets (in each case, net of associated\ndeferred tax liabilities) to the extent such\nitems individually exceed 25% of the\ninstitution\u2019s adjusted CET1 capital.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 81\nExposures to high volatility commercial real\nestate, nonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures\nand equity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\n\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date compared to the CECL ACL at\ntransition. The estimated CECL impact is added\nto CET1 capital through December 31, 2021,\nthen phased-out over the following three\nyears. PNC elected to adopt this optional\ntransition provision effective as of March 31,\n2020. See additional discussion of this rule\nin the Supervision and Regulation section of\nItem 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of\nthis Report.\n\nIn response to the economic conditions caused\nby the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has\nadopted a final rule that revises, on a\n\ntemporary basis, the calculation of\nsupplementary leverage exposure (the\ndenominator of the SLR) by BHCs to exclude the\non-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks. The rule was effective as of April 14,\n2020 and will remain in effect through March\n31, 2021. The OCC also has permitted national\nbanks to exclude such on-balance sheet amounts\nfrom the bank\u2019s supplementary leverage\nexposure, provided the bank agrees to obtain\nOCC approval of capital distributions during\nthe effective period of the exclusion. PNC\nBank has not elected to take advantage of this\nOCC rule.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank, our\nsole bank subsidiary, were both considered\n\u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on applicable U.S.\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. To\nqualify as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, PNC must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6% for\nTier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for\nCommon equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8%\nfor Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at\nleast 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our December 31,\n2020 capital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report.

We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily by our involvement in\nthe following activities, among others:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans,\n\n\u2022 Equity and other investments and activities\nwhose economic values are directly impacted by\nmarket factors, and\n\n\u2022 Fixed income securities, derivatives and\nforeign exchange activities, as a result of\ncustomer activities and securities\nunderwriting.\n\nWe have established enterprise-wide policies\nand methodologies to identify, measure,\nmonitor and report market risk.

PNC holds instruments and services its\ninstruments and instruments owned by others\nthat may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC, like other\nfinancial participants, to financial, legal,\noperational, and reputational risks.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, PNC has established a cross-\nfunctional governance structure to oversee the\noverall strategy for the transition from LIBOR\nand mitigate risks associated with the\ntransition. An initial LIBOR impact and risk\nassessment has been performed, which\nidentified the associated risks across\nproducts, systems, models, and processes. PNC\nalso established an enterprise-level program,\nwhich is actively monitoring PNC\u2019s overall\nfirm-wide exposure to LIBOR and using these\nresults to plan transitional strategies and\ntrack progress versus these goals. Program\nworkstreams were formed by Line of Business to\nensure accountability and alignment with the\nappropriate operational, technology, and\ncustomer-facing stakeholders, while\nestablishing a centralized Program Management\nOffice to ensure consistency in execution and\ncommunication. Project plans and established\nmilestones have been developed and have\ncontinued to evolve and be refined in line\nwith industry developments and internal\ndecisions and progress. PNC is also involved\nin industry discussions, preparing milestones\nfor readiness and assessing progress against\nthose milestones, along with developing and\ndelivering on internal and external LIBOR\ncessation communication plans.\n\nKey efforts in 2020 included:\n\n\u2022 Enhancing fallback language in new contracts\nand reviewing existing legal\ncontracts/agreements to assess fallback\nlanguage impacts,\n\n\u2022 Making preparations for internal operational\nreadiness,\n\n\u2022 Making necessary enhancements to PNC\u2019s\ninfrastructure, including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes,\n\n\u2022 Developing and delivering on internal and\nexternal LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n\n\u2022 Engaging with PNC clients, industry working\ngroups and regulators, and\n\n\u2022 Monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments.\n\nPNC also has been an active participant in\nefforts with the Federal Reserve and other\nregulatory agencies to explore the potential\nneed for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to\nSOFR for use in commercial loans. Those\nefforts led to the formation of the Credit\nSensitive Group, which has held a series of\nworkshops to assess how a credit-sensitive\nrate or add-on to SOFR might be constructed\nand discuss associated implementation issues.\n\nIn addition, in the third quarter of 2020, PNC\nbegan offering conforming ARMs using SOFR\ninstead of USD LIBOR in line with Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac requirements. Plans are in\nplace to begin offering private student loans\nand portfolio loans using non-LIBOR rates in\nthe second quarter of 2021. PNC has provided\nregular updates to Federal Reserve, OCC and\nFDIC examination staff regarding its LIBOR\ncessation and transition plans.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical correlations across different asset\nclasses. We calculate a diversified VaR at a\n95% confidence interval and the results for\n2020 and 2019 were within our acceptable\nlimits.\n\nTo help ensure the integrity of the models\nused to calculate VaR for each portfolio and\nenterprise-wide, we use a process known as\nbacktesting. The backtesting process consists\nof comparing actual observations of gains or\nlosses against the VaR levels that were\ncalculated at the close of the prior day. Our\nVaR measure assumes that exposures remain\nconstant and that recent market variability is\na good predictor of future variability. Actual\nobservations include customer related revenue\nand intraday hedging which helps to reduce\nlosses and can reduce the number of instances\nactual losses exceed the prior day VaR\nmeasure. There were minimal instances during\n2020 and 2019 under our diversified VaR\nmeasure where actual losses exceeded the prior\nday VaR measure and those losses were\ninsignificant. Our portfolio and enterprise-\nwide VaR models utilize a historical approach\nwith a 500 day look back period.\n\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $466\nmillion in 2020 compared with $285 million in\n2019 and is recorded in Other noninterest\nincome and Other interest income on our\nConsolidated Income Statement. The increase\nwas primarily due to the impact of the changes\nin credit valuations for customer-related\nderivative activities and higher derivative\nclient sales revenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.5\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. As\nof December 31, 2020, $1.3 billion was\ninvested directly in a variety of companies\nand $0.2 billion was invested indirectly\nthrough various private equity funds. See the\nSupervision and Regulation section in Item 1\nof this Report for discussion of the potential\nimpacts of the Volcker Rule on our interests\nin and of private funds covered by the Volcker\nRule.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the December 31, 2020\nper share closing price of $218.73 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.2 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was not\nsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements. The estimated\nvalue does not represent fair value of the\nVisa B common shares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were not significant during 2020\nand 2019.\n                                              \n  Impact of Inflation                         \n                                              \nOur assets and liabilities are primarily\nfinancial in nature and typically have varying\nmaturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in\nprices do not affect the obligations to pay or\nreceive fixed and determinable amounts of\nmoney. However, during periods of inflation,\nthere may be a subsequent impact affecting\ncertain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of\nconsumer and customer purchasing power, and\nfluctuations in the need or demand for our\nproducts and services. Should significant\nlevels of inflation occur, our business could\npotentially be impacted by, among other\nthings, reducing our tolerance for extending\ncredit or causing us to incur additional\ncredit losses resulting from possible\nincreased default rates.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities.

Strong operational\nrisk management and well-informed risk-based\ndecisions benefit us by improving the customer\nexperience, enhancing compliance, reducing\nreputational risk, minimizing losses and\nestablishing an appropriate amount of required\noperational risk capital held by us.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is\ndesigned to provide effective and consistent\nmanagement of operational risk. The primary\npurpose of the framework is to enable us to\nunderstand our operational risks and manage\nthem to the desired risk profile, in line with\nour Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance\nestablished within the framework enables\nmanagement to make well-informed risk-based\nbusiness decisions.\n\nThe framework provides a disciplined and\nstructured process for us to manage\noperational risk across eight operational risk\ndomains. These domains provide a comprehensive\nview of operational risk and allow us to\ndiscuss operational risk in a standard way,\nfacilitating reporting and ongoing risk\nmitigation.\n\nThe operational risk domains are:\n\n\u2022 Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate\nor failed internal processes, misconduct or\nerrors of people or fraud.\n\n\u2022 Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory\nsanctions, financial loss, or damage to\nreputation resulting from failure to comply\nwith laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory\nstandards, or other regulatory requirements.\n\n\u2022 Data Management: Risk associated with\nincomplete or inaccurate data.\n\n\u2022 Model: Risk associated with the design,\nimplementation, and ongoing use and management\nof a model.\n\n\u2022 Technology and Systems: Risk associated with\nthe use, operation, and adoption of\ntechnology.\n\n\u2022 Information Security: Risk resulting from\nthe failure to protect information and ensure\nappropriate access to, and use and handling of\ninformation assets.\n\n\u2022 Business Continuity: Risk of potential\ndisruptive events to business activities.\n\n\u2022 Third Party: Risk arising from failure of\nthird party providers to conduct activity in a\nsafe and sound manner and in compliance with\ncontract provisions and applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nWe utilize operational risk management\nprograms within the framework, including Risk\nControl and Self-Assessments, scenario\nanalysis, and internal and external loss event\nreview and analysis, to assess existing risks,\ndetermine potential/emerging risks and\nevaluate the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols.

Note 1 Accounting Policies in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report describes the most\nsignificant accounting policies that we use.\nCertain of these policies require us to make\nestimates or economic assumptions that may\nvary under different assumptions or\nconditions, and such variations may\nsignificantly affect our reported results and\nfinancial position for the period or in future\nperiods.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13 -\nCredit Losses, commonly referred to as the\nCECL standard. The following discussion\nrelates to our ACL, post implementation of\nCECL. For additional information on our\nallowances for loan and lease losses and\nunfunded loan commitments and letters of\ncredit prior to this adoption see Note 1\nAccounting Policies and Critical Accounting\nEstimates and Judgments in our 2019 Form 10-K.\n\nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases (including residual\nvalues), other financial assets and unfunded\nlending related commitments, for the remaining\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures,\ntaking into consideration expected\nprepayments. Our determination of the ACL is\nbased on historical loss experience, current\nborrower characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We use methods sensitive to\nchanges in economic conditions to interpret\nthese factors to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate ACL on an\nongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to\nreflect in the ACL our best estimate of\namounts that we do not expect to collect\nbecause of, among other things, idiosyncratic\nrisk factors, changes in economic conditions\nthat may not be reflected in forecasted\nresults, or other potential methodology\nweaknesses. The ACL estimates are therefore\nsusceptible to various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, the following major factors:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions and borrower\nquality: Our forecast of expected losses\ndepends on conditions and portfolio\n\nquality as of the estimation date. As current\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape and\nseverity of macroeconomic forecasts and thus\n\nvary significantly between upside and downside\nscenarios. Change to probability weights\nassigned to these scenarios and\n\ntiming of peak business cycles reflected by\nthe scenarios could materially affect our loss\nestimates.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                  Form 10-K 87\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nCECL RAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s CECL RAC, and the committee determines\nand approves CECL scenarios\u2019 weights for use\nfor the current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020 were designed to reflect the\neconomic recovery that began in May, which\nconsistently outpaced market expectations and\nremained strong through the end of the year,\nbut has begun to show signs of an impending\nslowdown. We used a number of economic\nvariables in our scenarios, with the most\nsignificant drivers being GDP and unemployment\nrate measures. Using the weighted-average of\nour four economic forecast scenarios, we\nestimated that GDP grew 3.0% in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 finishing the year down 2.8%\nfrom fourth quarter 2019 levels with 2.3%\ngrowth in 2021, recovering to pre-recession\npeak levels in the first quarter of 2022. The\nweighted-average unemployment rate was\nestimated to rise to 7.8% in the first quarter\nof 2021, with the labor market beginning to\nrecover again in third quarter 2021, and\nending 2021 at 6.8%. The unemployment rate was\nestimated to reach 5.7% and 5.0% by the end of\n2022 and 2023, respectively. One of the\nscenarios included in our weighted-average is\nour baseline prediction of the most likely\neconomic outcome; which includes estimated GDP\nrecovering to pre-pandemic l evels in late\n2021 with unemployment not expected to return\nto its pre-pandemic level until at least 2023.\nSee our Business Outlook and the Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation in this Item 7 for additional\ndiscussion on our baseline prediction of the\nmost likely economic outcome. While the\neconomy saw significant recovery from the\nonset of the pandemic in national level\nmacroeconomic indicators, considerabl e\nuncertainty remains regarding overall lifetime\nloss content for both our commercial and\nconsumer portfolios, specifically as it\nrelates to our customers that are less likely\nto benefit from the economic recovery\ncurrently underway. For commercial borrowers,\nthere are substantial concerns around\nindustries that are dependent on in-person\ngatherings, hospitality and tourism. For\nconsumer borrowers, payment behavior once the\nCARES Act stimulus wanes is also difficult to\npredict but we believe the highest uncertainty\nis concentrated within consumer borrowers who\nhave been afforded accommodation as it relates\nto payment deferral/forbearance. As such, for\nboth our commercial and consumer loan\nportfolios, PNC identified and performed\nsignificant analysis around these key, highly\nimpacted segments to ensure our reserves were\nadequate in light of the improved economic\nenvironment. We believe that the economic\nassumptions used in the scenarios for the\nfourth quarter of 2020, in combination with\nincreased reserves for borrowers in segments\nmost adversely impacted by the pandemic,\nsufficiently reflect the life of loan losses\nin the current portfolio.\n\nFor internal analytical purposes, we\nconsidered what our capital ratios would be if\nwe had an ACL at December 31, 2020 equal to\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s estimated nine quarter\ncredit losses for PNC under the 2020 CCAR\nsupervisory severely adverse scenario of $12.1\nbillion, increasing the reserves by\napproximately $6.0 billion at year end. This\nanalysis resulted in a CET1 ratio of\napproximately 10.6% at December 31, 2020, a\nlevel well above 7.0%, which is our regulatory\nminimum of 4.5% plus our SCB of 2.5%. This\nscenario was not our expectation at December\n31, 2020 and does not reflect our current\nexpectation, nor does it capture all the\npotential unknown variables, but it provides\nan approximation of a possible outcome under\nhypothetical severe conditions. The CECL\nmethodology inherently requires a high degree\nof judgment. As a result, it is possible that\nwe may, at another point in time, reach\ndifferent conclusions regarding our credit\nloss estimates.\n\nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing\nRights\n\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value.\nThis election was made to be consistent with\nour risk management strategy to hedge changes\nin the fair value of these assets. The fair\nvalue of our MSRs is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model\n\n88 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nwhich calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows,\ntaking into consideration actual and expected\nmortgage loan prepayment rates, discount\nrates, servicing costs, and other factors\nwhich are determined based on current market\nconditions.\n\nWe employ risk management strategies designed\nto protect the value of MSRs from changes in\ninterest rates and related market factors. The\nvalues of the MSRs are economically hedged\nwith securities and derivatives, including\ninterest-rate swaps, options, and forward\nmortgage-backed and futures contracts. As\ninterest rates change, these financial\ninstruments are expected to have changes in\nfair value negatively correlated to the change\nin fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios.\nThe hedge relationships are actively managed\nin response to changing market conditions over\nthe life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate\nfinancial instruments to economically hedge\nresidential or commercial MSRs requires\nsignificant management judgment to assess how\nmortgage rates and prepayment speeds could\naffect the future values of MSRs. Hedging\nresults can frequently be less predictable in\nthe short term, but over longer periods of\ntime are expected to protect the economic\nvalue of the MSRs.\n\nFor additional information on our residential\nand commercial MSRs, see Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage\nServicing Rights and Note 15 Fair Value in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report.\n                                              \n  Fair Value Measurements                     \n                                              \nWe must use estimates, assumptions and\njudgments when assets and liabilities are\nrequired to be recorded at, or adjusted to\nreflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value inherently result in a\nhigher degree of financial statement\nvolatility. Fair values and the information\nused to record valuation adjustments for\ncertain assets and liabilities are based on\neither quoted market prices or are provided by\nindependent third-party sources, including\nappraisers and valuation specialists, when\navailable. When such third-party information\nis not available, we estimate fair value\nprimarily by using cash flow and other\nfinancial modeling techniques. Changes in\nunderlying factors, assumptions, or estimates\nin any of these areas could materially impact\nour future financial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nWe apply ASC 820 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\nThis guidance defines fair value as the price\nthat would be received to sell a financial\nasset or paid to transfer a financial\nliability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nThis guidance requires a three level hierarchy\nfor disclosure of assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value. The classification of\nassets and liabilities within the hierarchy is\nbased on whether the inputs to the valuation\nmethodology used in the measurement are\nobservable or unobservable. Level 3 assets and\nliabilities are those where the fair value is\nestimated using significant unobservable\ninputs.\n\nFor additional information on fair value\nmeasurements, see Note 15 Fair Value

 Form 10-K 89\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d

numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake to update forward-looking\nstatements. Actual results or future events\ncould differ, possibly materially, from those\nanticipated in forward-looking statements, as\nwell as from historical performance. As a\nresult, we caution against placing undue\nreliance on any forward-looking statements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u25aa Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply and\nmarket interest rates,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies\nof the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n\n\u2013 The length and extent of the economic\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n\u2013 The impact of the results of the recent U.S.\nelections on the regulatory landscape, capital\nmarkets, and the response to and management of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there\nwill be additional fiscal stimulus from the\nfederal government and, if so, its size, scope\nand effectiveness, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u25aa Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\n\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\n\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2013 Despite the improvement in the economy since\nthe spring of 2020, economic activity remains\nfar below its pre-pandemic level and\nunemployment remains elevated.\n\n\u2013 Growth will be much weaker in early 2021\nbecause of record COVID-19 cases and continued\ngovernment restrictions of economic activity.\nGrowth should then pick up in the spring of\n2021 as vaccines are more widely available and\nthe federal government provides aid to\nhouseholds and small and medium-sized\nbusinesses. PNC does not expect real GDP to\nreturn to its pre-pandemic level until late\n2021, and does not expect employment to return\nto its pre-pandemic level until at least 2023.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25%\nthrough at least mid-2024.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding a stress capital buffer established\nby the Federal Reserve Board in connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\nThe Federal Reserve also has imposed\nadditional limitations on capital\ndistributions through the first quarter of\n2021 by CCAR-participating bank holding\ncompanies and may extend these limitations,\npotentially in modified form.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our planned acquisition of BBVA presents us\nwith risks and uncertainties related both to\nthe acquisition transaction itself and to the\nintegration of the acquired business into PNC\nafter closing:\n\n\u2013 The business of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, going forward\nmay not perform as we currently project or in\na manner consistent with historical\nperformance. As a result, the anticipated\nbenefits, including estimated cost savings, of\nthe transaction may be significantly harder or\ntake longer to achieve than expected or may\nnot be achieved in their entirety as a result\nof unexpected factors or events, including\nthose that are outside of our control.\n\n\u2013 The combination of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with that of PNC\nand PNC Bank may be more difficult to achieve\nthan anticipated or have unanticipated adverse\nresults relating to BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, or our existing\nbusinesses.\n\n\u2013 Completion of the transaction is dependent\non the satisfaction of customary closing\nconditions, which cannot be assured.

We also have audited the\nCompany's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2020 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCOSO.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company changed the\nmanner in which it accounts for the allowance\nfor credit losses in 2020.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinions                          \n                                              \nThe Company's management is responsible for\nthese consolidated financial statements, for\nmaintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\n92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matter communicated below\nis a matter arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter\nor on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\n\nAllowance for Loans and Lease Losses \u2013\nCommercial Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loans and lease losses was\napproximately $5,361 million as of December\n31, 2020, of which $3,337 million relates to\ncommercial loans. For commercial loans, the\ndetermination of the allowance is based on\nhistorical loss experience, current borrower\nrisk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\neconomic forecasts and other relevant factors.\nAs disclosed by management, the Company has\nestablished a framework for developing the\nreasonable and supportable economic forecasts,\nwhich includes the use of four economic\nforecast scenarios and associated probability\nweights, which in combination create a\nforecast of expected economic outcomes. To\ngenerate the four economic forecast scenarios,\nthe Company uses a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking judgment\nto forecast the distribution of economic\noutcomes. The economic forecast scenarios\nwhich are inputs into the credit loss models,\ninclude a number of economic variables with\nthe most significant drivers being GDP and\nunemployment rate measures. Also included in\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans are qualitative reserves to\ncover losses that are expected but, in the\nCompany\u2019s assessment, may not be adequately\nrepresented in the quantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions. For example, qualitative\nfactors that the Company considers include\nindustry concentration and conditions, changes\nin market conditions, recent credit quality\ntrends, model imprecision, the impacts of\nCOVID-19 on highly impacted segments, and\nother factors.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in developing\neconomic forecast scenarios, determining\nweighting of each scenario, and estimating\nqualitative reserves related to the impacts of\nCOVID-19 on certain highly impacted segments,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in evaluating audit\nevidence obtained and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans,\nincluding controls over the development and\napproval of economic forecast scenarios,\nrelated weightings, and qualitative reserves.\nThese procedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for estimating\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans, including (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness and methodology of certain\nloss forecasting models (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain borrower risk\ncharacteristics, (iii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain forecasted economic\nvariables such as GDP and unemployment\nmeasures, (iv) evaluating the reasonableness\nof management\u2019s weighting of economic forecast\nscenarios used in the loss forecast models,\n(v) testing the completeness and accuracy of\ndata used in the estimate, and (vi) evaluating\ncertain qualitative reserves made to the model\noutput results to determine the overall\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans. The procedures also included\nthe involvement of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating certain models, model inputs,\neconomic forecasts, and qualitative reserves\nin the commercial allowance estimate.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nFebruary 26, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since\n2007.\n The

Our retail branch network is\nlocated primarily in markets across the Mid-\nAtlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have\nstrategic international offices in\nfourcountries outside the U.S.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  1 A                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING P OLICIES                         \n                                              \nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of the parent company and its\nsubsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned,\ncertain partnership interests and variable\ninterest entities.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to our fair\nvalue measurements and the ACL. Actual results\nmay differ from the estimates and the\ndifferences may be material to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations\nA disposal of an asset or business that meets\nthe criteria for held for sale classification\nis reported as discontinued operations when\nthe disposal represents a strategic shift that\nhas had, or will have a major effect on our\noperating results. We report an asset as held\nfor sale when management has approved or\nreceived approval to sell the asset and is\ncommitted to a formal plan, the asset is\navailable for immediate sale, the asset is\nbeing actively marketed, the sale is\nanticipated to occur during the ensuing year\nand certain other specified criteria are met.\nAn asset classified as held for sale is\nrecorded at the lower of its carrying amount\nor estimated fair value less cost to sell. If\nthe carrying amount of the asset exceeds its\nestimated fair value, the asset is written\ndown to its fair value upon the held for sale\ndesignation. Our BlackRock held for sale asset\nis recorded at its carrying amount as we\naccounted for this investment under the equity\nmethod of accounting and the fair value of the\nasset exceeded the carrying value at each\nbalance sheet date.\nWhen presenting discontinued operations,\nassets classified as held for sale are\nsegregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ncommencing in the period in which the asset\nmeets all of the held for sale criteria\ndescribed above and prior periods are recast.\nThe results of discontinued operations are\nreported in discontinued operations in the\nConsolidated Income Statement for current and\nprior periods commencing in the period in\nwhich the asset or business is either disposed\nof or is classified as held for sale,\nincluding any gain or loss recognized on the\nsale or adjustment of the carrying amount to\nfair value less cost to sell.\n100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022Commonly                    \n                 referred to                  \n                 as the CECL                  \n                 standard.                    \n                 \u2022 Replaces                   \n                 measuremen\u2026                  \n                 recognition    \u2022 Adopted     \n                 and            January 1,    \n                 disclosure     2020 under    \n                 guidance       the modified  \n                 for credit     retrospecti\u2026  \n                 related        approach.     \n                 reserves       The           \n                 (i.e., ALLL    cumulative-\u2026  \n                 and the        adjustment    \n                 allowance      to retained   \n                 for            earnings      \n                 unfunded       totaled $671  \n                 loan           million at    \n                 commitments    adoption.     \n                 and letters    \u2022 Amended     \n                 of credit)     presentation  \n                 and OTTI       and           \n                 for debt       disclosures   \n                 securities.    are required  \n                 \u2022 Requires     prospective\u2026  \n                 the use of     Refer to the  \n                 an expected    disclosures   \n                 credit loss    in this Note  \n                 methodolog\u2026    1, Note 3     \n                 specifical\u2026    Investment    \n                 current        Securities    \n                 expected       and Note 4    \n                 credit         Loans and     \n                 losses for     Related       \n                 the            Allowance     \n                 remaining      for Credit    \n                 life of the    Losses for    \n                 asset will     additional    \n                 be             information.  \n                 recognized     \u2022 With the    \n                 starting       adoption of   \n                 from the       CECL, we      \n                 time of        discontinued  \n  Credit         origination    the           \n  Losses -       or             accounting    \n  ASU 2016-13    acquisitio\u2026    for           \n  Issued June    \u2022              purchased     \n  2016           Methodology    impaired      \n  Codificati\u2026    applies to     loans and     \n  Improvemen\u2026    loans, net     elected the   \n  - ASU          investment     one-time      \n  2019-04        in leases,     fair value    \n  Various        debt           option        \n  improvemen\u2026    securities     election for  \n  related to     and certain    some of       \n  Credit         financial      these loans   \n  Losses         assets not     and certain   \n  (Topics 1,     accounted      residential   \n  2 and 5)       for at fair    real estate   \n  Issued         value          collateral    \n  April 2019     through net    dependent     \n  Targeted       income.

due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a primary\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nInvestments\nWe hold interests in various types of\ninvestments. The accounting for these\ninvestments is dependent on a number of\nfactors including, but not limited to, items\nsuch as:\n\u2022 Ownership interest,\n\u2022 Our plans for the investment, and\n\u2022 The nature of the investment.\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date\nbasis. We classify debt securities as either\ntrading, held to maturity, or available for\nsale. Debt securities that we purchase for\ncertain risk management activities or\ncustomer-related trading activities are\nclassified as trading securities, are reported\nin the Other assets line item on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and are carried at\nfair value. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses on trading securities are included in\nOther noninterest income. We classify debt\nsecurities as held to maturity when we have\nthe positive intent and ability to hold the\nsecurities to maturity, and carry them at\namortized cost, less any allowance. Debt\nsecurities not classified as held to maturity\nor trading are classified as securities\navailable for sale, and are carried at fair\nvalue. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale securities are included in\nAOCI net of income taxes.\nWe include all interest on debt securities,\nincluding amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on investment\nsecurities, in net interest income using the\nconstant effective yield method generally\ncalculated over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities. Effective yields reflect either\nthe effective interest rate implicit in the\nsecurity at the date of acquisition or, for\ndebt securities where an OTTI was recorded,\nthe effective interest rate determined based\non improved cash flows subsequent to an\nimpairment. We compute gains and losses\nrealized on the sale of available for sale\ndebt securities on a specific security basis.\nThese securities gains/(losses) are included\nin Other noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\nAs discussed in the Recently Adopted\nAccounting Standards section of this Note 1,\nwe adopted the CECL standard as of January 1,\n2020, which requires expected credit losses on\nboth held to maturity and available for sale\nsecurities to be recognized through a\nvaluation allowance, ACL, instead of as a\ndirect write-down to the amortized cost basis\nof the security. An available for sale\nsecurity is considered impaired if the fair\nvalue is less than its amortized cost basis.\nIf any portion of the decline in fair value is\nrelated to credit, the amount of allowance is\ndetermined as the portion related to credit,\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis and the fair value of the\nsecurity. If we have the intent to sell or\nbelieve it is more likely than not we will be\nrequired to sell an impaired available for\nsale security before recovery of the amortized\ncost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a\ndirect write-down of the amortized cost basis.\nCredit losses on investment securities are\nrecognized through the Provision for credit\nlosses on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nDeclines in the fair value of available for\nsale securities that are not considered credit\nrelated are recognized in AOCI on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The CECL standard\nis applied prospectively to debt securities\nand, as a result, the amortized cost basis of\ninvestment securities for which OTTI had\npreviously been recorded did not change upon\nadoption.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, we reviewed all\ndebt securities that were in an unrealized\nloss position for OTTI. An investment security\nwas deemed impaired if the fair value of the\ninvestment was less than its amortized cost.\nAfter an investment security was determined to\nbe impaired, we evaluated whether the decline\nin value was other-than-temporary. Declines in\nthe fair value of debt securities that were\ndeemed other-than-temporary and were\nattributable to credit deterioration were\nrecognized in Other noninterest income on our\nConsolidated Income Statement in the period in\nwhich the determination was made. Declines in\nfair value which were deemed other-than-\ntemporary and attributable to factors other\nthan credit deterioration were recognized in\nAOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe consider a security to be past due in terms\nof payment based on its contractual terms. A\nsecurity may be placed on nonaccrual, with\ninterest no longer recognized until received,\nwhen collectability of principal or interest\nis doubtful. As of December 31, 2020,\nnonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity\nsecurities were immaterial.\nA security may be partially or fully charged\noff against the allowance if it is determined\nto be uncollectible, including, for an\navailable for sale security, if we have the\nintent to sell or believe it is more likely\nthan not we will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of the amortized cost\nbasis. Recoveries of previously charged-off\navailable for sale securities are recognized\nwhen received, while recoveries on held to\nmaturity securities are recognized when\nexpected.\nSee the Allowance for Credit Losses section of\nthis Note 1 for further discussion regarding\nthe methodologies used to determine the\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 103\nallowance for investment securities. See Note\n3 Investment Securities for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio and the related ACL.\n\nEquity Securities and Partnership Interests\n\nWe account for equity securities, equity\ninvestments, private equity investments, and\ninvestments in limited partnerships, limited\nliability companies and other investments that\nare not required to be consolidated under one\nof the following methods:\n\n\u2022 We use the equity method for general and\nlimited partner ownership interests and\nlimited liability companies in which we are\nconsidered to have significant influence over\nthe operations of the investee. Under the\nequity method, we record our equity ownership\nshare of net income or loss of the investee in\nNoninterest income and any dividends received\non equity method investments are recorded as a\nreduction to the investment balance. When an\nequity investment experiences an other-than-\ntemporary decline in value, we may be required\nto record a loss on the investment.\n\n\u2022 We measure equity securities that have a\nreadily determinable fair value at fair value\nthrough Net income. Both realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are included in\nNoninterest income. Dividend income on these\nequity securities is included in Other\ninterest income on our Consolidated Income\nStatement.\n\n\u2022 We generally use the practicability\nexception to fair value measurement for all\nother investments without a readily\ndeterminable fair value. When we elect this\nalternative measurement method, the investment\nis recorded at cost and the carrying value is\nadjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus\nchanges in value resulting from observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for\nidentical or similar instruments of the same\nissuer. These investments are written down to\nfair value if a qualitative assessment\nindicates impairment and the fair value is\nless than the carrying value. The amount of\nthe write-down is accounted for as a loss\nincluded in Noninterest income. Distributions\nreceived on these investments are included in\nNoninterest income.\n\nInvestments described above are included in\nEquity investments on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\nPrivate Equity Investments\n\nWe report private equity investments, which\ninclude direct investments in companies,\naffiliated partnership interests and indirect\ninvestments in private equity funds, at\nestimated fair value. These estimates are\nbased on available information and may not\nnecessarily represent amounts that we will\nultimately realize through distribution, sale\nor liquidation of the investments. Fair values\nof publicly-traded direct investments are\ndetermined using quoted market prices and are\nsubject to various discount factors arising\nfrom security level restrictions, when\nappropriate. The valuation procedures applied\nto direct investments and indirect investments\nare detailed in Note 15 Fair Value. We include\nall private equity investments within Equity\ninvestments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in fair value of private equity\ninvestments are recognized in Other\nnoninterest income.\n\nWe consolidate affiliated partnerships when we\nhave determined that we have control of the\npartnership or are the primary beneficiary if\nthe entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own\nis reflected in Noncontrolling interests on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. See Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information on how COVID-19\nhardship related loan modifications are\nreported from a delinquency perspective as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method. Loan\norigination fees, direct loan origination\ncosts, and loan premiums and discounts are\ndeferred and accreted or amortized into Net\ninterest income using the constant effective\nyield method, over the contractual life of the\nloan. The processing fee received for loans\noriginated through PPP lending under the CARES\nAct is deferred and accreted into Net interest\nincome using the effective yield method, over\nthe contractual life of the loan. Loans under\nthe fair value option are reported at their\nfair value, with any changes to fair value\nreported as Noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement, and are\nexcluded from measurement of ALLL.\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination (i.e., PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nacquisition date. Subsequent decreases in\nexpected cash flows that are attributable, at\nleast in part, to credit quality are\nrecognized through a charge to the provision\nfor credit losses resulting in an increase in\nthe ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected\ncash flows are recognized as a provision\nrecapture of previously recorded ALLL .\n\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\n\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to\n\nmeasure the loan at the estimated fair value\nof collateral (less costs to sell if sale or\nforeclosure of the property is expected).\n\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable.\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. A concession has been\ngranted when we do not expect to collect all\namounts due, including original interest\naccrued at the original contract rate, as a\nresult of the restructuring, or there is a\ndelay in payment that is more than\ninsignificant. TDRs result from our loss\nmitigation activities, and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization, and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us. In those\nsituations where principal is forgiven, the\namount of such principal forgiveness is\nimmediately charged off.\n\nPotential incremental losses or recoveries on\nTDRs have been factored into the ALLL\nestimates for each loan class under the\nmethodologies described in this Note. Once a\nloan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be\nreported as a TDR until it is ultimately\nrepaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed\nupon or it is fully charged off.\n\nPNC excludes consumer loans held for sale,\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption and certain government insured or\nguaranteed loans from our TDR population. PCD\nloans do not require additional considerations\nand thus are evaluated for inclusion in our\nTDR population. In addition, PNC has elected\nnot to apply a TDR designation to loans that\nhave been restructured due to a COVID-19\nhardship pursuant to specific criteria under\nthe CARES Act. Since loans restructured due to\na COVID-19 related hardship were not\nidentified as TDRs, they are not placed on\nnonaccrual at the time of modification unless\npayment in full of principal or interest is\nnot expected. These loans continue to be\nsubject to our existing nonaccrual policy.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the

                   \nCommercial\n\nWe generally charge-off commercial (commercial\nand industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well-secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform.\n\nAdditionally, in general, for smaller\ncommercial loans of $100,000 or less, a full\ncharge-off occurs at 180days past due for term\nloans and revolvers. For smaller commercial\nleases of $1 million or less, a full charge-\noff occurs at 120days past due. Small business\ncredit card balances are charged-off at\n180days past due.\n\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell, if\nlower than the amortized cost basis of the\nloan outstanding, when delinquency of the\nloan, combined with other risk factors (e.g.,\nbankruptcy, lien position or troubled debt\nrestructuring), indicates that the loan, or\nsome portion thereof, is uncollectible as per\nour historical experience, or the collateral\nhas been repossessed. We charge-off secured\nconsumer loans no later than 180days past due.\nMost consumer loans and lines of credit, not\nsecured by automobiles or residential real\nestate, are charged-off once they have reached\n120- 180days past due.\n\n106 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected,\nlimited to amounts previously charged-off.\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, the current year\naccrued and uncollected interest is reversed\nthrough Net interest income and prior year\naccrued and uncollected interest is charged-\noff, except for credit cards, where we reverse\nany accrued interest through Net interest\nincome at the time of charge-off, as per\nindustry standard practice. Nonaccrual loans\nthat are also collateral dependent may be\ncharged-off to reduce the basis to the fair\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance; payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as fee and interest income. For\ncertain consumer loans, the receipt of\ninterest payments is recognized as interest\nincome on a cash basis. Cash basis income\nrecognition is applied if a loan\u2019s amortized\ncost basis is deemed fully collectible and the\nloan has performed for at least six months.\n\nFor TDRs, payments are applied based upon\ntheir contractual terms unless the related\nloan is deemed non-performing. TDRs are\ngenerally included in nonperforming and\nnonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable\nperiod of time, generally six months, in which\nthe loan performs under restructured terms and\nmeets other performance indicators, it is\nreturned to performing/accruing status. This\nreturn to performing/accruing status\ndemonstrates that the bank expects to collect\nall of the loan\u2019s remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest. TDRs resulting from\n(i) borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us, and (ii)\nborrowers that are not currently obligated to\nmake both principal and interest payments\nunder the restructured terms are not returned\nto accrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accrual status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collection of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal are not returned to accrual. When a\nnonperforming loan is returned to accrual\nstatus, it is then considered a performing\nloan.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\ncommercial and residential real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses in this Report for additional\ninformation on nonperforming assets, TDRs and\ncredit quality indicators related to our loan\nportfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL, in accordance with the CECL standard,\nis based on historical loss experience,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future conditions and\nother relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at\nan\nappropriate level for expected losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases (including residual\nvalues), other financial assets and unfunded\nlending related commitments, for the estimated\ncontractual term of the assets or exposures as\nof the balance sheet date. The remaining\ncontractual term of assets in scope of CECL is\nestimated considering contractual maturity\ndates, prepayment expectations, utilization or\ndraw expectations and any embedded extension\noptions that do not allow us to unilaterally\ncancel the extension options. For products\nwithout a fixed contractual maturity date (\ne.g ., credit cards), we rely on historical\npayment behavior to determine the length of\nthe paydown or default time period.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long run\naverage expected losses where applicable and\n(iii) the long run average expected\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 107\nlosses for the remaining estimated contractual\nterm. For all assets and unfunded lending\nrelated commitments in the scope of CECL, the\nACL also includes individually assessed\nreserves and qualitative reserves, as\napplicable.\n\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative techniques, analysis from PNC\neconomists and management judgment.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long run average expected\ncredit losses. We may consider a number of\nfactors in determining the duration of the\nreversion period, such as contractual maturity\nof the asset, observed historical patterns and\nthe estimated credit loss rates at the end of\nthe forecast period relative to the beginning\nof the long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio, and\ntherefore do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\n\nSee the following sections related to\ninvestment securities, loans, trade\nreceivables, other financial assets and\nunfunded lending related commitments for\ndetails about specific methodologies.\n\nAllowance for Investment Securities\n\nA significant portion of our investment\nsecurities are issued or guaranteed by either\nthe U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or GNMA) or\na government-sponsored agency (FNMA or FHLMC).\nTaking into consideration historical\ninformation and current and forecasted\nconditions, we do not expect to incur any\ncredit losses on these securities.\n\nInvestment securities that are not issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or a\ngovernment-sponsored agency consist of both\nsecuritized products, such as non-agency\nmortgage and asset-backed securities, as well\nas non-securitized products, such as corporate\nand municipal debt securities. A discounted\ncash flow approach is primarily used to\ndetermine the amount of the allowance\nrequired. The estimates of expected cash flows\nare determined using macroeconomic sensitive\nmodels taking into consideration the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period and\nscenarios discussed above. Additional factors\nunique to a specific security may also be\ntaken into consideration when estimating\nexpected cash flows. The cash flows expected\nto be collected, after considering expected\nprepayments, are discounted at the effective\ninterest rate. For an available-for-sale\nsecurity, the amount of the allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nestimated fair value.\n\nSee Note 3 Investment Securities in this\nReport for additional information about the\ninvestment securities portfolio.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan or loan\nsegment. We also consider the impact of\nprepayments and amortization on contractual\nmaturity in our expected loss estimates. We\nuse historical credit loss information,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables for the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\ncoupled with analytical methods, to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan or loan\nsegments. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario and\nthe long run average period, and combined to\ngenerate expected loss estimates by scenario.\nThe following matrix provides key credit risk\ncharacteristics that we use to estimate these\nrisk parameters.\n\n108 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n                                              \n

     \nAfter the forecast period, we revert to the\nlong run average over the reversion period\nnoted above, which is the period between the\nend of the forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate by loan class. We then add or deduct\nany qualitative components and other\nadjustments, such as individually assessed\nloans, to produce the ALLL. See the\nIndividually Assessed Component and\nQualitative Component discussions that follow\nin this Note 1 for additional information\nabout those adjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nIn addition to TDRs, we also use a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes. We\ndetermine effective interest rates considering\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for estimated\nprepayments. Changes in the ALLL due to the\nimpact of the passage of time under the\ndiscounted cash flow estimate are recognized\nthrough the provision for credit losses.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold,\nand accruing TDRs are reserved for under a\npooled basis.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged-off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses attributable to such risks. The ACL\nalso takes into account factors that may not\nbe directly measured in the determination of\nindividually assessed or pooled reserves. Such\nqualitative factors may include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\n110 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\nincluding the impacts of COVID-19 on highly\nimpacted segments,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends, including the\nimpact of COVID-19 hardship related loan\nmodifications,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macro-economic factors that may not\nbe reflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures,\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information, including\nthe performance of first lien positions.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses (Incurred\nLoss Methodology)\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, we maintained\nthe ALLL at a level that we believed to be\nappropriate to absorb estimated probable\ncredit losses incurred in the loan and lease\nportfolios as of the balance sheet date. These\nevaluations were inherently subjective, as\nthey required material estimates, and\nincluded, among others: PD, LGD, EAD, movement\nthrough delinquency stages, amounts and timing\nof expected future cash flows, value of\ncollateral and qualitative factors.\nFor all loans and leases, except purchased\nimpaired loans, the ALLL was the sum of three\ncomponents:\n\u2022 Asset specific/individual impaired reserves:\nNonperforming loans that were considered\nimpaired under ASC 310 \u2013 Receivables , which\nincluded all commercial and consumer TDRs,\nwere evaluated for specific reserves.\n\u2022 Quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves:\nQuantitative reserves in the commercial\nportfolio were determined through quantitative\nloss modeling utilizing PD, LGD, and the\noutstanding balance of the loan, while\nquantitative reserves in the consumer\nportfolio were determined primarily using\ntransition matrices, including a roll-rate\nmodel.\n\u2022 Qualitative (judgmental) reserves.\nThe reserve calculation and determination\nprocess was dependent on the use of key\nassumptions. Key reserve assumptions and\nestimation processes reacted to and were\ninfluenced by observed changes in loan\nportfolio performance experience, the\nfinancial strength of the borrowers and\neconomic conditions.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities and Nonperforming Loans\nand Leases sections of this Note 1 for\nadditional information on our nonaccrual and\ncharge-off policies.\nAdditionally, pursuant to our use of a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology in estimating\ncredit losses for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes,\napplicable reserves for accrued interest are\nalso included within the ALLL for these loan\nclasses .\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition\n(including January 1, 2020 when certain\npurchased impaired loans were grandfathered\nand transitioned to PCD upon adoption of\nCECL), as the estimated expected credit loss\nof the outstanding balance or par value, based\non the methodologies described previously for\nloans and securities. In accordance with CECL,\nthe allowance recognized at acquisition is\nadded to the acquisition date purchase price\nto determine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, acquired\npurchased impaired loans were recorded at fair\nvalue. When evidence of credit quality\ndeterioration and evidence that it was\nprobable that we would be unable to collect\nall contractual amounts due existed, we\nconsidered the loans to be purchased credit\nimpaired and we estimated the amount and\ntiming of undiscounted expected cash flows at\nacquisition for each loan either individually\nor on a pool basis. The excess of undiscounted\ncash flows expected to be collected over its\ncarrying value represented the accretable\nyield which was recognized into interest\nincome over the remaining life of the loan (or\npool of loans) using the constant effective\nyield method. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that were attributable to credit\nquality were recognized as impairments\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nwere recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL or prospectively\nthrough an adjustment of the loan\u2019s or pool\u2019s\nyield over its remaining life.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 111\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable (e.g., unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan\nand Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for\nthe key credit risk characteristics for\nunfunded lending related commitments. The\nallowance for unfunded lending related\ncommitments is recorded as a liability on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to\nthis reserve are included in the provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.\n\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, we maintained\nthe allowance for unfunded loan commitments\nand letters of credit at a level we believed\nwas appropriate to absorb estimated probable\ncredit losses incurred as of the balance sheet\ndate. We determined the allowance based on\nperiodic evaluations of the unfunded credit\nfacilities, including an assessment of the\nprobability of commitment usage, credit risk\nfactors, and, solely for commercial lending,\nthe terms and expiration dates of the unfunded\ncredit facilities. Other than the estimation\nof the probability of funding, the reserve for\nunfunded loan commitments was estimated in a\nmanner similar to the methodology used for\ndetermining reserves for funded exposures. The\nallowance for unfunded loan commitments and\nletters of credit was recorded as a liability\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net\nadjustments to the allowance for unfunded loan\ncommitments and letters of credit were\nincluded in the provision for credit losses.\n\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets\n\nWe determine the allowance for other financial\nassets (e.g., trade receivables, servicing\nadvances on PNC-owned loans, balances with\nbanks) considering historical loss information\nand other available indicators. In certain\ncases where there are no historical, current\nor forecast indicators of an expected credit\nloss, we may estimate the reserve to be close\nto zero. As of December 31, 2020, the\nallowance for other financial assets was\nimmaterial.\nLoans Held for Sale\nWe designate loans as held for sale when we\nhave the intent and ability to sell them. At\nthe time of designation to held for sale, any\nallowance is reversed, and a valuation\nallowance for the shortfall between the\namortized cost basis and the net realizable\nvalue is recognized, excluding the amounts\nalready charged off. Similarly, when loans are\nno longer considered held for sale, the\nvaluation allowance (net of writedowns) is\nreversed, and an allowance for credit losses\nis established, excluding the amounts already\ncharged-off. Write-downs on these loans (if\nrequired) are recorded as charge-offs through\nthe valuation allowance. Adjustments to the\nvaluation allowance on held for sale loans are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income.\nWe have elected to account for certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale at fair value. The changes in the\nfair value of the commercial mortgage loans\nare measured and recorded in Other noninterest\nincome while such changes for the residential\nmortgage loans are measured and recorded in\nResidential mortgage noninterest income each\nperiod. See Note 15 Fair Value for additional\ninformation.\nInterest income with respect to loans held for\nsale is accrued based on the principal amount\noutstanding and the loan\u2019s contractual\ninterest rate.\nIn certain circumstances, loans designated as\nheld for sale may be transferred to held for\ninvestment based on a change in strategy. We\ntransfer these loans at the lower of cost or\nestimated fair value; however, any loans\noriginated or purchased for the held for sale\nportfolio and for which the fair value option\nhas been elected remain at fair value for the\nlife of the loan.\nLoan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained\nInterests\nWe recognize the sale of loans or other\nfinancial assets when the transferred assets\nare legally isolated from our creditors and\nthe appropriate accounting criteria are met.\nWe have sold mortgage and other loans through\nsecuritization transactions. In a\nsecuritization, financial assets are\ntransferred into trusts or to SPEs in\ntransactions to effectively legally isolate\nthe assets from us.\nIn a securitization, the trust or SPE issues\nbeneficial interests in the form of senior and\nsubordinated securities backed or\ncollateralized by the assets sold to the\ntrust. The senior classes of the asset-backed\nsecurities typically receive investment grade\ncredit ratings at the time of issuance. These\nratings are generally achieved through the\ncreation of lower-rated subordinated classes\nof asset-backed securities, as well as\nsubordinated or residual interests. In certain\ncases, we may retain a portion or all of the\nsecurities issued, interest-only strips, one\nor more subordinated tranches, servicing\nrights and, in some cases, cash reserve\naccounts. Securitized loans are removed from\nthe balance sheet and a net gain or loss is\nrecognized in Noninterest income at the time\nof initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on\nthe sale of the loans depend on the fair value\nof the loans sold and the retained interests\nat the date of sale. We generally estimate the\nfair value of the retained interests based on\nthe present value of future expected cash\nflows using assumptions as to discount rates,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, credit\nlosses and servicing costs, if applicable.\n112 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nWith the exception of loan sales to certain\nU.S. government-chartered entities, our loan\nsales and securitizations are generally\nstructured without recourse to us except for\nrepresentations and warranties and with no\nrestrictions on the retained interests. We\noriginate, sell and service commercial\nmortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program.\nUnder the provisions of the DUS program, we\nparticipate in a loss-sharing arrangement with\nFNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing\nor recourse, our policy is to record such\nliabilities initially at fair value and\nsubsequently reserve for estimated losses in\naccordance with guidance contained in\napplicable GAAP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited\nliability company, or any other legal\nstructure used to conduct activities or hold\nassets generally that either:\n\u2022 Does not have equity investors with voting\nrights that can directly or indirectly make\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s most significant\neconomic activities through those voting\nrights or similar rights, or\n\u2022 Has equity investors that do not provide\nsufficient equity for the entity to finance\nits activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support.\nA VIE often holds financial assets, including\nloans or receivables, real estate or other\nproperty.\nVIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC\n810 \u2013 Consolidation when we hold a variable\ninterest in these entities. We consolidate a\nVIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The\nprimary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to\nbe the party that meets both of the following\ncriteria: (i) has the power to make decisions\nthat most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE; and (ii) has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Upon\nconsolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of\nthe VIE\u2019s assets, liabilities and\nnoncontrolling interests on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we\ndetermine whether any changes occurred\nrequiring a reassessment of whether we are the\nprimary beneficiary of an entity.\nSee Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities\nand Variable Interest Entities for information\nabout VIEs that we consolidate as well as\nthose that we do not consolidate but in which\nwe hold a significant variable interest.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe provide servicing under various loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential loans. These contracts are either\npurchased in the open market or retained as\npart of a loan securitization or loan sale.\nAll acquired or originated servicing rights\nare measured at fair value. Fair value is\nbased on the present value of the expected\nfuture net cash flows, including assumptions\nas to:\n\u2022 Deposit balances and interest rates for\nescrow and commercial reserve earnings,\n\u2022 Discount rates,\n\u2022 Estimated prepayment speeds, and\n\u2022 Estimated servicing costs.\nWe measure commercial and residential MSRs at\nfair value in order to reduce any potential\nmeasurement mismatch between our economic\nhedges and the MSRs. We manage the risk by\nhedging the fair value of MSRs with\nderivatives and securities which are expected\nto increase in value when the value of the\nservicing right declines. Changes in the fair\nvalue of MSRs are recognized as\ngains/(losses). The fair value of these\nservicing rights is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model which\ncalculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into\nconsideration actual and expected mortgage\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nSee Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions\nrepresents the value attributable to\nunidentifiable intangible elements in the\nbusiness acquired. At least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events\noccur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date,\nmanagement performs the goodwill impairment\ntest at a reporting unit level.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 113\nPNC may first perform a qualitative analysis\nto evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. If, after\nconsidering all relevant events and\ncircumstances, PNC determines it is not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, then performing a quantitative\nimpairment test is not necessary. If PNC\nelects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or\nconcludes via qualitative analysis that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest is performed. Inputs are generated and\nused in calculating the fair value of the\nreporting unit, which is compared to its\ncarrying amount. The fair value of our\nreporting units is determined by using\ndiscounted cash flows and/or market\ncomparability methodologies. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying amount, an entity should recognize an\nimpairment charge for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of goodwill exceeds the\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value. The loss\nrecognized should not exceed the total amount\nof goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nSee Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\n\nLeases\nLessor Arrangements\nWe provide financing for various types of\nequipment, including aircraft, energy and\npower systems and vehicles through a variety\nof lease arrangements. Finance leases are\ncarried at the aggregate of lease payments\nplus estimated residual value of the leased\nequipment, less unearned income. Leveraged\nleases, a form of financing leases, are\ncarried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize\nincome over the term of the lease using the\nconstant effective yield method. Lease\nresidual values are reviewed for impairment at\nleast annually. Gains or losses on the sale of\nleased assets are included in Other\nnoninterest income. Valuation adjustments on\noperating lease residuals are included in\nOther noninterest expense while valuation\nadjustments on the net investment of a direct\nfinancing or sales-type lease are included in\nProvision for credit losses. Prior to the\nadoption of CECL, valuation adjustments on\nlease residuals were included in Other\nnoninterest expense.\nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office\nspace, land and equipment under operating and\nfinance leases. At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on\nJanuary 1, 2019, we elected the practical\nexpedient to account for the lease and\nnonlease components of existing real estate\nleases and leases of advertising assets, such\nas signage, as a single lease component.\nEffective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease\ncomponents of new lease agreements are\naccounted for separately. Lease components\nconsist of fixed payments including rent, real\nestate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease\ncomponents consist of common-area maintenance\ncosts. In addition, we elected the practical\nexpedient to not apply the recognition\nrequirements under the standard to short-term\nleases. Leases with an initial term of 12\nmonths or less are not recorded on the balance\nsheet, as we recognize lease expense for these\nleases on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Generally, we have elected to use the\nOvernight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to\nthe term of the lease at the lease measurement\ndate as our incremental borrowing rate to\nmeasure the right-of-use-asset and lease\nliability.\nSee Note 7 Leases for additional information\non our leasing arrangements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor financial reporting purposes, we\ndepreciate premises and equipment, net of\nsalvage value, principally using the straight-\nline method over their estimated useful lives.\nWe use estimated useful lives for furniture\nand equipment ranging from oneto 10years, and\ndepreciate buildings over an estimated useful\nlife of up to 40years. We amortize leasehold\nimprovements over their estimated useful lives\nof up to 15years or the respective lease\nterms, whichever is shorter.\nWe purchase, as well as internally develop and\ncustomize, certain software to enhance or\nperform internal business functions. Software\ndevelopment costs incurred in the planning and\npost-development project stages are charged to\nNoninterest expense. Costs associated with\ndesigning software configuration and\ninterfaces, installation, coding programs and\ntesting systems are capitalized and amortized\nusing the straight-line method over periods\nranging from oneto 10years.\nWe review the remaining useful lives and\ncarrying values of premises and equipment to\ndetermine whether an event has occurred that\nwould indicate a change in useful life is\nwarranted or if any impairment exists.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income, on an after-tax\nbasis, primarily consists of unrealized gains\nor losses on debt securities, unrealized gains\nor losses on derivatives designated as cash\nflow hedges, and changes in pension and other\npostretirement benefit plan liability\nadjustments. Details of each component are\nincluded in Note 13 Other Comprehensive\nIncome.\n114 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\nTreasury Stock\nWe record common stock purchased for treasury\nat cost. At the date of subsequent reissue,\nthe treasury stock account is reduced by the\ncost of such stock on the first-in, first-out\nbasis.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated\nusing the two-class method to determine income\nattributable to common shareholders. Unvested\nshare-based payment awards that contain\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents are considered participating\nsecurities under the two-class method.\nDistributed dividends and dividend equivalents\nrelated to participating securities and an\nallocation of undistributed net income to\nparticipating securities reduce the amount of\nincome attributable to common shareholders. In\na period with a loss, no allocation will be\nmade to the participating securities, as they\ndo not have a contractual obligation to absorb\nlosses. Income attributable to common\nshareholders is then divided by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding for the\nperiod.\nDiluted earnings per common share is\ncalculated under the more dilutive of either\nthe treasury method or the two-class method.\nFor the diluted calculation, we increase the\nweighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding by the assumed conversion of\noutstanding convertible preferred stock from\nthe beginning of the year or date of issuance,\nif later, and the number of shares of common\nstock that would be issued assuming the\nexercise of stock options and warrants and the\nissuance of incentive shares using the\ntreasury stock method. These adjustments to\nthe weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding are made only when\nsuch adjustments will dilute earnings per\ncommon share. For periods in which there is a\nloss from continuing operations, any potential\ndilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this\nscenario, no potential dilutive shares will be\nincluded in the continuing operations,\ndiscontinued operations or total earnings per\ncommon share calculations, even if overall net\nincome is reported. See Note 14 Earnings Per\nShare for additional information.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments and\nthe methods and assumptions used in estimating\nfair value amounts and financial assets and\nliabilities for which fair value was elected\nare detailed in Note 15 Fair Value.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to\nboth mitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risks inherent in\nour business activities, as well as to\nfacilitate customer risk management\nactivities. We manage these risks as part of\nour asset and liability management process and\nthrough credit policies and procedures.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments at\nfair value as either Other assets or Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nand the related cash flows in the Operating\nActivities section of the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for\ncounterparty credit risk are included in the\ndetermination of fair value. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative\ninstrument depends on whether it has been\ndesignated and qualifies as part of a cash\nflow or net investment hedging relationship.\nFor all other derivatives, changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in earnings.\nWe utilize a net presentation for derivative\ninstruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ntaking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash collateral exchanged with counterparties\nis also netted against the applicable\nderivative exposures by offsetting obligations\nto return, or general rights to reclaim, cash\ncollateral against the fair values of the net\nderivatives being collateralized.\nFor those derivative instruments that are\ndesignated and qualify as accounting hedges,\nwe designate the hedging instrument, based on\nthe exposure being hedged, as a fair value\nhedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net\ninvestment in a foreign operation.\nWe formally document the relationship between\nthe hedging instruments and hedged items, as\nwell as the risk management objective and\nstrategy, before undertaking an accounting\nhedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the\nderivatives and related hedged items must be\ndesignated as a hedge at inception of the\nhedge relationship. In addition, a derivative\nmust be highly effective at reducing the risk\nassociated with the exposure being hedged. For\naccounting hedge relationships, we formally\nassess, both at the inception of the hedge and\non an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are\nhighly effective in offsetting designated\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item. If it is determined that the\nderivative instrument is not highly effective,\nhedge accounting is discontinued. We assess\neffectiveness using statistical regression\nanalysis. Where the critical terms of the\nderivative and hedged item match,\neffectiveness may be assessed qualitatively.\nFor derivatives that are designated as fair\nvalue hedges ( i.e ., hedging the exposure to\nchanges in the fair value of an asset or a\nliability attributable to a particular risk,\nsuch as changes in LIBOR), changes in the fair\nvalue of the hedging instrument are recognized\nin earnings and offset by also recognizing in\nearnings the changes in the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\nTo\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 115\nthe extent the change in fair value of the\nderivative does not offset the change in fair\nvalue of the hedged item, the difference is\nreflected in the Consolidated Income Statement\nin the same income statement line as the\nhedged item.\n\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges\n( i.e ., hedging the exposure to variability\nin expected future cash flows), the gain or\nloss on derivatives is reported as a component\nof AOCI and subsequently reclassified to\nincome in the same period or periods during\nwhich the hedged cash flows affect earnings\nand recorded in the same income statement line\nitem as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives\ndesignated as a hedge of net investment in a\nforeign operation, the gain or loss on the\nderivatives is reported as a component of\nAOCI.\n\nWe discontinue hedge accounting when it is\ndetermined that the derivative no longer\nqualifies as an effective hedge; the\nderivative expires or is sold, terminated or\nexercised; or the derivative is de-designated\nas a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a\ncash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that\nthe forecasted transaction will occur by the\nend of the originally specified time period.\n\nWe purchase or originate financial instruments\nthat contain an embedded derivative. For\nfinancial instruments not measured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings, we assess, at inception of the\ntransaction, if the economic characteristics\nof the embedded derivative are clearly and\nclosely related to the economic\ncharacteristics of the host contract, and\nwhether a separate instrument with the same\nterms as the embedded derivative would be a\nderivative. If the embedded derivative is not\nclearly and closely related to the host\ncontract and meets the definition of a\nderivative, the embedded derivative is\nrecorded separately from the host contract\nwith changes in fair value recorded in\nearnings, unless we elect to account for the\nhybrid instrument at fair value.\n\nWe enter into commitments to originate\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans for\nsale. We also enter into commitments to\npurchase or sell commercial and residential\nreal estate loans. These commitments are\naccounted for as free-standing derivatives\nwhich are recorded at fair value in Other\nassets or Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss\nfrom the change in fair value after the\ninception of the commitment is recognized in\nNoninterest income.\n\nSee Note 16 Financial Derivatives for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset\nand liability method. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities and\nare measured using the enacted tax rates and\nlaws that we expect will apply at the time\nwhen we believe the differences will reverse.\nChanges in tax rates and tax law are accounted\nfor in the period of enactment. Thus, at the\nenactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured\nand the change is recognized in Income Tax\nexpense. The recognition of deferred tax\nassets requires an assessment to determine the\nrealization of such assets. Realization refers\nto the incremental benefit achieved through\nthe reduction in future taxes payable or\nrefunds receivable from the deferred tax\nassets, assuming that the underlying\ndeductible differences and carryforwards are\nthe last items to enter into the determination\nof future taxable income. We establish a\nvaluation allowance for tax assets when it is\nmore likely than not that they will not be\nrealized, based upon all available positive\nand negative evidence.\nWe use the deferral method of accounting on\ninvestments that generate investment tax\ncredits. Under this method, the investment tax\ncredits are recognized as a reduction to the\nrelated asset.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn interest and noninterest income from\nvarious sources, including:\n\u2022 Lending,\n\u2022 Securities portfolio,\n\u2022 Asset management,\n\u2022 Loan sales, loan securitizations, and\nservicing,\n\u2022 Brokerage services,\n\u2022 Sale of loans and securities,\n\u2022 Certain private equity activities, and\n\u2022 Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange\nactivities.\nIn addition, we earn fees and commissions\nfrom:\n\u2022 Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of\ncredit and financial guarantees,\n\u2022 Deposit account services,\n\u2022 Merchant services,\n\u2022 Selling various insurance products,\n\u2022 Providing treasury management services,\n\u2022 Providing merger and acquisition advisory\nand related services,\n\u2022 Debit and credit card transactions, and\n\u2022 Participating in certain capital markets\ntransactions.\n116 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nService charges on deposit accounts are\nrecognized when earned. Brokerage fees and\ngains and losses on the sale of securities and\ncertain derivatives are recognized on a trade-\ndate basis.\n\nWe record private equity income or loss based\non changes in the valuation of the underlying\ninvestments or when we dispose of our\ninterest.\n\nWe recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the\nfair value of certain financial instruments\nwhere we have elected the fair value option.\nThese financial instruments include certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans\noriginated for sale, certain residential\nmortgage portfolio loans and resale\nagreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on\nchanges in the fair value of residential and\ncommercial MSRs.\n\nWe recognize revenue from servicing\nresidential mortgages, commercial mortgages\nand other consumer loans for others as earned\nbased on the specific contractual terms. These\nrevenues are reported on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement in the line items Residential\nmortgage, Corporate services and Consumer\nservices. We recognize revenue from\nsecurities, derivatives and foreign exchange\ncustomer-related trading, as well as\nsecurities underwriting activities, as these\ntransactions occur or as services are\nprovided. We generally recognize gains from\nthe sale of loans upon meeting the\nderecognition criteria for transfers of\nfinancial assets. Mortgage revenue recognized\nis reported net of mortgage repurchase\nreserves.\n\nFor the fee-based revenue within the scope of\nASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers , revenue is recognized when or as\nthose services are transferred to the\ncustomer. See Note 24 Fee-Based Revenue from\nContracts with Customers for additional\ninformation related to revenue within the\nscope of ASC 606.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  2                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  A CQUISITION A ND D IVESTITURE A CTIVITY    \n                                              \nPending Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares,\nInc.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, we announced a\ndefinitive agreement with BBVA, S.A. to\nacquire BBVA including its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA, for a fixed purchase\nprice of $ 11.6billion in cash.\n\nBBVA USA has over 600 branches in Texas,\nAlabama, Arizona, California, Florida,\nColorado and New Mexico. The transaction is\nexpected to add approximately $ 102billion in\ntotal assets, $ 86billion of deposits and $\n66billion of loans to PNC\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet and to close in mid-2021,\nsubject to customary closing conditions,\nincluding receipt of regulatory approvals.\n\nSale of Equity Investment in Blackrock, Inc.\n\nIn May 2020, PNC completed the sale of its\n31.6million shares of BlackRock, Inc., common\nand preferred stock through a registered\nsecondary offering at a price of $ 420per\nshare. In addition, BlackRock repurchased\n2.65million shares from PNC at a price of $\n414.96per share. The total proceeds from the\nsale were $ 14.2billion in cash, net of $\n0.2billion in expenses, and resulted in a gain\non sale of $ 4.3billion. Additionally, PNC\ncontributed 500,000BlackRock shares to the PNC\nFoundation.\n\nFollowing the sale and donation, PNC has\ndivested its entire investment in BlackRock\nand only holds shares of

During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, pursuant to the\nguidance in ASU 2020-04, we elected to\ntransfer debt securities with an amortized\ncost of $ 49million and a fair value of $\n48million from the held to maturity to the\navailable for sale portfolio.\n\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional\ninformation related to the adoption of the\nCECL standard, including the methodologies\n\nused to determine the allowance for investment\nsecurities, and the adoption of ASU 2019-04\nand ASU 2020-04.\n\n118 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table summarizes our available\nfor sale and held to maturity portfolios by\nmajor security type:\n\nTable 41: Investment Securities Summary\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) The accrued interest associated with our\navailable for sale and held to maturity\nportfolios totaled $ 238million and $ 5million\nat December 31, 2020, respectively.

As of December 31, 2020, 85% of\nour securities held to maturity were rated\nAAA/AA.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Shareholders\u2019 equity as\nAOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at December 31, 2020\nincluded $ 0.2billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for December 31, 2019\nwas $ 0.5billion.\n\nTable 42 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities as of December 31,\n2020.

Pursuant to the\ninteragency guidance issued in April 2020 and\nin connection with the credit reporting rules\nfrom the CARES Act, the December 31, 2020\ndelinquency status of loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships aligns with the\nrules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of December 31, 2020\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period. Loan modifications due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships that permanently\nreduce either the contractual interest rate or\nthe principal balance of a loan do not qualify\nfor TDR relief under the CARES Act or the\ninteragency guidance.\n\n122 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\nTable 47: Analysis of Loan Portfolio\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table represent loans held for\ninvestment and do not include any associated\nvaluation allowance.\n(b) The accrued interest associated with our\nloan portfolio at December 31, 2020 totaled $\n0.7billion and is included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed Residential real estate\nloans and Education loans totaling $\n0.4billion and $ 0.2billion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n(d) Consumer loans accounted for under the\nfair value option for which we do not expect\nto collect substantially all principal and\ninterest are subject to nonaccrual accounting\nand classification upon meeting any of our\nnonaccrual policies.

Possible product features that\nmay create a concentration of credit risk\nwould\n\ninclude a high original or updated LTV ratio,\nterms that may expose the borrower to future\nincreases in repayments\n\nabove increases in market interest rates, and\ninterest-only loans, among others.\n\nWe originate interest-only loans to commercial\nborrowers. Such credit arrangements are\nusually designed to match borrower cash flow\n\nexpectations (e.g., working capital lines,\nrevolvers). These products are standard in the\nfinancial services industry and product\nfeatures are considered during the\nunderwriting process to mitigate the increased\nrisk that the interest-only feature may result\nin borrowers not\n\nbeing able to make interest and principal\npayments when due. We do not believe that\nthese product features create a concentration\nof\n\ncredit risk.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, we pledged $ 30.1billion\nof commercial loans to the Federal Reserve\nBank and $ 69.0billion of residential real\nestate and other loans to the Federal Home\nLoan Bank as collateral for the ability to\nborrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts\nat December 31, 2019 were $ 16.9billion and $\n68.0billion, respectively. Amounts pledged\nreflect the unpaid principal balances.\n\nNonperforming Assets\n\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming\nloans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets.\nNonperforming loans are those loans accounted\nfor at amortized cost whose credit quality has\ndeteriorated to the extent that full\ncollection of contractual principal and\ninterest is not probable. Interest income is\nnot recognized on these loans. Loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option are reported\nas performing loans, however, when nonaccrual\ncriteria is met interest income is not\nrecognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.\n\nWith the adoption of the CECL standard,\nnonperforming loans as of December 31, 2020\ninclude PCD loans. Amounts as of December 31,\n2019 excluded purchased impaired loans as we\nwere accreting interest income over the\nexpected life of the loans.

To\nevaluate the level of credit risk, we assign\nan internal risk rating reflecting the\nborrower\u2019s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional\ncredit risk rating methodology provides\ngranularity in the risk monitoring process.\nThese ratings\n\n124 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nare reviewed and updated, generally at least\nonce per year. For small balance homogeneous\npools of commercial and industrial loans and\nleases, we apply scoring techniques to assist\nin determining the PD. The combination of the\nPD and LGD ratings assigned to commercial and\nindustrial loans, capturing both the\ncombination of expectations of default and\nloss severity in the event of default,\nreflects credit quality characteristics as of\nthe reporting date and are used as inputs into\nour loss forecasting process.\n\nBased upon the amount of the lending\narrangement and our risk rating assessment, we\nfollow a formal schedule of written periodic\nreviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews\nof a market\u2019s or business unit\u2019s loan\nportfolio, focusing on those loans which we\nperceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs\nand LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is\nweakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our\npractice to review any customer obligation and\nits level of credit risk more frequently. We\nattempt to proactively manage our loans by\nusing various procedures that are customized\nto the risk of a given loan, including ongoing\noutreach, contact, and assessment of obligor\nfinancial conditions, collateral inspection\nand appraisal.\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate projects and commercial\nmortgages similar to commercial and industrial\nloans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks\nassociated with commercial real estate\nprojects and commercial mortgage activities\ntend to be correlated to the loan structure\nand collateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. As a result, these\nattributes are also monitored and utilized in\nassessing credit risk.\n\nAs with the commercial and industrial loan\nclass, a formal schedule of periodic reviews\nis also performed to assess market/geographic\nrisk and business unit/industry risk. Often as\na result of these overviews, more in-depth\nreviews and increased scrutiny are placed on\nareas of higher risk, such as adverse changes\nin risk ratings, deteriorating operating\ntrends, and/or areas that concern management.\nThese reviews are designed to assess risk and\nfacilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\n\nEquipment Lease Financing\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\nequipment lease financing loan class similar\nto commercial and industrial loans by\nanalyzing PD and LGD.\n\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and\nthe level of credit risk, we follow a formal\nschedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this\noccurs quarterly, although we have established\npractices to review such credit risk more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant. Our\nreview process entails analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual\nvalue, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk,\nindustry risk, guarantor requirements, and\nregulatory compliance as applicable.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 125\nTable 49: Commercial Credit Quality Indicators\n(a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Dece\u2026                                       \n  31,                                         \n  2019                                        \n  - In         Pass                    Total  \n  mill\u2026       Rated       Criti\u2026       Loans  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and      $  119,\u2026    $   5,576    $  125,\u2026  \n  indu\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  real        27,4\u2026          686       28,1\u2026  \n  esta\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  lease       6,891          264       7,155  \n  fina\u2026                                       \n  Total    $  154,\u2026    $   6,526    $  160,\u2026  \n  comm\u2026                                       \n                                              \n(a) Loans in our commercial portfolio are\nclassified as Pass Rated or Criticized based\non the regulatory definitions, which are\ndriven by the PD and LGD ratings that we\nassign. The Criticized classification includes\nloans that were rated special mention,\nsubstandard or doubtful as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019.\nHome Equity and Residential Real Estate\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators,\nincluding delinquency information,\nnonperforming loan information, updated credit\nscores, originated and updated LTV ratios, to\nmonitor and manage credit risk within the home\nequity and residential real estate loan\nclasses. A summary of credit quality\nindicators follows:\n\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor\ntrending of delinquency/delinquency rates for\nhome equity and residential real estate loans.\nSee Table 47 for additional information.\n\nNonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of\nnonperforming loans for home equity and\nresidential real estate loans. See Table 47\nfor additional information.\n\nCredit Scores: We use a national third-party\nprovider to update FICO credit scores for home\nequity and residential real estate loans at\nleast quarterly. The updated scores are\nincorporated into a series of credit\nmanagement reports, which are utilized to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and\nsubordinate lien positions): At least\nquarterly, we update the property values of\nreal estate collateral and calculate an\nupdated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines\nsecured by real estate in regions experiencing\nsignificant declines in property values, more\nfrequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV\nmigration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nWe use a combination of original LTV and\nupdated LTV for internal risk management and\nreporting purposes ( e.g. , line management,\nloss mitigation strategies). In addition to\nthe fact that estimated property values by\ntheir nature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that\nupdated LTVs may be based upon management\u2019s\nassumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider,\nHPI changes will be incorporated in arriving\nat management\u2019s estimate of updated LTV).\n\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled\nproperty values. The related estimates and\ninputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation\nmodels, broker price opinions, HPI indices,\nproperty location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and\nmanagement assumptions.

For all loan types, we\ngenerally use a combination of internal loan\nparameters as well as an updated FICO score.\nWe use FICO scores as a primary credit quality\nindicator for automobile and credit card\nloans, as well as non-government guaranteed or\nnon-insured education loans and other secured\nand unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit\nmetrics, such as delinquency status, are\nheavily relied upon as credit quality\nindicators for government guaranteed or\ninsured education loans and consumer loans to\nhigh net worth individuals, as internal credit\nmetrics are more relevant than FICO scores for\nthese types of loans.\n\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency\ntrends and losses for each class, FICO credit\nscore updates are obtained at least quarterly\nalong with a variety of credit bureau\nattributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend\nto have a lower likelihood of loss.\nConversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to\nhave a higher likelihood of loss.\n\n128 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the automobile, credit card,\neducation and other consumer loan classes:\n\nTable 51: Credit Quality Indicators for\nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer Loan Classes\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  -

Loans that have been\nrestructured for COVID-19 related hardships\nand meet certain criteria under the CARES Act\nare not categorized as TDRs. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies for additional information\nrelated to TDRs.\n\nTable 52 quantifies the number of loans that\nwere classified as TDRs as well as the change\nin the loans\u2019 balance as a result of becoming\na TDR during 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAdditionally, the table provides information\nabout the types of TDR concessions. The\nPrincipal Forgiveness TDR category includes\nprincipal forgiveness and accrued interest\nforgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category\nincludes reduced interest rate and interest\ndeferral. The Other TDR category primarily\nincludes consumer borrowers that have been\ndischarged from personal liability through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally\nreaffirmed their loan obligations to us, as\nwell as postponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and contractual extensions for\nboth consumer and commercial borrowers.\n\nIn some cases, there have been multiple\nconcessions granted on one loan. This is most\ncommon within the commercial loan portfolio.\nWhen there have been multiple concessions\ngranted in the commercial loan portfolio, the\nprincipal forgiveness concession was\nprioritized for purposes of determining the\ninclusion in Table 52. Second in priority\nwould be rate reduction. In the event that\nmultiple concessions are granted on a consumer\nloan, concessions resulting from discharge\nfrom personal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy without formal affirmation of the\nloan obligations to us would be prioritized\nand included in the Other type of concession\nin Table 52. After that, consumer loan\nconcessions would follow the previously\ndiscussed priority of concessions for the\ncommercial loan portfolio.\nTable 52: Financial Impact and TDRs by\nConcession Type\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date\nare included in this table.\n(b) Represents the amortized cost basis of the\nloans as of the quarter end prior to TDR\ndesignation.\n(c) Represents the amortized cost basis of the\nTDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the\nTDR occurs.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(d) Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date\nare included in this table.\n(e) Represents the recorded investment of the\nloans as of the quarter end prior to TDR\ndesignation, and excludes immaterial amounts\nof accrued interest receivable.\n(f) Represents the recorded investment of the\nTDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the\nTDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of\naccrued interest receivable.\n\nAfter a loan is determined to be a TDR, we\ncontinue to track its performance under its\nmost recent restructured terms.

These transfers have occurred\nthrough Agency securitization, Non-agency\nsecuritization, and loan sale transactions.\nAgency securitizations consist of\nsecuritization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC\nand GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA\nand FHLMC generally securitize our transferred\nloans into mortgage-backed securities for sale\ninto the secondary market through SPEs that\nthey sponsor. As an authorized GNMA\nissuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of\nVA insured loans into mortgage-backed\nsecurities for sale into the secondary market.\nIn Non-agency securitizations, we have\ntransferred loans into securitization SPEs. In\nother instances, third-party investors have\nalso purchased our loans in loan sale\ntransactions and in certain instances have\nsubsequently sold these loans into\nsecuritization SPEs. Securitization SPEs\nutilized in the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization transactions are VIEs.\n\nOur continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC,\nand GNMA securitizations, Non-agency\nsecuritizations, and loan sale transactions\ngenerally consists of servicing, repurchasing\npreviously transferred loans under certain\nconditions and loss share arrangements, and,\nin limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the securitization\nSPEs.\n\nDepending on the transaction, we may act as\nthe master, primary and/or special servicer to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors. Servicing responsibilities\ntypically consist of collecting and remitting\nmonthly borrower principal and interest\npayments, maintaining escrow deposits,\nperforming loss mitigation and foreclosure\nactivities, and, in certain instances, funding\nof servicing advances. Servicing advances,\nwhich are generally reimbursable, are made for\nprincipal and interest and collateral\nprotection and are carried in Other assets at\ncost.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 6 Goodwill and\nMortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair\nValue for further discussion of our servicing\nrights.\n\nCertain loans transferred to the Agencies\ncontain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an\noption to repurchase at par individual\ndelinquent loans that meet certain criteria.\nIn other limited cases, GNMA has granted us\nthe right to repurchase current loans when we\nintend to modify the borrower\u2019s interest rate\nunder established guidelines. When we have the\nunilateral ability to repurchase a loan,\neffective control over the loan has been\nregained and we recognize an asset (in either\nLoans or Loans held for sale) and a\ncorresponding liability (in Other borrowed\nfunds) on the balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan.\n\nThe Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the securitization SPEs\nthat are purchased and held on our balance\nsheet are typically purchased in the secondary\nmarket. We do not retain any credit risk on\nour Agency mortgage-backed security positions\nas FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for\nGNMA) guarantee losses of principal and\ninterest.\n\nWe also have involvement with certain Agency\nand Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs\nwhere we have not transferred commercial\nmortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by\nindependent third-parties and the loans held\nby these entities were purchased exclusively\nfrom other third-parties. Generally, our\ninvolvement with these SPEs is as servicer\nwith servicing activities consistent with\nthose described above.\n\nWe recognize a liability for our loss exposure\nassociated with contractual obligations to\nrepurchase previously transferred loans due to\npossible breaches of representations and\nwarranties and also for loss sharing\narrangements (recourse obligations) with the\nAgencies.

In performing these\nassessments, we evaluate our level of\ncontinuing involvement in these transactions\nas the nature of our involvement ultimately\ndetermines whether or not we hold a variable\ninterest and/or are the primary beneficiary of\nthe SPE. Factors we consider in our\nconsolidation assessment include the\nsignificance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii)\nour holdings of mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the\nrights of third-party variable interest\nholders.\n\nThe first step in our assessment is to\ndetermine whether we hold a variable interest\nin the securitization SPE. We hold variable\ninterests in Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs through our holding of\nresidential and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the SPEs and/or our\nrecourse obligations. Each SPE in which we\nhold a variable interest is evaluated to\ndetermine whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of the entity. For Agency\nsecuritization transactions, our contractual\nrole as servicer does not give us the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly\naffect the economic performance of the SPEs.\nThus, we are not the primary beneficiary of\nthese entities. For Non-agency securitization\ntransactions, we would be the primary\nbeneficiary to the extent our servicing\nactivities give us the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the SPE and we hold a\nmore than insignificant variable interest in\nthe entity.\n\nDetails about the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs where we hold a variable\ninterest and are not the primary beneficiary\nare included in Table 58. Our maximum exposure\nto loss as a result of our involvement with\nthese SPEs is the carrying value of the\nmortgage-backed securities, servicing assets,\nservicing advances and our liabilities\nassociated with our recourse obligations.\nCreditors of the securitization SPEs have no\nrecourse to our assets or general credit.\n\nTax Credit Investments and Other\n\nFor tax credit investments in which we do not\nhave the right to make decisions that will\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the entity, we are not the\nprimary beneficiary and thus do not\nconsolidate the entity. These investments are\ndisclosed in Table 58. The table also reflects\nour maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any\npotential tax credit recapture. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is equal to our legally\nbinding equity commitments adjusted for\nrecorded impairment, partnership results or\namortization for qualifying low income housing\ntax credit investments when applicable. For\nall legally binding unfunded equity\ncommitments, we increase our recognized\ninvestment and recognize a liability. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, we had a liability for\nunfunded commitments of $ 1.1billion related\nto investments in qualified affordable housing\nprojects which is reflected in Other\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTable 58 also includes our involvement in\nlease financing transactions with LLCs engaged\nin solar power generation that, to a large\nextent, provided returns in the form of tax\ncredits. The outstanding financings and\noperating lease assets are reflected as Loans\nand Other assets, respectively, on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, whereas related\nliabilities are reported in Deposits and Other\nliabilities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 135\nWe make certain equity investments in various\ntax credit limited partnerships or LLCs.

MSRs are purchased or\noriginated when loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 1.2billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and $ 1.6billion at December\n31, 2019, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages measured at fair value.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nWe recognize gains/(losses) on changes in the\nfair value of commercial MSRs.

The expected and actual\nrates of mortgage loan prepayments are\nsignificant factors driving the fair value.\nManagement uses both internal proprietary\nmodels and a third-party model to estimate\nfuture commercial mortgage loan prepayments\nand a third-party model to estimate future\nresidential mortgage loan prepayments. These\nmodels have been refined based on current\nmarket conditions and management judgment.\nFuture interest rates are another important\nfactor in the valuation of MSRs. Management\nutilizes market implied forward interest rates\nto estimate the future direction of mortgage\nand discount rates. The forward rates utilized\nare derived from the current yield curve for\nU.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are\nconsistent with pricing of capital markets\ninstruments. Changes in the shape and slope of\nthe forward curve in future periods may result\nin volatility in the fair value estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 62 and 63. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 137\nThe

Our leases have remaining\nlease terms of one yearto 47years, some of\nwhich may include options to renew the leases\nfor up to 99years, and some of which may\ninclude options to terminate the leases prior\nto the end date. Certain leases also include\noptions to purchase the leased asset. The\nexercise of lease renewal, termination and\npurchase options is at our sole discretion.\n\nWe recognize on the balance sheet all leases\nwith lease terms greater than twelve months as\na lease liability with a corresponding right-\nof-use asset. At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on\nJanuary 1, 2019, we elected the practical\nexpedient to account for the lease and\nnonlease components of existing real estate\nleases and leases of advertising assets, such\nas signage, as a single lease component.\nEffective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease\ncomponents of new lease agreements are\naccounted for separately. Lease components\nconsist of fixed payments including rent, real\nestate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease\ncomponents consist of common-area maintenance\ncosts. In addition, we elected the practical\nexpedient to not apply the recognition\nrequirements under the standard to short-term\nleases. Leases with an initial term of 12\nmonths or less are not recorded on the balance\nsheet, as we recognize lease expense for these\nleases on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Generally, we have elected to use the\nOvernight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to\nthe term of the lease at the lease measurement\ndate as our incremental borrowing rate to\nmeasure the right-of-use asset and lease\nliability.\n\nCertain of our lease agreements include rental\npayments based on a percentage of revenue and\nothers include rental payments if certain bank\ndeposit levels are met. Our lease agreements\ndo not contain any material residual value\nguarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nSubleases to third parties were not material\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n The PNC

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate, and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. The three\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\n\u2022 Level 1: Fair value is determined using a\nquoted price in an active market for identical\nassets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and\nliabilities may include debt securities,\nequity securities and listed derivative\ncontracts that are traded in an active\nexchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that are actively traded in over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\n\u2022 Level 2: Fair value is estimated using\ninputs other than quoted prices included\nwithin Level 1 that are observable for assets\nor liabilities, either directly or indirectly.\nThe majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities\ninclude debt securities and listed derivative\ncontracts with quoted prices that are traded\nin markets that are not active, and certain\ndebt and equity securities and over-the-\ncounter derivative contracts whose fair value\nis determined using a pricing model without\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\n\u2022 Level 3: Fair value is estimated using\nunobservable inputs that are significant to\nthe fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities include\nfinancial instruments whose value is\ndetermined using pricing models and discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or similar techniques\nfor which the significant valuation inputs are\nnot observable and the determination of fair\nvalue requires significant management judgment\nor estimation.\n\nWe characterize active markets as those where\ntransaction volumes are sufficient to provide\nobjective pricing information, with reasonably\nnarrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer\nquotes received do not vary widely and are\nbased on current information. Inactive markets\nare typically characterized by low transaction\nvolumes, price quotations that vary\nsubstantially among market participants or are\nnot based on current information, wide bid/ask\nspreads, a significant increase in implied\nliquidity risk premiums, yields, or\nperformance indicators for observed\ntransactions or quoted prices compared to\nhistorical periods, a significant decline or\nabsence of a market for new issuance, or any\ncombination of the above factors. We also\nconsider nonperformance risks, including\ncredit risk, as part of our valuation\nmethodology for all assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value,\nby their nature, result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Assets and\nliabilities classified within Level 3\ninherently require the use of various\nassumptions, estimates and judgments when\nmeasuring their fair value. As observable\nmarket activity is commonly not available to\nuse when estimating the fair value of Level 3\nassets and liabilities, we must estimate fair\nvalue using various modeling techniques. These\ntechniques include the use of a variety of\ninputs/assumptions including credit quality,\nliquidity, interest rates or other relevant\ninputs across the entire population of our\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the\nsignificant underlying factors or assumptions\n(either an increase or a decrease) in any of\nthese areas underlying our estimates may have\nresulted in a significant increase/decrease in\nthe Level 3 fair value measurement of a\nparticular asset and/or liability from period\nto period.\n\nAny models used to determine fair values or to\nvalidate dealer quotes are subject to review\nand independent testing as part of our model\nvalidation and internal control testing\nprocesses. Our Model Risk Management Group\nreviews significant models on at least an\nannual basis. In addition, the Valuation\nCommittee approves valuation methodologies and\nreviews the results of independent valuation\nreviews and processes for assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain residential mortgage\nloans originated for sale at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. The election of the fair\nvalue option aligns the accounting for the\nresidential mortgages with the related hedges.\nResidential mortgage loans are valued based on\nquoted market prices, where available, prices\nfor other traded mortgage loans with similar\ncharacteristics, and purchase commitments and\nbid information received from market\nparticipants. The prices are adjusted as\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain loans that are priced based on the\npricing of similar loans. These adjustments\nrepresent unobservable inputs to the valuation\nbut are not considered significant given the\nrelative insensitivity of the value to changes\nin these inputs to the fair value of the\nloans. Accordingly, the majority of\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale are\nclassified as Level 2.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage\nloans classified as held for sale in whole\nloan transactions at fair value. We determine\nthe fair value of commercial mortgage loans\nheld for sale based upon discounted cash\nflows. Fair value is determined using sale\nvaluation assumptions that management believes\na market participant would use in pricing the\nloans.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 147\nValuation assumptions may include observable\ninputs based on the benchmark interest rate\nswap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales\ntransactions. The significant unobservable\ninput for commercial mortgage loans held for\nsale, excluding those to be sold to agencies,\nis management\u2019s assumption of the spread\napplied to the benchmark rate. The spread over\nthe benchmark curve includes management\u2019s\nassumptions of the impact of credit and\nliquidity risk. Significant increases\n(decreases) in the spread applied to the\nbenchmark would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower (higher) asset value. The\nwide range of the spread over the benchmark\ncurve is due to the varying risk and\nunderlying property characteristics within our\nportfolio. Based on the significance of the\nunobservable input we classified this\nportfolio as Level 3.\n\nFor loans to be sold to agencies with\nservicing retained, the fair value is adjusted\nfor the estimated servicing cash flows, which\nis an unobservable input. This adjustment is\nnot considered significant given the relative\ninsensitivity of the value to changes in the\ninput to the fair value of the loans.\nAccordingly, commercial mortgage loans held\nfor sale to agencies are classified as Level\n2.\n\nSecurities Available for Sale and Trading\nSecurities\n\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available for sale and trading\nportfolios. We primarily use prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes or recent\ntrades to determine the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of securities were\npriced by third-party vendors. The third-party\nvendors use a variety of methods when pricing\nsecurities that incorporate relevant market\ndata to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer\nin the marketplace would pay for a security\nunder current market conditions. We monitor\nand validate the reliability of vendor pricing\non an ongoing basis through pricing\nmethodology reviews, including detailed\nreviews of the assumptions and inputs used by\nthe vendor to price individual securities, and\nthrough price validation testing. Securities\nnot priced by one of our pricing vendors may\nbe valued using a dealer quote, which are also\nsubject to price validation testing. Price\nvalidation testing is performed independent of\nthe risk-taking function and involves\ncorroborating the prices received from third-\nparty vendors and dealers with prices from\nanother third party or through other sources,\nsuch as internal valuations or sales of\nsimilar securities. Security prices are also\nvalidated through actual cash settlement upon\nsale of a security.\n\nSecurities are classified within the fair\nvalue hierarchy after giving consideration to\nthe activity level in the market for the\nsecurity type and the observability of the\ninputs used to determine the fair value. When\na quoted price in an active market exists for\nthe identical security, this price is used to\ndetermine fair value and the security is\nclassified within Level 1 of the hierarchy.\nLevel 1 securities include U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\n\nWhen a quoted price in an active market for\nthe identical security is not available, fair\nvalue is estimated using either an alternative\nmarket approach, such as a recent trade or\nmatrix pricing, or an income approach, such as\na discounted cash flow pricing model. If the\ninputs to the valuation are based primarily on\nmarket observable information, then the\nsecurity is classified within Level 2 of the\nhierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency\ndebt securities, agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, agency and non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, certain\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities, asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by non-mortgage-related\ncorporate and consumer loans, and other debt\nsecurities. Level 2 securities are\npredominantly priced by third parties, either\nby a pricing vendor or dealer.\n\nIn certain cases where there is limited\nactivity or less transparency around the\ninputs to the valuation, securities are\nclassified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nSecurities classified as Level 3 consist\nprimarily of non-agency residential mortgage-\nbacked and asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by first- and second-lien\nresidential mortgage loans. Fair value for\nthese securities is primarily estimated using\npricing obtained from third-party vendors. In\nsome cases, fair value is estimated using a\ndealer quote, by reference to prices of\nsecurities of a similar vintage and collateral\ntype or by reference to recent sales of\nsimilar securities. Market activity for these\nsecurity types is limited with little price\ntransparency. As a result, these securities\nare generally valued by the third-party vendor\nusing a discounted cash flow approach that\nincorporates significant unobservable inputs\nand observable market activity where\navailable. Significant inputs to the valuation\ninclude prepayment projections and credit loss\nassumptions (default rate and loss severity)\nand discount rates that are deemed\nrepresentative of current market conditions.\nSignificant increases (decreases) in any of\nthose assumptions in isolation would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nCertain infrequently traded debt securities\nwithin Other debt securities available for\nsale and Trading securities are also\nclassified in Level 3 and are included in the\nInsignificant Level 3 assets, net of\nliabilities line item in Table 85. The\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to\nestimate the fair value of these securities\ninclude an estimate of expected credit losses\nand a discount for liquidity risk. These\ninputs are incorporated into the fair value\nmeasurement by either increasing the spread\nover the benchmark curve or by applying a\ncredit and liquidity discount to the par value\nof the security. Significant increases\n(decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk\ncould have resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value estimate.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans accounted for at fair value consist\nprimarily of residential mortgage loans. These\nloans are generally valued similarly to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale and\nare classified as Level 2. However, similar to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale, if\nthese loans are repurchased and unsalable,\nthey are classified as Level 3. In addition,\nrepurchased VA loans, where only a portion of\nthe principal will be reimbursed, are\nclassified as Level 3. The fair value is\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation based on our historical loss rate.\nWe have elected to account for certain home\nequity lines of credit at fair value. These\nloans are classified as\n\n148 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nLevel 3. Significant inputs to the valuation\nof these loans include credit and liquidity\ndiscount, cumulative default rate, loss\nseverity and gross discount rate and are\ndeemed representative of current market\nconditions. Significant increases (decreases)\nin any of these assumptions would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments includes money market\nmutual funds as well as direct and indirect\nprivate equity investments. Money market\nmutual funds are valued based on quoted prices\nin active markets for identical securities and\nclassified within Level 1 of the hierarchy.\nThe valuation of direct and indirect private\nequity investments requires significant\nmanagement judgment due to the absence of\nquoted market prices, inherent lack of\nliquidity and the long-term nature of such\ninvestments. Various valuation techniques are\nused for direct investments, including\nmultiples of adjusted earnings of the entity,\nindependent appraisals, anticipated financing\nand sale transactions with third parties, or\nthe pricing used to value the entity in a\nrecent financing transaction. A multiple of\nadjusted earnings calculation is the valuation\ntechnique utilized most frequently and is the\nmost significant unobservable input used in\nsuch calculation. Significant decreases\n(increases) in the multiple of earnings could\nhave resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement. Direct equity\ninvestments are classified as Level 3.\n\nIndirect investments are not redeemable;\nhowever, we receive distributions over the\nlife of the partnerships from liquidation of\nthe underlying investments by the investee,\nwhich we expect to occur over the next\n10years. We value indirect investments in\nprivate equity funds using the net asset value\n(NAV) practical expedient as provided in the\nfinancial statements that we receive from fund\nmanagers. Due to the time lag in our receipt\nof the financial information and based on a\nreview of investments and valuation techniques\napplied, adjustments to the manager-provided\nvalue are made when available recent portfolio\ncompany information or market information\nindicates a significant change in value from\nthat provided by the manager of the fund.\nIndirect investments valued using NAV are not\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\n\nMSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs\nvaluation model reflect management\u2019s best\nestimate of factors that a market participant\nwould use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales\nof MSRs do occur and can offer some market\ninsight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open\nmarket with readily observable prices so the\nprecise terms and conditions of sales are not\navailable.\n\nResidential MSRs\n\nAs a benchmark for the reasonableness of our\nresidential MSRs fair value, we obtained\nopinions of value from independent brokers.\nThese brokers provided a range (+/- 10bps)\nbased upon their own discounted cash flow\ncalculations of our portfolio that reflect\nconditions in the secondary market and any\nrecently executed servicing transactions. We\ncompare our internally-developed residential\nMSRs value to the ranges of values received\nfrom the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair\nvalue falls outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges,\nmanagement will assess whether a valuation\nadjustment is warranted. For the periods\npresented, our residential MSRs value did not\nfall outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges. We\nconsider our residential MSRs value to\nrepresent a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n\nDue to the nature of the unobservable\nvaluation inputs, residential MSRs are\nclassified as Level 3. The significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of residential MSRs are constant\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve. Significant increases (decreases) in\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve would have resulted in lower (higher)\nfair market value of residential MSRs.\n\nCommercial MSRs\n\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated\nby using a discounted cash flow model\nincorporating unobservable inputs for\nassumptions such as constant prepayment rates,\ndiscount rates and other factors. Due to the\nnature of the unobservable valuation inputs\nand the limited availability of market\npricing, commercial MSRs are classified as\nLevel 3. Significant increases (decreases) in\nconstant prepayment rates and discount rates\nwould have resulted in significantly lower\n(higher) commercial MSR value determined based\non current market conditions and expectations.\n\nFinancial Derivatives\n\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued using\nquoted market prices and are classified as\nLevel 1. The majority of derivatives that we\nenter into are executed over-the-counter and\nare valued using internal models. These\nderivatives are primarily classified as Level\n2, as the readily observable market inputs to\nthese models are validated to external\nsources, such as industry pricing services, or\nare corroborated through recent trades, dealer\nquotes, yield curves, implied volatility or\nother market-related data. Level 2 financial\nderivatives are primarily estimated using a\ncombination of Eurodollar future prices and\nobservable benchmark interest rate swaps to\nconstruct projected discounted cash flows.\n\nFinancial derivatives that are priced using\nsignificant management judgment or assumptions\nare classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs\nrelated to interest rate contracts include\nprobability of funding of residential mortgage\nloan commitments and estimated servicing cash\nflows of commercial and residential mortgage\nloan commitments. Probability of default and\nloss severity are the significant unobservable\ninputs used in the valuation of risk\nparticipation agreements. The fair values of\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 149\nrelated to these interest rate contract\nfinancial derivatives as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019 are included in the Insignificant\nLevel 3 assets, net of liabilities line item\nin Table 85 of this Note 15.\n\nIn connection with the sales of portions of\nour Visa Class B common shares, we entered\ninto swap agreements with the purchasers of\nthe shares to retain any future risk of\ndecreases in the conversion rate of Class B\ncommon shares to Class A common shares\nresulting from increases in the escrow funded\nby Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of\nspecified litigation (see Note 21 Legal\nProceedings). These swaps also require PNC to\nmake periodic payments based on the market\nprice of the Class A common shares at a fixed\nrate of interest (in certain cases subject to\nstep-up provisions) until the Visa litigation\nis resolved. An increase in the estimated\nlength of litigation resolution date, a\ndecrease in the estimated conversion rate, or\nan increase in the estimated growth rate of\nthe Class A share price would have had a\nnegative impact on the fair value of the swaps\nand vice versa.\n\nThe fair values of our derivatives include a\ncredit valuation adjustment to reflect our own\nand our counterparties\u2019 nonperformance risk.\nOur credit valuation adjustment is computed\nusing credit default swap spreads, in\nconjunction with internal historical recovery\nobservations.\n\nOther Assets and Liabilities\n\nOther assets held at fair value on a recurring\nbasis primarily include assets related to\nPNC\u2019s deferred compensation and supplemental\nincentive savings plans.\n\nThe assets related to PNC\u2019s deferred\ncompensation and supplemental incentive\nsavings plans primarily consist of a prepaid\nforward contract referencing an amount of\nshares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and\nfixed income funds, and are valued based on\nthe underlying investments. These assets are\nvalued either by reference to the market price\nof PNC\u2019s stock or by using the quoted market\nprices for investments other than PNC\u2019s stock\nand are classified in Levels 1 and 2.\n\nAll Level 3 other assets and liabilities are\nincluded in the Insignificant Level 3 assets,\nnet of liabilities line item in Table 85 in\nthis Note 15.\n\nOther Borrowed Funds\n\nOther borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S.\nTreasury securities sold short which are\nclassified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds\nalso includes the related liability for\ncertain repurchased loans for which we have\nelected the fair value option and are\nclassified as either Level 2 or Level 3,\nconsistent with the level classification of\nthe corresponding loans.

third-party provided\nvaluations or comparable asset prices.\n\n(d) Represents the aggregate amount of Level 3\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value\non a recurring basis that are

The amount\nincludes certain financial derivative assets\nand liabilities, trading securities, other\nsecurities, residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale, other assets, other borrowed funds\nand other liabilities.\n\n(e) Consisted of total Level 3 assets of $\n5.1billion and total Level 3 liabilities of $\n0.3billion as of December 31, 2020 and $\n5.4billion and $ 0.3billion as of December 31,\n2019, respectively.\n\nFinancial Assets Accounted for at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nWe may be required to measure certain\nfinancial assets at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair\nvalue usually result from the application of\nlower of amortized cost or fair value\naccounting or write-downs of individual assets\ndue to impairment and are included in Table\n86.\n\nNonaccrual Loans\n\nNonaccrual loans represent the fair value of\nthose loans which have been adjusted due to\nimpairment. The impairment is primarily based\non the appraised value of the collateral.\n\nAppraisals are obtained by licensed or\ncertified appraisers at least annually and\nmore recently in certain instances. All third-\nparty appraisals are reviewed and any\nadjustments to the initial appraisal are\nincorporated into the final issued appraisal\nreport. In instances where an appraisal is not\nobtained, collateral value is determined\nconsistent with external third-party appraisal\nstandards by an internal person independent of\nthe asset manager.\n\nOREO and Foreclosed Assets\n\nThe carrying value of OREO and foreclosed\nassets includes valuation adjustments recorded\nsubsequent to the transfer to OREO and\nforeclosed assets. These valuation adjustments\nare based on the fair value less cost to sell\nof the property. Fair value is based on\nappraised value or sales price and the\nappraisal process for OREO and foreclosed\nassets is the same as described above for\nnonaccrual loans.\n\nLong-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets consists of buildings for\nwhich valuation adjustments were recorded\nduring the period. A facility classified as\nheld and used is impaired to the extent its\ncarrying value is not recoverable and exceeds\nfair value. Valuation adjustments on buildings\nheld\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 155\nfor sale are based on the fair value of the\nproperty less an estimated cost to sell and\nare recorded subsequent to the transfer of the\nasset to held for sale status. Fair value is\ndetermined either by a third-party appraisal,\nrecent sales offer, changes in market or\nproperty conditions, or, where we have agreed\nto sell the building to a third party, the\ncontractual sales price. Impairment on these\nlong-lived assets is recorded in Other\nnoninterest expense on our Consolidated Income\nStatement.\n\nAssets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis follow:\n\nTable 86: Fair Value Measurements \u2013\nNonrecurring (a) (b) (c)\n                                              \n                 \u2026                            \n                 \u2026           \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                      $           \u2026      $    \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                      $           \u2026      $    \n                                              \n(a) All Level 3 for the periods presented.\n\n(b) Valuation techniques applied were fair\nvalue of property or collateral.\n\n(c) Unobservable inputs used were appraised\nvalue/sales price, broker opinions or\nprojected income/required improvement costs.\nAdditional quantitative information was not\nmeaningful for the periods presented.\n\nFinancial Instruments Accounted for under Fair\nValue Option\n\nWe elect the fair value option to account for\ncertain financial instruments.

We used the following methods\nand assumptions to estimate the fair value\namounts for these financial instruments.\n\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning\nDeposits with Banks\n\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying\namounts for Cash and due from banks and\nInterest-earning deposits with banks reported\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate\nfair value.\n\nSecurities Held to Maturity\n\nWe primarily use prices obtained from pricing\nservices, dealer quotes or recent trades to\ndetermine the fair value of securities. Refer\nto the Fair Value Measurement section of this\nNote 15 for additional information relating to\nour pricing processes and procedures.\n\nNet Loans\n\nFair values are estimated based on the\ndiscounted value of expected net cash flows\nincorporating assumptions about prepayment\nrates, net credit losses and servicing fees.\nNonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated\nrecovery value. Loans are presented net of the\nALLL.\n\nOther Assets\n\nOther assets includes accrued interest\nreceivable, cash collateral, federal funds\nsold and resale agreements, certain loans held\nfor sale, and FHLB and FRB stock. The\naggregate carrying value of our FHLB and FRB\nstock was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.6billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively,\nwhich approximated fair value at each date.\n\nDeposits\n\nFor time deposits, fair values are estimated\nby discounting contractual cash flows using\ncurrent market rates for instruments with\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing\nand interest-bearing demand and interest-\nbearing money market and savings deposits,\ncarrying values approximate fair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nFor short-term borrowed funds, including\nfederal funds purchased, commercial paper,\nrepurchase agreements and certain other short-\nterm borrowings and payables, carrying values\napproximated fair values. For long-term\nborrowed funds, quoted market prices are used,\nwhen available, to estimate fair value. When\nquoted market prices are not available, fair\nvalue is estimated based on current market\ninterest rates and credit spreads for debt\nwith similar terms and maturities.\n\nUnfunded Lending Related Commitments and\nLetters of Credit\n\nThe fair value of unfunded lending related\ncommitments and letters of credit is\ndetermined from a market participant\u2019s view\nincluding the impact of changes in interest\nrates and credit. We establish a liability on\nthese facilities related to the\ncreditworthiness of our counterparty.\n\nOther Liabilities\n\nOther liabilities includes interest-bearing\ncash collateral held related to derivatives\nand other accrued liabilities. Due to its\nshort-term nature, the carrying value of Other\nliabilities reported on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet approximates fair value.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 157\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair\nvalues, as well as the level within the fair\nvalue hierarchy, of these financial\ninstruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019\nare as follows:\n\nTable 89: Additional Fair Value Information\nRelated to Other Financial Instruments\n                                              \n                      \u2026                       \n                      2                       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n               $           \u2026                  \n                                  $           \n                           \u2026             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $           \u2026      $      $    \n                                              \n               $                  $           \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $                  $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $           \u2026                  \n                                  $           \n                           \u2026             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $           \u2026      $      $    \n                                              \n               $                  $           \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n               $                  $      $    \n                                              \nThe aggregate fair values in Table 89\nrepresent only a portion of the total market\nvalue of our assets and liabilities as, in\naccordance with the guidance related to fair\nvalues about financial instruments, we exclude\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 financial instruments recorded at fair value\non a recurring basis (as they are disclosed in\nTable 83),\n\n\u2022 investments accounted for under the equity\nmethod,\n\n\u2022 equity securities without a readily\ndeterminable fair value that apply for the\nalternative measurement approach to fair value\nunder ASU 2016-01,\n\n\u2022 real and personal property,\n\n\u2022 lease financing,\n\n\u2022 loan customer relationships,\n\n\u2022 deposit customer intangibles,\n\n\u2022 mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),\n\n\u2022 retail branch networks,\n\n\u2022 fee-based businesses, such as asset\nmanagement and brokerage,\n\n\u2022 trademarks and brand names,\n\n\u2022 trade receivables and payables due in one\nyear or less,\n\n\u2022 deposit liabilities with no defined or\ncontractual maturities under ASU 2016-01, and\n\n\u2022 insurance contracts.\n\n158 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  16 F                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  INANCIAL D ERIVATIVES                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to\nboth mitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risks inherent in\nour business activities, as well as to\nfacilitate customer risk management\nactivities.

Derivatives represent contracts\nbetween parties that usually require little or\nno initial net investment and result in one\nparty delivering cash or another type of asset\nto the other party based on a notional amount\nand an underlying as specified in the\ncontract.\n\nDerivative transactions are often measured in\nterms of notional amount, but this amount is\ngenerally not exchanged and it is not recorded\non the balance sheet. The notional amount is\nthe basis to which the underlying is applied\nto determine required payments under the\nderivative contract. The underlying is a\nreferenced interest rate, security price,\ncredit spread or other index.

Any nonperformance risk,\nincluding credit risk, is included in the\ndetermination of the estimated net fair value\nof the derivatives. Further discussion on how\nderivatives are accounted for is included in\nNote 1 Accounting Policies.\n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk as part of our\nasset and liability risk management activities\nare designated as accounting hedges.\nDerivatives hedging the risks associated with\nchanges in the fair value of assets or\nliabilities are considered fair value hedges,\nderivatives hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are considered cash\nflow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net\ninvestment in a foreign subsidiary are\nconsidered net investment hedges. Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to modify the interest\nrate characteristics of designated commercial\nloans from variable to fixed in order to\nreduce the impact of changes in future cash\nflows due to market interest rate changes. We\nalso periodically enter into forward purchase\nand sale contracts to hedge the variability of\nthe consideration that will be paid or\nreceived related to the purchase or sale of\ninvestment securities. The forecasted purchase\nor sale is consummated upon gross settlement\nof the forward contract itself. For these cash\nflow hedges, gains and losses on the interest\nrate swaps and forward contracts are recorded\nin AOCI and are then reclassified into\nearnings in the same period the hedged cash\nflows affect earnings and within the same\nincome statement line as the hedged cash\nflows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow December 31,\n2020, we expect to reclassify net derivative\ngains of $ 276million pretax, or $ 213million\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nboth cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to December 31,\n2020. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is ten years.\n\n160 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\nFurther detail

changes in foreign exchange rates. We\nassess whether the hedging relationship is\nhighly effective in achieving offsetting\nchanges in the value of the hedge and hedged\nitem by qualitatively verifying that the\ncritical terms of the hedge and hedged item\nmatch at the inception of the hedging\nrelationship and on an ongoing basis. Net\ninvestment hedge derivatives are classified as\nforeign exchange contracts. There were\nnocomponents of derivative gains or losses\nexcluded from the assessment of the hedge\neffectiveness for all periods presented. Net\ngains (losses) on net investment hedge\nderivatives recognized in OCI were $( 24)\nmillion at both 2020 and 2019 and $ 76million\nin 2018.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 161\nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging\nInstruments\n\nResidential mortgage loans that will be sold\nin the secondary market, and the related loan\ncommitments, which are considered derivatives,\nare accounted for at fair value. Changes in\nthe fair value of the loans and commitments\ndue to interest rate risk are hedged with\nforward contracts to sell mortgage-backed\nsecurities, as well as U.S. Treasury and\nEurodollar futures and options. Gains and\nlosses on the loans and commitments held for\nsale and the derivatives used to economically\nhedge them are included in Residential\nmortgage noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\n\nResidential mortgage servicing rights are\naccounted for at fair value with changes in\nfair value influenced primarily by changes in\ninterest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the\nfair value of residential mortgage servicing\nrights include interest rate futures, swaps,\noptions, and forward contracts to purchase\nmortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses\non residential mortgage servicing rights and\nthe related derivatives used for hedging are\nincluded in Residential mortgage noninterest\nincome.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nthe related loan commitments, which are\nconsidered derivatives, are accounted for at\nfair value. Derivatives used to economically\nhedge these loans and commitments from changes\nin fair value due to interest rate risk\ninclude forward loan sale contracts and\ninterest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the\ncommitments, loans and derivatives are\nincluded in Other noninterest income.\nDerivatives used to economically hedge the\nchange in value of commercial mortgage\nservicing rights include interest rate\nfutures, swaps and options. Gains or losses on\nthese derivatives are included in Corporate\nservices noninterest income.\n\nThe residential and commercial mortgage loan\ncommitments associated with loans to be sold\nwhich are accounted for as derivatives are\nvalued based on the estimated fair value of\nthe underlying loan and the probability that\nthe loan will fund within the terms of the\ncommitment. The fair value also takes into\naccount the fair value of the embedded\nservicing right.\n\nWe offer derivatives to our customers in\nconnection with their risk management needs.\nThese derivatives primarily consist of\ninterest rate swaps, interest rate caps and\nfloors, swaptions and foreign exchange\ncontracts. We primarily manage our market risk\nexposure from customer transactions by\nentering into a variety of hedging\ntransactions with third-party dealers. Gains\nand losses on customer-related derivatives are\nincluded in Other noninterest income.\n\nIncluded in the customer, mortgage banking\nrisk management, and other risk management\nportfolios are written interest-rate caps and\nfloors entered into with customers and for\nrisk management purposes. We receive an\nupfront premium from the counterparty and are\nobligated to make payments to the counterparty\nif the underlying market interest rate rises\nabove or falls below a certain level\ndesignated in the contract. Our ultimate\nobligation under written options is based on\nfuture market conditions.\n\nWe have entered into risk participation\nagreements to share some of the credit\nexposure with other counterparties related to\ninterest rate derivative contracts or to take\non credit exposure to generate revenue. The\nnotional amount of risk participation\nagreements sold was $ 7.0billion at December\n31, 2020 and $ 8.0billion at December 31,\n2019. Assuming all underlying third party\ncustomers referenced in the swap contracts\ndefaulted, the exposure from these agreements\nwould be $ 0.5billion at December 31, 2020 and\n$ 0.3billion at December 31, 2019 based on the\nfair value of the underlying swaps.\nFurther detail regarding the gains (losses) on\nderivatives not designated in hedging\nrelationships is presented in the following\ntable:\nTable 93: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives Not\nDesignated for Hedging\n                                              \n          Y\u2026                                  \n          e\u2026                                  \n  \u2026       D\u2026                                  \n  \u2026       31  2\u2026            2\u2026            2\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  7\u2026        $  405        $  -56      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2\u2026           125            99      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1\u2026           114           104      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       3\u2026           239           203      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       -\u2026           -1\u2026           268      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  8\u2026        $  507        $  415      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Included in Residential mortgage,\nCorporate services and Other noninterest\nincome on our Consolidated Income Statement.\n(b) Included in Other noninterest income on\nour Consolidated Income Statement.\n162 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nOffsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and\nContingent Features\n\nWe generally utilize a net presentation on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet for those\nderivative financial instruments entered into\nwith counterparties under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements. The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nIn certain cases, minimum thresholds must be\nexceeded before any collateral is exchanged.\nCollateral is typically exchanged daily on\nunsettled positions based on the net fair\nvalue of the positions with the counterparty\nas of the preceding day. Collateral\nrepresenting initial margin, which is based on\npotential future exposure, is also required to\nbe pledged by us in relation to derivative\ninstruments with central clearing house\ncounterparties. Any cash collateral exchanged\nwith counterparties under these master netting\nagreements is also netted, when appropriate,\nagainst the applicable derivative fair values\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However,\nthe fair value of any securities held or\npledged is not included in the net\npresentation on the balance sheet. In order\nfor derivative instruments under a master\nnetting agreement to be eligible for closeout\nnetting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient\nlegal review to conclude with a well-founded\nbasis that the offsetting rights included in\nthe master netting agreement would be legally\nenforceable upon an event of default,\nincluding upon an event of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, or a similar proceeding of the\ncounterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a\nlegal opinion that supports, with sufficient\nconfidence, the enforceability of the master\nnetting agreement in such circumstances.\n\nTable 94 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table\nincludes cash collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nThe table also includes the fair value of any\nsecurities collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash and securities collateral amounts are\nincluded in the table only to the extent of\nthe related net derivative fair values.\n\nTable 94 includes over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives and OTC derivatives cleared\nthrough a central clearing house. OTC\nderivatives represent contracts executed\nbilaterally with counterparties that are not\nsettled through an organized exchange or\ndirectly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house who then becomes our\ncounterparty. OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 163\nTable 94: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, we held cash, U.S.\ngovernment securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities totaling $ 2.3billion under master\nnetting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties, and we pledged\ncash totaling $ 1.9billion under these\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nliabilities owed to counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements. These totals may\ndiffer from the amounts presented in the\npreceding offsetting table because these\ntotals may include collateral exchanged under\nan agreement that does not qualify as a master\nnetting agreement or because the total amount\nof collateral held or pledged exceeds the net\nderivative fair values with the counterparty\nas of the balance sheet date due to timing or\nother factors, such as initial margin. To the\nextent not netted against the derivative fair\nvalues under a master netting agreement, the\nreceivable for cash pledged is included in\nOther assets and the obligation for cash held\nis included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held\nfrom counterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The aggregate fair\nvalue of all derivative instruments with\ncredit-risk-related contingent features that\nwere in a net liability position on December\n31, 2020 was $ 1.6billion for which we had\nposted collateral of $ 1.4billion in the\nnormal course of business.

Benefits are determined using a\ncash balance formula where earnings credits\nare a percentage of eligible compensation.\nEarnings credit percentages for those\nemployees who were plan participants on\nDecember 31, 2009 are frozen at the level\nearned to that point. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who became participants on or after\nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible\ncompensation. All plan participants earn\ninterest credits on their cash balances based\non 30-year Treasury securities rates with\nthose who were participants at December 31,\n2009 earning a minimum rate. New participants\non or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to\nthe minimum rate. Beginning in 2018, the plan\nprovides for a minimum annual earnings credit\namount of $ 2,000, subject to eligibility\ncriteria. Pension contributions to the plan\nare typically based on an actuarially\ndetermined amount necessary to fund total\nbenefits payable to plan participants. Assets\nof the qualified pension plan are held in a\nseparate Trust.\n\nWe also maintain nonqualified supplemental\nretirement plans for certain employees and\nprovide certain health care and life insurance\nbenefits for qualifying retired employees\n(postretirement benefits) through various\nplans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or\nmake changes to these plans at any time. The\nnonqualified pension plan is unfunded.\nContributions from PNC and, in the case of the\npostretirement benefit plans, participant\ncontributions cover all benefits paid under\nthe nonqualified pension plan and\npostretirement benefit plans. The\npostretirement plan provides benefits to\ncertain retirees that are at least actuarially\nequivalent to those provided by Medicare Part\nD and accordingly, we receive a federal\nsubsidy. PNC has established a VEBA to\npartially fund postretirement medical and life\ninsurance benefit obligations.\n\nWe use a measurement date of December 31 for\nplan assets and benefit obligations. The\nqualified pension plan assets and benefit\nobligation were re-measured as of January 31,\n2019 as a result of a plan amendment.\n\nA reconciliation of the changes in the\nprojected benefit obligation for qualified\npension, nonqualified pension and\npostretirement benefit plans as well as the\nchange in plan assets for the qualified\npension plan follows:\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 165\nTable 95: Reconciliation of Changes in\nProjected Benefit Obligation and Change in\nPlan Assets\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) The actuarial (gains)/losses and changes\nin assumptions in 2020 and 2019 were primarily\nrelated to a change in the discount rate used\nto measure the projected benefit obligation.\nPNC Pension Plan Assets\n\nThe long-term investment strategy for pension\nplan assets in our qualified pension plan (the\nPlan) is to:\n\n\u2022 Meet present and future benefit obligations\nto all participants and beneficiaries;\n\n\u2022 Cover reasonable expenses incurred to\nprovide such benefits, including expenses\nincurred in the administration of the Trust\nand the Plan;\n\n\u2022 Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit\nand expense payment requirements on a timely\nbasis;

Certain domestic equity\ninvestment managers utilize derivatives and\nfixed income securities as described in their\nInvestment Management Agreements to achieve\ntheir investment objective under the\nInvestment Policy Statement. Other investment\nmanagers may invest in eligible securities\noutside of their assigned asset category to\nmeet their investment objectives. The actual\npercentage of the fair value of total Plan\nassets held as of December 31, 2020 for equity\nsecurities, fixed income securities, real\nestate and all other assets are 61%, 21%, 5%\nand 13%, respectively.\n\nWe believe that, over the long term, asset\nallocation is the single greatest determinant\nof risk. Asset allocation will deviate from\nthe target percentages due to market movement,\ncash flows, investment manager performance and\nimplementation of shifts under the dynamic\nasset allocation policy. Material deviations\nfrom the asset allocation targets can alter\nthe expected return and risk of the Trust.\nHowever, frequent rebalancing of the asset\nallocation targets may result in significant\ntransaction costs, which can impair the\nTrust\u2019s ability to meet its investment\nobjective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is\nperiodically rebalanced to maintain asset\nallocation within the target ranges described\nabove.\n\nIn addition to being diversified across asset\nclasses, the Trust is diversified within each\nasset class. Secondary diversification\nprovides a reasonable basis for the\nexpectation that no single security or class\nof securities will have a disproportionate\nimpact on the total risk and return of the\nTrust.\n\nWhere investment strategies permit the use of\nderivatives and/or currency management,\nlanguage is incorporated in the managers\u2019\nguidelines to define allowable and prohibited\ntransactions and/or strategies.

   \n(a) Rate disclosed is for the qualified\npension plan.\n(b) Rate is applicable only to the\npostretirement benefit plans.\nThe discount rates are determined\nindependently for each plan by comparing the\nexpected future benefits that will be paid\nunder each plan with yields available on high\nquality corporate bonds of similar duration.\nFor this analysis, 10% of bonds with the\nhighest yields and 40% with the lowest yields\nwere removed from the bond universe.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-\nterm assumption established by considering\nhistorical and anticipated returns of the\nasset classes invested in by the pension plan\nand the allocation strategy currently in place\namong those classes. For purposes of setting\nand reviewing this assumption, \u201clong-term\u201d\nrefers to the period over which the plan\u2019s\nprojected benefit obligations will be\ndisbursed. We review this assumption at each\nmeasurement date and adjust it if warranted.\nOur selection process references certain\nhistorical data and the current environment,\nbut primarily utilizes qualitative judgment\nregarding future return expectations. We also\nexamine the assumption used by other companies\nwith similar pension investment strategies.\nTaking into account all of these factors, the\nexpected long-term return on plan assets for\ndetermining net periodic pension cost for 2020\nwas 5.50%. We are reducing our expected long-\nterm return on assets to 4.55% for determining\npension cost for 2021. This decision was made\nafter considering the views of both internal\nand external capital market advisors,\nparticularly with regard to the effects of the\nrecent economic environment on long-term\nprospective equity and fixed income returns.\n\n170 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nWith all other assumptions held constant, a\n0.50% decline in the discount rate would have\nresulted in an immaterial change in net\nperiodic benefit cost in 2020 and to be\nrecognized in 2021 for each of the qualified\npension, nonqualified pension and\npostretirement benefit plans.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nThe ISP is a qualified defined contribution\nplan that covers all of our eligible\nemployees. Newly-hired full time employees and\npart-time employees who are eligible to\nparticipate in the ISP are automatically\nenrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal\nto 4% of eligible compensation in the absence\nof an affirmative election otherwise. Employee\nbenefits expense related to the ISP was $\n147million in 2020, $ 139million in 2019 and $\n139million in 2018, representing cash\ncontributed to the ISP by PNC.\n\nThe ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an\nemployee stock ownership feature. Employee\ncontributions are invested in a number of\ninvestment options, including pre-mixed\nportfolios and individual core funds,\navailable under the ISP at the direction of\nthe employee.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  18 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  TOCK B ASED C OMPENSATION P LANS            \n                                              \nWe have long-term incentive award plans\n(Incentive Plans) that provide for the\ngranting of incentive stock options,\nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, incentive shares/performance units,\nrestricted share units, other share-based\nawards and dollar-denominated awards to\nexecutives and, other than incentive stock\noptions, to non-employee directors. Certain\nIncentive Plan awards may be paid in stock,\ncash or a combination of stock and cash. We\ntypically grant a substantial portion of our\nstock-based compensation awards during the\nfirst quarter of each year.\n\nIncentive/Performance Share Unit Awards and\nRestricted Share Unit Awards\n\nThe fair value of nonvested\nincentive/performance share unit awards and\nrestricted share unit awards is initially\ndetermined based on prices not less than the\nmarket value of our common stock on the date\nof grant with a reduction for estimated\nforfeitures. The value of certain\nincentive/performance unit awards is\nsubsequently remeasured based on the\nachievement of one or more financial and other\nperformance goals. Additionally, certain\nincentive/performance unit awards could\nrequire subsequent adjustment due to certain\ndiscretionary risk review triggers.\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of\nincentive/performance share unit awards and\nrestricted share unit awards granted in 2020,\n2019 and 2018 was $ 150.23, $ 117.53and $\n149.38per share, respectively. The total\nintrinsic value of incentive/performance share\nunit awards and restricted share unit awards\nvested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was\napproximately $ 213million, $ 218million and $\n254million, respectively.

A bank\nsubsidiary may not extend credit to, or engage\nin a covered transaction with, the parent\ncompany or a non-bank subsidiary if the\naggregate amount of the bank\u2019s extensions of\ncredit and other covered transactions with the\nparent company or non-bank subsidiary exceeds\n10% of the capital stock and surplus of such\nbank subsidiary or the aggregate amount of the\nbank\u2019s extensions of credit and other covered\ntransactions with the parent company and all\nnon-bank subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the\ncapital stock and surplus of such bank\nsubsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with\nlimited exceptions, must be at least fully\ncollateralized in accordance with specified\ncollateralization thresholds, with the\nthresholds varying based on the type of assets\nserving as collateral. In certain\ncircumstances, federal regulatory authorities\nmay impose more restrictive limitations.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the balance outstanding\nat the Federal Reserve Bank was $ 84.9billion.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  21 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in this Note 21).\nFor Disclosed Matters where we are able to\nestimate such possible losses or ranges of\npossible losses, as of December 31, 2020, we\nestimate that it is reasonably possible that\nwe could incur losses in excess of related\naccrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate\namount less than $ 100million. The estimates\nincluded in this amount are based on our\nanalysis of currently available information\nand are subject to significant judgment and a\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties. As\nnew information is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nIn our experience, legal proceedings are\ninherently unpredictable. One or more of the\nfollowing factors frequently contribute to\nthis inherent unpredictability: the proceeding\nis in its early stages; the damages sought are\nunspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is\nunclear whether a case brought as a class\naction will be allowed to proceed on that\nbasis or, if permitted to proceed as a class\naction, how the class will be defined; the\nother party is seeking relief other than or in\naddition to compensatory damages (including,\nin the case of regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations and inquiries, the possibility\nof fines and penalties); the matter presents\nmeaningful legal uncertainties, including\nnovel issues of law; we have not engaged in\nmeaningful settlement discussions; discovery\nhas not started or is not complete; there are\nsignificant facts in dispute; the possible\noutcomes may not be amenable to the use of\nstatistical or quantitative analytical tools;\npredicting possible outcomes depends on making\nassumptions about future decisions of courts\nor regulatory bodies or the behavior of other\nparties; and there are a large number of\nparties named as defendants (including where\nit is uncertain how damages or liability, if\nany, will be shared among multiple\ndefendants). Generally, the less progress that\nhas been made in the proceedings or the\nbroader the range of potential results, the\nharder it is for us to estimate losses or\nranges of losses that it is reasonably\npossible we could incur.\n\nAs a result of these types of factors, we are\nunable, at this time, to estimate the losses\nthat are reasonably possible to be incurred or\nranges of such losses with respect to some of\nthe matters disclosed, and the aggregate\nestimated amount provided above does not\ninclude an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 175\nInterchange Litigation\n\nBeginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust\nlawsuits were filed against Visa\u00ae,\nMastercard\u00ae, and several major financial\ninstitutions, including cases naming National\nCity (since merged into The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary,\nNational City Bank of Kentucky (since merged\ninto National City Bank which in turn was\nmerged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these\ncases are merchants operating commercial\nbusinesses throughout the U.S., as well as\ntrade associations. Some of these cases\n(including those naming National City\nentities) were brought as class actions on\nbehalf of all persons or business entities\nthat have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The\ncases have been consolidated for pre-trial\nproceedings in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of New York under the caption\nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and\nMerchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master\nFile No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JO).\n\nIn July 2012, the parties entered into a\nmemorandum of understanding with the class\nplaintiffs and an agreement in principle with\ncertain individual plaintiffs with respect to\na settlement of these cases, under which the\ndefendants agreed to pay approximately $\n6.6billion collectively to the class and\nindividual settling plaintiffs and agreed to\nchanges in the terms applicable to their\nrespective card networks (including an eight-\nmonth reduction in default credit interchange\nrates). The parties entered into a definitive\nagreement with respect to this settlement in\nOctober 2012. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement in December 2013. Several\nobjectors appealed the order of approval to\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit, which issued an order in June 2016,\nreversing approval of the settlement and\nremanding for further proceedings. In November\n2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court\nto challenge the court of appeal\u2019s decision.\nThe Supreme Court denied the petition in March\n2017.\n\nAs a result of the reversal of the approval of\nthe settlement, the class actions have resumed\nin the district court. In November 2016, the\ndistrict court appointed separate interim\nclass counsel for a proposed class seeking\ndamages and a proposed class seeking equitable\n(injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of\nthese counsel filed a proposed amended and\nsupplemental complaint on behalf of its\nrespective proposed class. These complaints\nmake similar allegations, including that the\ndefendants conspired to monopolize and to fix\nthe prices for general purpose card network\nservices, that the restructuring of Visa and\nMastercard, each of which included an initial\npublic offering, violated the antitrust laws,\nand that the defendants otherwise imposed\nunreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in\nthe payment of inflated interchange fees and\nother fees, which also violated the antitrust\nlaws. In their complaints, collectively the\nplaintiffs seek, among other things,\ninjunctive relief, unspecified damages\n(trebled under the antitrust laws) and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. PNC is named as a defendant\nin the complaint seeking damages but is not\nnamed as a defendant in the complaint that\nseeks equitable relief.\n\nIn September 2017, the magistrate judge at the\ndistrict court granted in part and denied in\npart the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to file their\nproposed amended complaints. The dispute over\namendment arose in part from the decision in\nUnited States v. American Express, Co., 838\nF.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), in which the court\nheld that the relevant market in a similar\ncomplaint against American Express is \u201ctwo-\nsided,\u201d i.e ., requires consideration of\neffects on consumers as well as merchants. In\nJune 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed\n(under the caption Ohio v. American Express\nCo. ) the court of appeals decision .\nPreviously, the plaintiffs in this litigation\nhad alleged a one-sided market, and, as a\nresult of the court\u2019s decision in American\nExpress , they sought leave to add claims\nbased on a two-sided market. The order allowed\nthe complaint to be amended to include\nallegations pertaining to a two-sided market\nonly to the extent those claims are not time-\nbarred, but held that the two-sided market\nallegations do not relate back to the time of\nthe original complaint and are not subject to\ntolling. In October 2017, the plaintiffs\nappealed this order to the presiding district\ncourt judge. In August 2018, the judge\noverruled this decision, finding that the two-\nsided market allegations do relate back.\n\nIn September 2018, the relevant parties\nentered an amended definitive agreement to\nresolve the claims of the class seeking\ndamages. In this amended settlement agreement,\nthe parties agreed, among other things, to the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\u2022 An additional settlement payment from all\ndefendants of $ 900million, with Visa\u2019s share\nof the additional settlement payment being $\n600million. The additional settlement payment\nwill be added to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously paid by the defendants\npursuant to the original 2012 settlement\nagreement.\n\n\u2022 Up to $ 700million may be returned to the\ndefendants (with up to $ 467million to Visa)\nif more than 15% of class members (by payment\nvolume) opt out of the class. As more than 15%\nof class members opted out of the class, $\n700million has been returned to the defendants\n($ 467million to Visa).\n\nThis amended settlement agreement is subject\nto court approval. Following preliminary\napproval in January 2019, and after class\nnotice, the submission of opt-outs, and the\nfiling of objections, the district court\ngranted final approval of the settlement in\nDecember 2019. Several objectors have appealed\nthe district court\u2019s order granting final\napproval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. Some merchants that opted out\nfrom the settlement have brought lawsuits\nagainst Visa and Mastercard and one or more of\nthe issuing banks. Resolution by Visa of\nclaims by merchants that opted out of the\nsettlement, including those that file\nlawsuits, have been or will be paid from the\nVisa litigation escrow account.\n\n176 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nNational City and National City Bank entered\ninto judgment and loss sharing agreements with\nVisa and certain other banks with respect to\nall of the above referenced litigation. We\nwere not originally named as defendants in any\nof the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust\nlitigation nor were we initially parties to\nthe judgment or loss sharing agreements.\nHowever, we became responsible for National\nCity\u2019s and National City Bank\u2019s position in\nthe litigation and responsibilities under the\nagreements through our acquisition of National\nCity. In addition, following Visa\u2019s\nreorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its\ninitial public offering, U.S. Visa members\nreceived shares of Class B Visa common stock,\nconvertible upon resolution of specified\nlitigation, including the remaining litigation\ndescribed above, into shares of Class A Visa\ncommon stock, with the conversion rate\nadjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed\nto resolve the specified litigation, and also\nremained responsible for indemnifying Visa\nagainst the specified litigation. Our Class B\nVisa common stock is all subject to this\nconversion adjustment provision, and we are\nnow responsible for the indemnification\nobligations of our predecessors as well as\nourselves. We have also entered into a\nMastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing\nAgreement with Mastercard and other financial\ninstitution defendants and an Omnibus\nAgreement Regarding Interchange Litigation\nSharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa,\nMastercard and other financial institution\ndefendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in\nsubstance, apportions resolution of the claims\nin this litigation into a Visa portion and a\nMastercard portion, with the Visa portion\nbeing two-thirds and the Mastercard portion\nbeing one-third. This apportionment only\napplies in the case of either a global\nsettlement involving all defendants or an\nadverse judgment against the defendants, to\nthe extent that damages either are related to\nthe merchants\u2019 inter-network conspiracy claims\nor are otherwise not attributed to specific\nMastercard or Visa conduct or damages. The\nMastercard portion (or any Mastercard-related\nliability not subject to the Omnibus\nAgreement) will then be apportioned under the\nMastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing\nAgreement among Mastercard and PNC and the\nother financial institution defendants that\nare parties to this agreement. The\nresponsibility for the Visa portion (or any\nVisa-related liability not subject to the\nOmnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under\nthe pre-existing indemnification\nresponsibilities and judgment and loss sharing\nagreements.\n\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities\nIndemnification Demands\n\nWe have received indemnification demands from\nseveral entities sponsoring residential\nmortgage-backed securities and their\naffiliates where purchasers of the securities,\ntrustees for the securitization trusts, or\nmonoline insurers have asserted claims against\nthe sponsors and other parties involved in the\nsecuritization transactions. National City\nMortgage and its predecessors had sold to the\nsponsors or their affiliates whole loans that\nwere allegedly included in certain of these\nsecuritization transactions. According to the\nindemnification demands, the claims for which\nindemnity is being sought are based on alleged\nmisstatements and omissions in the offering\ndocuments for these transactions or breaches\nof representations and warranties relating to\nthe loans made in connection with the\ntransactions. The indemnification demands\nassert that agreements governing the sale of\nthese loans or the securitization transactions\nto which National City Mortgage was a party\nrequire us to indemnify the sponsors and their\naffiliates for losses suffered in connection\nwith these claims.\n\nThe parties have settled several of these\ndisputes. In February 2020, one of the\nentities asserting a right to indemnification\nsubmitted a demand for our purported share of\nthe settlement amount of claims asserted\nagainst it and its affiliates. The portion of\nthe settlement amount, if any, for which we\nare responsible in the settled cases has not\nbeen determined.\n\nPre-need Funeral Arrangements\n\nNational City Bank and PNC Bank are defendants\nin a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Missouri under the\ncaption Jo Ann Howard and Associates, P.C., et\nal. v. Cassity, et al. (No. 4:09-CV-1252-ERW)\narising out of trustee services provided by\nAllegiant Bank, a National City Bank and PNC\nBank predecessor, with respect to Missouri\ntrusts that held pre-need funeral contract\nassets. Under a pre-need funeral contract, a\ncustomer pays an amount up front in exchange\nfor payment of funeral expenses following the\ncustomer\u2019s death. In a number of states,\nincluding Missouri, pre-need funeral contract\nsellers are required to deposit a portion of\nthe proceeds of the sale of pre-need funeral\ncontracts in a trust account.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in August 2009 by the\nSpecial Deputy Receiver for three insolvent\naffiliated companies, National Prearranged\nServices, Inc. a seller of pre-need funeral\ncontracts (NPS), Lincoln Memorial Life\nInsurance Company (Lincoln), and Memorial\nService Life Insurance Company (Memorial).\nSeven individual state life and health\ninsurance guaranty associations, who claim\nthey are liable under state law for payment of\ncertain benefits under life insurance policies\nsold by Lincoln and Memorial, and the National\nOrganization of Life & Health Guaranty\nAssociations have also joined the action as\nplaintiffs. In addition to National City Bank\nand PNC Bank (added following filing of the\nlawsuit as successor-in-interest to National\nCity Bank) (the PNC defendants), other\ndefendants included members of the Cassity\nfamily, who controlled NPS, Lincoln, and\nMemorial; officers and directors of NPS,\nLincoln, and Memorial; auditors and attorneys\nfor NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; the trustees\nof each of the trusts that held pre-need\nfuneral contract assets; and the investment\nadvisor to the Pre-need Trusts. NPS retained\nseveral banks to act as trustees for the\ntrusts holding NPS pre-need funeral contract\nassets (the NPS Trusts), with Allegiant Bank\nacting as one of these trustees with respect\nto seven Missouri NPS Trusts. All of the other\ndefendants have settled with the plaintiffs,\nare otherwise no longer a party to the\nlawsuit, or are insolvent.\n\nIn their Third Amended Complaint, filed in\n2012 following the granting by the court in\npart of motions to dismiss made by the PNC\ndefendants and the other NPS Trust trustees,\nthe plaintiffs allege that Allegiant Bank\nbreached its fiduciary duties and acted\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 177\nnegligently as the trustee for the Missouri\nNPS Trusts. In part as a result of these\nbreaches, the plaintiffs allege, members of\nthe Cassity family, acting in concert with\nother defendants, were able to improperly\nremove millions of dollars from the NPS\nTrusts, which in turn caused NPS, Lincoln, and\nMemorial to become insolvent. The complaint\nalleges $ 600million in present and future\nlosses to the plaintiffs due to the insolvency\nof NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial. The lawsuit\nseeks, among other things, unspecified actual\nand punitive damages, various equitable\nremedies including restitution, attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs of suit and interest.\n\nIn July 2013, five of the six defendants in a\nparallel federal criminal action, including\ntwo members of the Cassity family, entered\ninto plea agreements with the U.S. to resolve\ncriminal charges arising out of their conduct\nat NPS, Lincoln and Memorial. In August 2013,\nafter a jury trial, the sixth defendant, the\ninvestment advisor to the NPS Trusts, was\nconvicted on all criminal counts against him.\nThe criminal charges against the defendants\nalleged, among other thing, a scheme to\ndefraud Allegiant Bank and the other trustees\nof the NPS Trusts.\n\nIn May 2014, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion to disallow the PNC defendants\u2019\naffirmative defense relating to the\nplaintiffs\u2019 alleged failure to mitigate\ndamages. In July 2014, the PNC defendants\u2019\nmotion for reconsideration was denied. In\nSeptember 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion\nseeking leave to amend their complaint to\nreassert aiding and abetting claims,\npreviously dismissed by the court in 2012. The\ncourt denied this motion in December 2014.\nAlso in December 2014, the court granted in\npart and denied in part the PNC defendants\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\nIn March 2015, following a jury trial, the\ncourt entered a judgment against the PNC\ndefendants in the amount of $ 356million in\ncompensatory damages and $ 36million in\npunitive damages. In April 2015, the\nplaintiffs filed motions with the court\nseeking $ 179million in pre-judgment interest.\nAlso, in April 2015, the PNC defendants filed\nmotions with the court to reduce the\ncompensatory damages by the amounts paid in\nsettlement by other defendants, to strike the\npunitive damages award, for judgment as a\nmatter of law, and for a new trial. In\nNovember 2015, the court granted the motion to\nreduce the compensatory damages by amounts\npaid in settlement by other defendants and\ndenied the other motions by the PNC\ndefendants, with the judgment being reduced as\na result to a total of $ 289million, and also\ndenied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for pre-judgment\ninterest.\n\nIn December 2015, the PNC defendants appealed\nthe judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Eighth Circuit. Also in December 2015, the\nplaintiffs cross-appealed from the court\u2019s\norders reducing the judgment by amounts paid\nin settlement by other defendants, denying\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for pre-judgment interest,\nand dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 aiding and\nabetting claims. In August 2017, the court of\nappeals reversed the judgment to the extent\nthat it was based on tort rather than trust\nlaw. The court accordingly held that any\ndamages awarded to the plaintiff will be\nlimited to losses to the trusts in Missouri\ncaused by Allegiant\u2019s breaches during the time\nit acted as trustee; plaintiffs cannot recover\nfor damages to the Missouri trusts after\nAllegiant\u2019s trusteeship or outside of the\nMissouri trusts, which had been included in\nthe judgment under appeal. The court of\nappeals otherwise affirmed the judgment,\nincluding the dismissal of the aiding and\nabetting claims, and remanded the case to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings in\nlight of its decision.\n\nIn September 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion\nfor rehearing by the panel solely seeking to\nremove the prohibition on damages being sought\nfor the period following Allegiant\u2019s\ntrusteeship. In December 2017, the court\ndenied the petition for rehearing. In July\n2019, following a new trial on remand from the\ncourt of appeals, the district court awarded\nthe plaintiffs $ 72million in compensatory\ndamages, $ 15million in interest, and $\n15million in punitive damages. The PNC\ndefendants have appealed this judgment to the\ncourt of appeals, and the plaintiffs cross-\nappealed. In December 2019, the court reduced\nthe judgment by approximately $ 2.6million to\ncorrect a mathematical error in calculating\npre-judgment interest, reducing the total\njudgment to $ 99.5million. In March 2020, the\ncourt dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal\non the plaintiffs\u2019 motion . In February 2020,\nthe district court awarded $ 7million in fees\nand costs to the plaintiffs, and the PNC\ndefendants have appealed this judgment to the\ncourt of appeals. The consolidated appeals of\nthe district court\u2019s judgments were argued in\nJanuary 2021.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn September 2020, a lawsuit ( United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A., Case\nNo. 2:20-cv-319 ) was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District\nof Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement. The plaintiff amended its\ncomplaint in December 2020. As amended, the\ncomplaint alleges that PNC\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe on four\npatents owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff\nseeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC\nis infringing each of the patents, damages for\nwillful infringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In\nDecember 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint, and in January 2021, we\nfiled a motion to transfer the lawsuit to the\nUnited States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. Trial in this matter\nis presently scheduled to commence on March 7,\n2022.\n\nIn December 2020, we filed a lawsuit ( PNC\nBank, N.A. v. United Services Automobile\nAssociation, Case No. 2:20-cv-1886 ) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania against USAA seeking\ndeclaratory judgment of non-infringement as to\ntwo of the patents at issue in the lawsuit\npending in the Eastern District of Texas and\nawarding PNC its fees and costs.\n\n178 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2020 Form 10-K\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad range of\nissues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage,\nsecurities and other financial services\nbusinesses, as well as other aspects of our\noperations. In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of reviews of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries have involved\nand may in the future involve or lead to\nregulatory enforcement actions and other\nadministrative proceedings. These inquiries\nhave also led to and may in the future lead to\ncivil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some\nof these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences.\n\nAs has been publicly reported, the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice is conducting an inquiry\nrelating to the federal LIHTC program directed\nat program participants. In connection with\nthat inquiry, the Department of Justice\nrequested information from PNC Bank, and we\ncooperated in that inquiry.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries, including that\ndescribed in this Note 21.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described above, PNC and persons to\nwhom we may have indemnification obligations,\nin the normal course of business, are subject\nto various other pending and threatened legal\nproceedings in which claims for monetary\ndamages and other relief are asserted. We do\nnot anticipate, at the present time, that the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of such other legal proceedings will have\na material adverse effect on our financial\nposition. However, we cannot now determine\nwhether or not any claims asserted against us\nor others to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, whether in the proceedings or\nother matters described above or otherwise,\nwill have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations in any future reporting\nperiod, which will depend on, among other\nthings, the amount of the loss resulting from\nthe claim and the amount of income otherwise\nreported for the reporting period.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n                                 Form 10-K 179\n

To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock,\nwhich had previously been reported as a\nseparate business segment.

The\n\u201cOther\u201d category also includes our BlackRock\nheld for sale asset. Assets, revenue and\nearnings attributable to foreign activities\nwere not material in the periods presented for\ncomparison.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstand-alone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors.\n\nWe have allocated ALLL and the allowance for\nunfunded lending related commitments based on\nthe loan exposures within each business\nsegment\u2019s portfolio.

Typical servicing\nrights include the right to receive a fee for\ncollecting and forwarding payments on loans\nand related taxes and insurance premiums held\nin escrow.\n\nSupplementary leverage exposure - The sum of\nadjusted average assets and certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, including undrawn\ncredit commitments and derivative potential\nfuture exposures.\n\nSupplementary leverage ratio \u2013 Basel III Tier\n1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage\nexposure.\n\nTaxable-equivalent interest income \u2013 The\ninterest income earned on certain assets that\nis completely or partially exempt from federal\nincome tax. These tax-exempt instruments\ntypically yield lower returns than taxable\ninvestments. To provide more meaningful\ncomparisons of yields and margins for all\ninterest-earning assets, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on other\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement.\n\nTroubled debt restructuring (TDR) \u2013 A loan\nwhose terms have been restructured in a manner\nthat grants a concession to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulties.\n\nUnfunded lending related commitments \u2013 Standby\nletters of credit, financial guarantees,\ncommitments to extend credit and similar\n\nunfunded obligations that are not\nunilaterally, unconditionally, cancellable at\nPNC\u2019s option.\n\nValue-at-risk (VaR) \u2013 A statistically-based\nmeasure of risk that describes the amount of\npotential loss which may be incurred due to\nadverse market movements. The measure is of\nthe maximum loss which should not be exceeded\non 95 out of 100 days for a 95% VaR.\n\nYield curve \u2013 A graph showing the relationship\nbetween the yields on financial instruments or\nmarket indices of the same credit quality with\ndifferent maturities. For example, a \u201cnormal\u201d\nor \u201cpositive\u201d yield curve exists when long-\nterm bonds have higher yields than short-term\nbonds. A \u201cflat\u201d yield curve exists when yields\nare the same for short-term and long-term\nbonds. A \u201csteep\u201d yield curve exists when\nyields on long-term bonds are significantly\nhigher than on short-term bonds. An \u201cinverted\u201d\nor \u201cnegative\u201d yield curve exists when short-\nterm bonds have higher yields than long-term\nbonds.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2020\n

maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as such term is defined in the\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\n\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nWe performed an evaluation under the\nsupervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including the Chairman, President\nand Chief Executive Officer and the Executive\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer, of\nthe effectiveness of PNC\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31,\n2020. This assessment was based on criteria\nfor effective internal control over financial\nreporting described in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on this assessment,\nmanagement concluded that PNC maintained\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm that audited\nour consolidated financial statements as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2020\nincluded in this Report, has also audited
