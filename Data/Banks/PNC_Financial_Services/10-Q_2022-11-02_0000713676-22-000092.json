We have reclassified certain prior\nperiod amounts to conform with the current\nperiod presentation, which we believe is more\nmeaningful to readers of our consolidated\nfinancial statements. For information\nregarding certain business, regulatory and\nlegal risks, see the following: the Risk\nManagement section of this Financial Review\nand of Item 7 in our 2021 Form 10-K; Item 1A\nRisk Factors included in our 2021 Form 10-K;\nand the Commitments and Legal Proceedings\nNotes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 1 of this Report\nand our first and second quarter 2022 Form\n10-Qs and Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K. Also,\nsee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nFinancial Review and the Critical Accounting\nEstimates and Judgments section in this\nFinancial Review and in our 2021 Form 10-K for\ncertain other factors that could cause actual\nresults or future events to differ, perhaps\nmaterially, from historical performance and\nfrom those anticipated in the forward-looking\nstatements included in this Report.

(BBVA), a U.S. financial\nholding company conducting its business\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA. PNC paid $11.5 billion\nin cash as consideration for the acquisition.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC\nBank. On October 12, 2021, PNC converted\napproximately 2.6 million customers, 9,000\nemployees and over 600 branches across seven\nstates. Our results of operations and balance\nsheets for all periods presented in this\nReport reflect the benefit of BBVA's acquired\nbusinesses for the period since the\nacquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\n\nFor additional information on the acquisition\nof BBVA, see Note 2 Acquisition Activity in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Report and Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Income Statement Highlights                 \n                                              \nNet income of $1.6 billion, or $3.78 per\ndiluted common share, for the third quarter of\n2022 increased $144 million, or 10%, compared\nto $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common\nshare, for the second quarter of 2022,\nprimarily driven by higher net interest\nincome, partially offset by a higher provision\nfor credit losses.\n\n\u2022 For the three months ended September 30,\n2022 compared to the three months ended June\n30, 2022:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $433 million, or 8%,\nto $5.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income of $3.5 billion\nincreased $424 million, or 14%, driven by\nhigher yields on interest-earning assets and\nloan growth, partially offset by higher\nfunding costs.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 32 basis\npoints to 2.82% primarily due to higher yields\non interest-earning assets.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $9 million.\n\n\u2022 The third quarter of 2022 included a\nprovision for credit losses of $241 million,\nreflecting slightly weaker economic\nexpectations which impacted our macroeconomic\nscenarios and weightings. The second quarter\nof 2022 included a provision for credit losses\nof $36 million.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $36 million to\n$3.3 billion, reflecting increased personnel\nexpense to support business growth as well as\none additional day in the quarter.\n\n\u2022 We generated positive operating leverage of\n7%.\n\nNet income of $4.6 billion, or $10.39 per\ndiluted common share, for the first nine\nmonths of 2022 increased $146 million, or 3%,\ncompared to $4.4 billion, or $9.83 per diluted\ncommon share, for the first nine months of\n2021, driven by higher net interest income,\npartially offset by an increased provision for\ncredit losses, higher expenses and lower\nnoninterest income.\n\n\u2022 For the nine months ended September 30, 2022\ncompared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2021:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 9%,\nto $15.4 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income increased $1.5 billion,\nor 20%, due to higher interest-earning asset\nbalances, which included the benefit of BBVA,\nand higher yields, partially offset by higher\nfunding costs.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin increased 26 basis\npoints, primarily due to higher yields on\ninterest-earning assets.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $272 million,\nor 4%, primarily due to lower private equity,\nresidential and commercial mortgage and\ncapital markets related fees, partially offset\nby an increase in card and cash management\nrevenue and $1 million of positive Visa Class\nB fair value adjustments compared to $165\nmillion of negative adjustments for the same\nperiod in 2021.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $485 million,\nor 5%, driven by the addition of BBVA\noperating expenses and continued business\ninvestment, partially offset by lower\nintegration expenses and a decline in variable\ncompensation related to lower business\nactivity.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nIncome Statement Review section of this\nFinancial Review.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 3\n                                              \n  Balance Sheet Highlights                    \n                                              \nOur balance sheet was well positioned at\nSeptember 30, 2022. In comparison to December\n31, 2021:\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased modestly, to $559.5\nbillion.\n\n\u2022 Total loans increased $27.0 billion, or 9%,\nto $315.4 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans increased $22.5\nbillion, or 12%, to $215.6 billion, driven by\nnew production and higher utilization of loan\ncommitments, partially offset by PPP loan\nforgiveness.\n\n\u2022 PPP loans outstanding were $0.6 billion and\n$3.4 billion at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans increased $4.5 billion,\nor 5%, to $99.8 billion, primarily due to\nincreases in residential mortgages, home\nequity and credit card, partially offset by\ndeclines in the remaining portfolios as\npaydowns outpaced new originations.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities increased $3.5 billion\nto $136.5 billion, as a result of net purchase\nactivity, partially offset by net unrealized\nlosses.\n\n\u2022 Interest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the Federal Reserve Bank,\ndecreased $34.0 billion, or 46%, to $40.3\nbillion, reflecting higher loans outstanding\nand lower deposits, partially offset by an\nincrease in borrowed funds.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits decreased $19.1 billion, or\n4%, to $438.2 billion due to lower commercial\nand consumer deposits, reflecting deposit\noutflows, higher consumer spending and the\nimpact of inflationary pressures.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds increased $23.8 billion, or\n77%, to $54.6 billion, driven by increased\nFHLB borrowings, partially offset by lower\nbank notes and senior debt.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nThe third quarter of 2022 reflected strong\ncredit quality performance.\n\n\u2022 At September 30, 2022 compared to December\n31, 2021:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets of $2.1 billion\ndecreased $405 million, or 16%, due to lower\ncommercial and consumer nonperforming loans.\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.6 billion\ndecreased $359 million, or 18%, driven by\nlower consumer delinquencies, which included\nthe resolution of BBVA USA conversion-related\nadministrative and operational delays.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, decreased to $5.3\nbillion, or 1.67% of total loans, at September\n30, 2022, compared to $5.5 billion, or 1.92%\nof total loans at December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease was primarily driven by the\nreassessment of pandemic-related risks and the\nimpacts of portfolio changes, partially offset\nby weaker economic expectations.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs of $119 million, or 0.15% of\naverage loans, in the third quarter of 2022\nincreased $36 million, or 43%, compared to $83\nmillion, or 0.11% of average loans, for the\nsecond quarter of 2022, primarily driven by\nhigher commercial loan net charge-offs.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Capital Highlights                          \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital position.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders\u2019 equity of $39.4 billion\nat September 30, 2022, decreased $11.3\nbillion, or 22%, compared to December 31, 2021\nas the benefit of net income was more than\noffset by a decrease in AOCI, reflecting the\nnegative impact of higher interest rates on\nnet unrealized securities and swap losses. The\ndecline was also attributable to share\nrepurchases and common dividends paid.\n\n\u2022 In the third quarter, we returned $1.7\nbillion of capital to shareholders through\ncommon share repurchases of $1.1 billion,\nrepresenting 6.7 million shares, and dividends\non common shares of $0.6 million.\n\n\u2022 The SCB framework allows for capital returns\nin amounts up to the level of capital in\nexcess of the firm's SCB plus the regulatory\nminimum level of capital. Consistent with the\nflexibility provided under the SCB framework,\nour Board of Directors has authorized a\nrepurchase framework under the previously\napproved repurchase program of up to 100\nmillion common shares, of which approximately\n53% were still available for repurchase at\nSeptember 30, 2022. Under this framework, PNC\nexpects its quarterly repurchases to\napproximate $700 million to $750 million with\nthe ability to adjust those levels as\nconditions warrant. PNC's SCB for the four-\nquarter period beginning October 1, 2022 is\n2.9%.\n\n\u2022 On October 3, 2022, the PNC Board of\nDirectors declared a quarterly cash dividend\non common stock of $1.50 per share payable on\nNovember 5, 2022.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio decreased to 9.3% at\nSeptember 30, 2022 from 10.3% at December 31,\n2021.\n    4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\n\u2022 PNC elected to delay the estimated impact of\nCECL on CET1 capital through December 31,\n2021, followed by a three-year transition\nperiod. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1\ncapital is defined as the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the initial allowance for PCD loans\nfrom BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at adoption.\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nis now in the three-year transition period,\nand the full impact of the CECL standard is\nbeing phased-in to regulatory capital through\nDecember 31, 2024. The CET1 fully implemented\nratio, which reflects the full impact of CECL\nand excludes the benefits of the optional\nfive-year transition, was 9.1% at September\n30, 2022 compared to 10.0% at December 31,\n2021.\n\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of this\nFinancial Review for more detail on our 2022\nliquidity and capital actions as well as our\ncapital ratios.\n\nPNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital actions,\nincluding returning capital to shareholders,\nis subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB\nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board in\nconnection with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nCCAR process.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 Although real GDP contracted in the first\nand second quarters of 2022, the U.S. economy\nis not in recession. In particular, the labor\nmarket remains extremely strong, with average\nmonthly job growth well above the pre-pandemic\npace, and the unemployment rate at a 50-year\nlow. Supply-chain difficulties will continue\nto ease into 2023. Labor shortages will remain\na constraint into 2023, although strong wage\ngrowth and high levels of household saving\nwill support consumer spending.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects economic growth will be below\nits long-term trend in the near term as the\nFederal Reserve continues to tighten monetary\npolicy in an attempt to reduce inflationary\npressures, but does not expect a near-term\nrecession. Recession risks over the next few\nyears are elevated, however, because of\ntighter monetary policy.\n\n\u2022 Inflation has started to slow, but remains\nnear the strongest pace in decades. Inflation\nshould slow further due to softer economic\ngrowth and a continued easing in supply-chain\ndifficulties and will return to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s 2% long-run objective in 2024.\n\n\u2022 The FOMC raised the federal funds rate by\n0.75% in September, to a range of 3.00% to\n3.25%. PNC expects further increases in the\nfederal funds rate through the rest of this\nyear, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% at the end\nof 2022. PNC expects the federal funds rate to\npeak between 4.50% and 4.75% in early 2023,\nbefore falling in early 2024 as inflation ebbs\nand economic growth slows.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to\nthe third quarter of 2022, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans to be up approximately 1%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up 6% to 8%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be stable to down 1%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, excluding net\nsecurities gains and Visa activity, to be $200\nmillion to $250 million,\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be up approximately 2%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%,\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be $125 million to\n$175 million, and\n\n\u2022 Effective tax rate to be approximately\n18.5%.\n\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nFinancial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in\nour 2021 Form 10-K for other factors that\ncould cause future events to differ, perhaps\nmaterially, from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements.\n                                              \n   C                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ONSOLIDATED                                \n                                              \n                                              \n   I                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   NCOME                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   S                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   TATEMENT                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n   R                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   EVIEW                                      \n                                              \nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented\nin Item 1 of this Report.\n\nNet income of $1.6 billion, or $3.78 per\ndiluted common share for the third quarter of\n2022 increased $144 million, or 10%, compared\nto $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common\nshare for the second quarter of 2022,\nprimarily driven by higher net interest\nincome, partially offset by a higher provision\nfor credit losses.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income increased $424 million, or\n14%, for the third quarter of 2022 compared to\nthe second quarter of 2022, driven by higher\nyields on interest-earning assets and loan\ngrowth, partially offset by higher funding\ncosts. Net interest income increased $1.5\nbillion, or 20%, for the first nine months of\n2022 compared to the same period in 2021, due\nto higher interest-earning asset balances,\nwhich included the benefit of BBVA, and higher\nyields, partially offset by higher funding\ncosts.\n    6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\nNet interest margin in the quarterly and year-\nto-date comparisons increased 32 basis points\nand 26 basis points, respectively. In both\ncomparisons the increase was primarily due to\nhigher yields on interest-earning assets.\n\nAverage investment securities for the third\nquarter of 2022 increased $2.3 billion, or 2%\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022\nreflecting net purchases, primarily of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities within\nthe held-to-maturity portfolio. Average\ninvestment securities increased $29.9 billion,\nor 28% in the year-to-date comparison, due to\nnet securities purchases, primarily of U.S.\nTreasury and government agency securities,\nagency residential mortgage-backed securities\nand the addition of BBVA. Average investment\nsecurities represented 28% of average\ninterest-earning assets for both the third and\nsecond quarter of 2022, and 27% for the first\nnine months of 2022 compared to 23% for the\nfirst nine months of 2021.\n\nIn the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\naverage loans increased $8.2 billion, or 3%,\nand $41.0 billion, or 16%, respectively. In\nboth comparisons, the increase was due to\ngrowth in commercial and consumer loans,\npartially offset by PPP loan forgiveness. The\nincrease in the year-to-date comparison also\nreflects the impact of the BBVA acquisition.\nAverage loans represented 64% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the third quarter\nof 2022 compared to 62% for the second quarter\nof 2022, and 62% for the first nine months of\n2022 compared to 57% for the first nine months\nof 2021.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nfor the third quarter of 2022 decreased $7.8\nbillion, or 20%, compared to the second\nquarter of 2022, driven by increased loans\noutstanding and lower deposits, partially\noffset by higher borrowed funds. In the year-\nto-date comparison, average interest-earning\ndeposits with banks decreased $36.7 billion,\nor 45%, reflecting higher loan balances and\nnet securities purchases, partially offset by\nhigher deposits.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits for the\nthird quarter of 2022 were largely stable\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased\n$24.7 billion, or 9%, in the year-to-date\ncomparison, reflecting the BBVA acquisition\nand the shift in commercial deposits from\nnoninterest-bearing to interest bearing as\ndeposit rates have risen. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits represented 87% of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities for the\nthird quarter of 2022 compared to 89% for the\nsecond quarter of 2022, and the first nine\nmonths of both 2022 and 2021.\n\nAverage borrowed funds for the third quarter\nof 2022 increased $8.6 billion, or 24%,\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022,\nprimarily due to increased FHLB borrowings.\nAverage borrowed funds for the first nine\nmonths of 2022 increased $2.2 billion, or 6%,\ncompared to the first nine months of 2021,\nreflecting higher FHLB borrowings, partially\noffset by lower bank notes and senior debt.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 3: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 37% for the third quarter of 2022\ncompared to 40% for second quarter of 2022,\nand 39% for the first nine months of 2022\ncompared to 45% for the same period in 2021.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees decreased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022 , and\nincluded the impact of lower average equity\nmarkets. The increase in the year-to-date\ncomparison reflected the benefit of BBVA and\nincreased product sales, partially offset by\nlower average equity markets. PNC's\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nof $166 billion at September 30, 2022\ndecreased from $167 billion at June 30, 2022\nand $183 billion at September 30, 2021 ,\nprimarily as a result of lower spot equity\nmarkets.\n\nCapital markets related revenue decreased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022 driven\nby lower merger and acquisition advisory fees,\nreflecting the impact of elevated second\nquarter activity. In the year-to-date\ncomparison the decrease was primarily due to a\ndecline in equity capital markets advisory,\nunderwriting and merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 7\n\nCard and cash management revenue was stable\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022. The\nincrease in the year-to-date comparison was\nprimarily due to increased treasury management\nproduct revenue, the addition of BBVA and\nhigher consumer spending.\n\nLending and deposit services increased\ncompared to the second quarter of 2022, driven\nby higher loan commitment fees. The increase\nin the year-to-date comparison included the\nbenefit of BBVA.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage decreased\nin both the quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons, primarily due to lower\nresidential mortgage banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income increased compared to\nthe second quarter of 2022, and included\nhigher private equity revenue and positive\nVisa Class B derivative fair value adjustments\nof $13 million. The second quarter of 2022\nincluded $16 million of negative Visa Class B\nfair value adjustments. The decrease in the\nyear-to-date comparison was primarily due to\nlower private equity revenue, partially offset\nby positive Visa Class B derivative fair value\nadjustments.

positioned at\nSeptember 30, 2022. In comparison to December\n31, 2021:\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased modestly, reflecting\nhigher loans, securities and MSRs, partially\noffset by lower balances held with the Federal\nReserve Bank.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased primarily due to\nhigher borrowed funds, partially offset by\nlower deposits.\n\n\u2022 Total equity decreased as the benefit of net\nincome and preferred stock issuances was more\nthan offset by a decrease in AOCI, reflecting\nthe negative impact of higher interest rates\non net unrealized securities and swap losses.\nThe decline was also attributable to common\nshare repurchases and dividends paid.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.3 billion\nat September 30, 2022, a decrease of $0.2\nbillion since December 31, 2021, driven by the\nreassessment of pandemic-related risks and the\nimpacts of portfolio changes, partially offset\nby weaker economic expectations.

The relationship of fair value to\namortized cost at September 30, 2022 compared\nto December 31, 2021 primarily reflected the\nimpact of higher interest rates on the\nvaluation of fixed rate securities. We have\nincluded credit ratings information because we\nbelieve that the information is an indicator\nof the degree of credit risk to which we are\nexposed. Changes in credit ratings\nclassifications could indicate increased or\ndecreased credit risk and could be accompanied\nby a reduction or increase in the fair value\nof our investment securities portfolio. We\ncontinually monitor the credit risk in our\nportfolio and maintain the allowance for\ninvestment securities at an appropriate level\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\ninvestment securities portfolio for the\nremaining contractual term of the securities\nadjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 3\nInvestment Securities in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Report for additional details\nregarding the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2022, we\ntransferred securities with a fair value of\n$82.7 billion, from available for sale to held\nto maturity. We changed our intent and\ncommitted to hold these high-quality\nsecurities to maturity in order to reduce the\nimpact of price volatility on AOCI and\ntangible capital.

and a higher\nprovision for credit losses, partially offset\nby higher net interest and noninterest income.\n\nNet interest income increased primarily due to\ngrowth in average deposit and loan balances,\nreflecting the BBVA acquisition, along with\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits, partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on the value of loans.\n\nNoninterest income increased due to the\nfavorable impact of Visa Class B fair value\nadjustments compared to a negative adjustment\nin 2021 related to expected litigation timing.\nThe increase was also driven by higher card\nand cash management revenue, increased asset\nmanagement and brokerage fees and higher\nlending and deposit related fees, which\nincluded the addition of BBVA customers.\n\nNoninterest expense increased due to the\nimpact of BBVA operating expenses, increased\nbusiness activity and continued investments in\nstrategic initiatives.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 15\n\nthe first nine months of 2022, average total\ndeposits increased compared to the same period\nin 2021, primarily driven by growth in demand\nand savings deposits which included the impact\nof the BBVA acquisition.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin the first nine months of 2022 compared to\nthe same period in 2021. Average consumer\nloans increased 15% due to the impact of the\nBBVA acquisition on all loan classes except\neducation loans, which BBVA did not have in\ntheir loan portfolio. In addition, average\nresidential real estate loans increased, as\nnew originations outpaced the runoff. The\nincrease was partially offset by a decline in\nother consumer loans as paydowns outpaced new\noriginations. Average commercial loans\ndecreased primarily due to forgiveness of PPP\nloans.\n\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing\ncustomers and meeting their financial needs,\nwe have established a coast-to-coast network\nof retail branches and ATMs that operate\nalongside PNC\u2019s suite of digital capabilities.\nOver time, we plan to continue to convert a\nportion of these branches to solution centers,\nwhich have a distinctive layout and the\ncapability to support transactions, sales and\nadvice using a combination of technology and\npersonalized banker assistance. PNC began to\ndeploy solution centers in 2018.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking, payments and investment\nproducts. In 2021, we successfully rolled out\nLow Cash Mode \u00ae to all Virtual Wallet \u00ae\ncustomers providing them with the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent\nor address overdrafts and controls to choose\nwhether to return certain debits rather than\nthe bank making the decision. In August, we\neliminated non-sufficient fund fees for all\nconsumer checking account customers. Virtual\nWallet \u00ae customers had previously received\nthis benefit with the launch of Low Cash Mode\n\u00ae .\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result, have closed 105 branches in\nthe first nine months of 2022, consistent with\nour plan.\n   16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased, primarily\ndriven by higher utilization of loan\ncommitments and new production.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting loans from\nBBVA and new production, partially offset by\nlower average utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by PPP\nloan forgiveness, partially offset by loans\nfrom BBVA.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased slightly\ncompared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2021. We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nto evolving market conditions, bank funding\nneeds and client relationship dynamics.\n\nIn 2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s geographic\nexpansion. Following the BBVA acquisition and\nour de novo expansion efforts, we are now a\ncoast-to-coast franchise and have a presence\nin the 30 largest U.S. metropolitan\nstatistical areas. These expanded locations\ncomplement Corporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s\nexisting national businesses with a\nsignificant presence in these cities and our\nfull suite of commercial products and services\nis now offered nationally.\n                                              \n  Product Revenue                             \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital markets\nrelated products and services and commercial\nmortgage banking activities, for customers of\nall business segments. On a consolidated\nbasis, the revenue from these other services\nis included in net interest income and\nnoninterest income, as appropriate. From a\nbusiness perspective, the majority of the\nrevenue and expense related to these services\nis reflected in the Corporate & Institutional\nBanking segment results and the remainder is\nreflected in the results of other businesses\nwhere the customer relationship exists. The\nOther Information section in Table 12 includes\nthe consolidated revenue to PNC for treasury\nmanagement and commercial mortgage banking\nservices. A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nWithin Treasury Management, PNC Global\nTransfers provides wholesale money transfer\nprocessing capabilities between the U.S. and\nMexico and other countries primarily in\nCentral and South America. Treasury management\nrevenue is reported in noninterest income and\nnet interest income. Noninterest income\nincludes treasury management product revenue\nless earnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services. Net interest income\nincludes revenue from all treasury management\ncustomer deposit balances. Compared to the\nfirst nine months of 2021, treasury management\nrevenue increased due to wider interest rate\nspreads on the value of deposits and higher\nnoninterest income, including the impact of\nthe BBVA acquisition.\n   18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower revenue from commercial\nmortgage loans held for sale and lower\ncommercial mortgage servicing income,\npartially offset by a higher benefit from\ncommercial mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation, net of economic hedge.\n\nCapital markets related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The noninterest income\ngenerated from these revenue streams is\nreflected in the capital markets related\ncategory on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nCompared to the first nine months of 2021,\ncapital markets related noninterest income\ndecreased due to lower equity capital markets\nadvisory fees, lower underwriting fees and\nlower merger and acquisition fees. These\ndecreases were partially offset by higher fees\non customer-related derivatives activities and\nhigher loan syndication fees.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 19\n

The majority of our commercial\nand industrial loans are secured by collateral\nthat provides a secondary source of repayment\nfor the loan should the borrower experience\ncash generation difficulties. Examples of this\ncollateral include short-term assets, such as\naccounts receivable, inventory and securities;\nand long-lived assets, such as equipment,\nowner-occupied real estate and other business\nassets.\n\nWe actively manage our commercial and\nindustrial loans to assess any changes (both\npositive and negative) in the level of credit\nrisk at both the borrower and portfolio level.\nTo evaluate the level of credit risk, we\nassign internal risk ratings reflecting our\nestimates of the borrower\u2019s PD and LGD for\neach related credit facility. This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geographies that may exist in our\nportfolio.

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $39.8 billion at September 30,\n2022 with 44% located in California.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2021 were\n$34.9 billion and 42%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $18.6 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $6.8 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at September 30,\n2022. Comparable amounts were $15.8 billion\nand $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance of this\nportfolio monthly similarly to residential\nreal estate loans. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit, brokered\nhome equity lines of credit) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold the lien.\nThis information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n   24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          30,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5,\u2026    20    %    $  5\u2026     21   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    13            3\u2026     13      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026     9            2\u2026     10      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     8            1\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            7\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       965     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       5,\u2026    24            5\u2026     23      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  25\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              60    %              62   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              40                   38      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       Se\u2026                  D\u2026             \n  \u2026       30,                  3\u2026             \n  \u2026       20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  775                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              67    %              66   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at September 30, 2022.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $13.9 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.1 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of September 30,\n2022.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower, repayment sources,\nunderlying collateral, and other support given\ncurrent events, economic conditions and\nexpectations. We refine our practices to meet\nthe changing environment resulting from rising\ninflation levels, supply chain disruptions,\nhigher rates, and secular changes fostered by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance. As a result,\nunder the CARES Act credit reporting rules,\ncertain loans modified due to COVID-19 related\nhardships are not being reported as past due\nas of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\naccruing loans past due by delinquency status:\n                                              \n  Table 22: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)       \n                                              \n                                              \n                                  %           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion\nand $0.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe decline in accruing loans past due from\nDecember 31, 2021 was driven by lower consumer\ndelinquencies, which included the resolution\nof BBVA USA conversion-related administrative\nand operational delays.\n\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\ncontinue to accrue interest because they are\n(i) well secured by collateral and are in the\nprocess of collection, (ii) managed in\nhomogeneous portfolios with specified charge-\noff timeframes adhering to regulatory\nguidelines, or (iii) certain government\ninsured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions ( e.g. , a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan).

At September 30, 2022, PNC Bank had\n$9.3 billion of notes outstanding under this\nprogram of which $4.5 billion were senior bank\nnotes and $4.8 billion were subordinated bank\nnotes.\n\nPNC Bank maintains additional secured\nborrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh\nand through the Federal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is\nnot viewed as a primary means of funding our\nroutine business activities, but rather as a\npotential source of liquidity in a stressed\nenvironment or during a market disruption. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, our unused secured\nborrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank totaled $63.9\nbillion.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At September 30, 2022,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing its\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 31\n\nAt September 30, 2022, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $8.8 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $2.4 billion at September 30,\n2022. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K for\nfurther discussion of these limitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Authorized by the Board of\nDirectors, the parent company has the ability\nto offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial\npaper to provide additional liquidity. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, there were no commercial\npaper issuances outstanding.\n\nParent company senior and subordinated debt\noutstanding totaled $10.0 billion and $11.4\nbillion at September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively.\n\nSee Note 17 Subsequent Events in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements of this\nReport for details on the parent company's\nissuance of $1.0 billion of its 5.671% senior\nfixed-to-floating rate notes that mature on\nOctober 28, 2025, and $1.5 billion of its\n6.037% senior fixed-to-floating rate notes\nthat mature on October 28, 2033.\n                                              \n  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     \n                                              \nWe have contractual obligations representing\nrequired future payments on borrowed funds,\ntime deposits, leases, pension and\npostretirement benefits and purchase\nobligations. See the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of our 2021 Form 10-K for more\ninformation on these future cash outflows.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of business\nwe have various commitments outstanding,\ncertain of which are not included on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.

The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC\u2019s\nelection to adopt the CECL five-year\ntransition provisions. Effective for the first\nquarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital through December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the\nfull impact of CECL and excludes the benefits\nof the optional five-year transition.\n\n(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have\nelected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\n\n(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-\nweighted assets are based on the Basel III\nstandardized approach rules and include credit\nand market risk-weighted assets.\n\n(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account the quarterly average of both on\nbalance sheet assets as well as certain off-\nbalance sheet items, including loan\ncommitments and potential future exposure\nunder derivative contracts.\n\n(f) All ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital methodology applicable to\nPNC and calculated based on the standardized\napproach.\n\n(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier\n1 capital divided by Average quarterly\nadjusted total assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting certain banks, including PNC, to\ndelay the estimated impact on regulatory\ncapital stemming from implementing CECL.\nCECL\u2019s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as\ndefined by the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the initial allowance for PCD loans\nfrom BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at adoption.\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC\nis now in the three-year transition period,\nand the full impact of the CECL standard is\nbeing phased-in to regulatory capital through\nDecember 31, 2024. See additional discussion\nof this rule in the Supervision and Regulation\nsection of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk\nFactors of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, PNC and PNC Bank were\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on\napplicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d, PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and\na Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient\n   34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\nto withstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our September 30,\n2022 capital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management                      \n                                              \nSee the Market Risk Management portion of the\nRisk Management Section in our 2021 Form 10-K\nfor additional discussion regarding market\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans. Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our risk management policies,\nwhich are approved by management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the third quarters of 2022 and\n2021 follow:\n                                              \n  Table 29: Interest Sensitivity Analysis     \n                                              \n                                              \n                   Third             Third    \n                   Quarter           Quarter  \n                   2022              2021     \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       2.5  %            4.5  %        \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point      -2.5  %                 N/A      \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       4.5  %           11.3  %        \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  100                                         \n  basis                                       \n  point      -4.8  %                 N/A      \n  decrea\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n                                              \n(a) Due to the prevailing low interest rate\nenvironment post pandemic, the reporting of\nNet interest income sensitivities for the 100\nbasis point decrease scenario was suspended\nfrom the first quarter of 2020 to the first\nquarter of 2022.\n\nIn addition to measuring the effect on net\ninterest income assuming parallel changes in\ncurrent interest rates, we routinely simulate\nthe effects of a number of nonparallel\ninterest rate environments.

Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in our Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2021 Form 10-K and in Note 12 Fair Value\nand Note 13 Financial Derivatives in the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1\nof this Report.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ECENT                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGULATORY                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVELOPMENTS                                 \n                                              \nIn August 2022, the President signed into law\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the\n\u201cAct\u201d). Among other things, including the\nallocation of $369.0 billion for climate-\nrelated spending such as clean energy tax\ncredits and investments, the Act imposes a 15%\nminimum tax on the adjusted financial\nstatement income of taxpayers like PNC with\nmore than $1.0 billion of such income. The Act\nalso imposes a 1% excise tax on corporate\nstock repurchases. The minimum tax and excise\ntax requirements, as written, could impact\nPNC's cash tax liability.\n\nIn October 2022, the Federal Reserve and FDIC\njointly issued an advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking to solicit input on potential\nchanges to the resolution-related requirements\napplicable to large banking organizations like\nPNC that are not GSIBs. The advance notice of\nproposed rulemaking solicits comments and\nposes specific questions on whether to impose\nGSIB-like resolution requirements on large\nbanking organizations that are not GSIBs,\nincluding a requirement to maintain loss-\nabsorbing capacity at the insured depository\ninstitution or holding company in the form of\nlong-term debt, a \u201cclean holding company\u201d\nrequirement that would prohibit top-tier\nholding companies from entering certain\nfinancial arrangements (such as short-term\nborrowing or derivative contracts), the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s supervisory guidance on\nrecovery planning, separability requirements\nand certain disclosure requirements currently\napplicable to GSIBs.

Our\ndetermination of the ACL is based on\nhistorical loss and performance experience, as\nwell as current borrower and transaction\ncharacteristics including collateral type and\nquality, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply\nqualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our\nbest estimate of amounts that we do not expect\nto collect because\n   38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\nof, among other things, idiosyncratic risk\nfactors, changes in economic conditions that\nmay not be reflected in forecasted results, or\nother potential methodology limitations. The\nmajor drivers of ACL estimates include:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality changes, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC, which also determines and approves\nCECL scenarios' weights for use for the\ncurrent reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 reflect an increase in\ndownside risk compared to December 31, 2021.\nThe current outlook considers the inflationary\npressures that have broadened and intensified\nsince the start of the year, along with the\nfact that the FOMC raised interest rates more\naggressively than what was expected at\nDecember 31, 2021, increasing the risk of a\nbroader-ranged economic slowdown. Though the\nmost-likely expectation continues to be that\nthe U.S. economy narrowly avoids recession,\ngrowth is expected to slow and the primary\ndownside risk to the outlook has shifted from\nthe pandemic to monetary policy tightening and\ninflation.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with two of the most significant\ndrivers being Real GDP and the U.S.\nunemployment rate. The following table\npresents a comparison of these two economic\nvariables based on the weighted-average\nscenario forecasts used in determining our ACL\nat September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\nTable 33: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                   September                  \n                    30, 2022                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. Real             0.2%    0.1%    1.5%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            3.8%    4.8%    4.7%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2021                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n  U.S. Real             2.8%    1.4%    1.3%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.4%    4.1%    3.9%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2022 at\n0.2% on a weighted average basis, down from\nthe 2.8% assumed at December 31, 2021 due\nprimarily to weaker expected growth in the\nsecond half of 2022, along with the unexpected\ncontraction of GDP in the first and second\nquarter of 2022.

of our management, including\nthe Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and the Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and of changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nBased on that evaluation, our Chairman,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and our\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)\nwere effective as of September 30, 2022, and\nthat there has been no change in PNC\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting that\noccurred during the third quarter of 2022 that\nhas materially affected, or is reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations, including our\nsustainability strategy, that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d

numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies\nof the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n\n\u2013 The impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\nand associated sanctions or other actions in\nresponse, on the global and U.S. economy,\n\n\u2013 The length and extent of the economic\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of changes in federal, state and\nlocal governmental policy, including on the\nregulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\n\n\u2013 PNC\u2019s ability to attract, recruit and retain\nskilled employees, and\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 Although real GDP contracted in the first\nand second quarters of 2022, the U.S. economy\nis not in a recession. In particular, the\nlabor market remains extremely strong, with\naverage monthly job growth well above the pre-\npandemic pace, and the unemployment rate at a\n50-year low. Supply-chain difficulties will\ncontinue to ease into 2023. Labor shortages\nwill remain a constraint into 2023, although\nstrong wage growth and high levels of\nhousehold saving will support consumer\nspending.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects economic growth will be below\nits long-term trend in the near term as the\nFederal Reserve continues to tighten monetary\npolicy in an attempt to reduce inflationary\npressures, but does not expect a near-term\nrecession. Recession risks over the next few\nyears are elevated, however, because of\ntighter monetary policy.\n\n\u2013 Inflation has started to slow, but remains\nnear the strongest pace in decades. Inflation\nshould slow further due to softer economic\ngrowth and a continued easing in supply-chain\ndifficulties and will return to the Federal\nReserve's 2% long-run objective in 2024.\n   42 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\n\u2013 The FOMC raised the federal funds rate by\n0.75% in September, to a range of 3.00% to\n3.25%. PNC expects further increases in the\nfederal funds rate through the rest of this\nyear, to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% at the end\nof 2022. PNC expects the federal funds rate to\npeak between 4.50% and 4.75% in early 2023,\nbefore falling in early 2024 as inflation ebbs\nand economic growth slows.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board's CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models and the reliability of and\nrisks resulting from extensive use of such\nmodels.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain employees. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, changes in the enforcement\nand interpretation of such laws and\nregulations, and changes in accounting and\nreporting standards.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other inquiries\nresulting in monetary losses, costs, or\nalterations in our business practices and\npotentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our reputation and business and operating\nresults may be affected by our ability to\nappropriately meet or address environmental,\nsocial or governance targets, goals,\ncommitments or concerns that may arise.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing or\nany failure to execute strategic or\noperational plans.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread manmade, natural and\nother disasters (including severe weather\nevents), health emergencies, dislocations,\ngeopolitical instabilities or events,\nterrorist activities, system failures or\ndisruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks,\ninternational hostilities, or other\nextraordinary events beyond PNC's control\nthrough impacts on the economy and financial\nmarkets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties, customers or third-party\nvendors and service providers specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2021 Form 10-K\nand subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 5.4billion, at September 30, 2022,\nrelated to securities transferred, which are\noffset in AOCI, net of tax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at September 30, 2022\nincluded $ 2.0billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for September 30, 2021\nwas $ 2.4billion.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we transferred\nan additional $ 4.9billion of securities, at\nfair value, from available for sale to held to\nmaturity. The securities transferred included\n$ 3.3billion of U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities and $ 1.6billion of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities. During\nthe first nine months of 2022, we transferred\nsecurities with a fair value of $ 82.7billion\nfrom available for sale to held to maturity.\nThe securities transferred included $\n34.0billion of U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities, $ 39.0billion of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities, $\n6.3billion of asset-backed securities and $\n3.4billion of other securities. The securities\nwere reclassified at fair value at the time of\nthe transfer and the transfers represented\nnon-cash transactions. AOCI at September 30,\n2022 included pretax unrealized losses of $\n5.4billion related to the transfers. These\nunrealized losses will be amortized,\nconsistent with the amortization of the\ndiscount on these securities, over the\nremaining life as an adjustment of yield,\nresulting in no impact to net interest income\nor net income.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At September 30, 2022, the\nallowance for investment securities was $\n140million and primarily related to non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities in the\navailable for sale portfolio. The comparable\namount at\n   52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\nDecember 31, 2021 was $ 133million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies included in Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, AOCI included pretax\nlosses of $ 132million from derivatives that\nhedged the purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 36 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. These securities\nare segregated between investments that had\nbeen in a continuous unrealized loss position\nfor less than twelve months and twelve months\nor more, based on the point in time that the\nfair value declined below the amortized cost\nbasis. All securities included in the table\nhave been evaluated to determine if a credit\nloss exists. As part of that assessment, as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, we concluded that we do\nnot intend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 36: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 40 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We\nmanage credit risk based on the risk profile\nof the borrower, repayment sources, underlying\ncollateral and other support given current\nevents, economic conditions and expectations.\nWe refine our practices to meet the changing\nenvironment resulting from rising inflation\nlevels, supply chain disruptions, higher\nrates, and secular changes fostered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance.

Our continuing involvement in the\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, Non-\nagency securitizations and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing,\nrepurchasing previously transferred loans\nunder certain conditions and loss share\narrangements, and, in limited circumstances,\nholding of mortgage-backed securities issued\nby the securitization SPEs.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 3.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and $ 1.8billion at\nDecember 31, 2021, and consisted of loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential mortgages measured at fair value.\n\nMSRs are subject to changes in value from\nactual or expected prepayment of the\nunderlying loans and defaults, as well as\nmarket driven changes in interest rates. We\nmanage this risk by economically hedging the\nfair value of MSRs with securities, derivative\ninstruments and resale agreements which are\nexpected to increase (or decrease) in value\nwhen the value of MSRs decreases (or\nincreases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 6 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 67\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 52 and 53. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions.\n\nTable 52: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow September 30,\n2022, we expect to reclassify net derivative\nlosses of $ 1.2billion pretax, or $ 1.0billion\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to September 30,\n2022. As of September 30, 2022, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is ten years.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 85\nFurther detail

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting and counterparty credit risk, see\nNote 16 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nTable 74 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nat September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe table includes cash collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements. The table also includes\nthe fair value of any securities collateral\nheld or pledged under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements.

The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house who then becomes our\ncounterparty. OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\nTable 74: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, cash and debt\nsecurities (primarily agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities) totaling $ 2.2billion were pledged\nto us under master netting agreements and\nother collateral agreements to collateralize\nnet derivative assets due from counterparties\nand to meet initial margin requirements, and\nwe pledged cash and debt securities (primarily\nagency mortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n3.9billion under these agreements to\ncollateralize net derivative liabilities owed\nto counterparties and to meet initial margin\nrequirements.

To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions.

Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K, we are unable, at this time,\nto estimate the losses that are reasonably\npossible to be incurred or ranges of such\nlosses with respect to some of the matters\ndisclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount\nprovided above does not include an estimate\nfor every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the\nestimated aggregate amount disclosed above\ndoes not include all of the Disclosed Matters,\nthe amount disclosed above does not represent\nour maximum reasonably possible loss exposure\nfor all of the Disclosed Matters. The\nestimated aggregate amount also does not\nreflect any of our exposure to matters not so\ndisclosed, as discussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 89\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn July 2022, following a jury verdict in\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A. (Case No. 2:20-cv-319) (the \u201cfirst\nTexas case\u201d) and United Services Automobile\nAssociation v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case No.\n2:21-cv-110) (together, \u201cthe first\nconsolidated cases\u201d), the parties submitted\nbriefs on PNC\u2019s remaining equitable defenses.\nIn August 2022, the court denied our request\nfor relief, entered final judgment, declined\nto award enhanced damages for willfulness and\nawarded USAA pre-judgment and applicable post-\njudgment interest. In September 2022, PNC\nfiled its post-trial motions for judgment as a\nmatter of law and for a new trial.\n\nIn September 2022, following a jury trial in\nthe second consolidated cases (representing\nthe case for PNC\u2019s patent infringement\ncounterclaims (originally asserted in the\nfirst Texas case) which was previously\nconsolidated into USAA\u2019s third lawsuit filed\nin July 2021 in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nagainst PNC Bank for patent infringement (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A. (Case No. 2:21-cv-246)) (\u201cthe third\nTexas case\u201d)), a jury found against PNC for\ninfringement of at least one of the two\nasserted patents and awarded $ 4.3million, and\ndetermined that PNC did not willfully infringe\nthe patents. The jury further found that USAA\ndid not infringe any of PNC\u2019s asserted\npatents.\n\nBecause of USAA\u2019s case narrowing in the first\nconsolidated cases, only one of the three\npatents granted inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) by\nthe Patent Trial and Appeal Board was\npresented to the jury in the first\nconsolidated cases. In addition, because of\nUSAA\u2019s case narrowing in the third Texas case,\nonly one of the two patents granted IPR by the\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board was presented to\nthe jury in the third Texas case.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad\n\nrange of issues in our consumer, mortgage,\nbrokerage, securities and other financial\nservices businesses, as well as other aspects\nof our operations. In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n   90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  15 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company.

Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors.\n\nWe have allocated the ALLL and the allowance\nfor unfunded lending related commitments based\non the loan exposures within each business\nsegment\u2019s portfolio.

Average\nbalances of securities are based on amortized\nhistorical cost (excluding adjustments to fair\nvalue, which are included in other assets).\nAverage balances for certain loans and\nborrowed funds accounted for at fair value are\nincluded in noninterest-earning assets and\nnoninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes\nin fair value recorded in Noninterest income.\n\n(b) Loan fees for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were\n$48 million and $54 million, respectively.\nLoan fees for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $146\nmillion and $151 million, respectively.\n\n(c) Interest income calculated as taxable-\nequivalent interest income. To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of\n\ncommon stock repurchases depending on a number\nof factors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative\n\nuses of capital, the potential impact on our\ncredit ratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy\n\nand capital planning processes undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR\nprocess, which includes setting PNC's SCB. The\nSCB framework allows for capital returns in\namounts up to the level of capital in excess\nof the SCB minimum. Consistent with the\nflexibility provided under the SCB framework,\nour Board of Directors has authorized a\nrepurchase structure program of up to 100\nmillion common shares, of which approximately\n53% were still available at September 30,\n2022. Under this framework, PNC expects its\nquarterly repurchases to approximate $700\nmillion to $750 million with the ability to\nadjust those levels as conditions warrant.\n  100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n                                     Form 10-Q\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 6.
