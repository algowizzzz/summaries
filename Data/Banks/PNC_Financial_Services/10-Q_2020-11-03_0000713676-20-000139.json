                      \n       The effective income tax rates are     \n       generally lower than the statutory     \n  (c)  rate due to the relationship of        \n       pretax income to tax credits and       \n       earnings that are not subject to tax.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net interest margin is the

   \n       noninterest-bearing sources. To        \n       provide more meaningful comparisons    \n       of net interest margins, we use net    \n       interest income on a                   \n       taxable-equivalent basis in            \n       calculating average yields used in     \n  (d)  the calculation of net interest        \n       margin by increasing the interest      \n       income earned on tax-exempt assets to  \n       make it fully equivalent to interest   \n       income earned on taxable investments.  \n       This adjustment is not permitted       \n       under GAAP in the Consolidated Income  \n       Statement.

Current\nEconomic Environment The coronavirus\n(COVID-19) pandemic and public health response\nto contain it led to a severe recession in the\nfirst half of 2020, after the U.S. economy\nreached a peak in economic activity in\nFebruary 2020. Most measures of economic\nactivity contracted with enormous declines in\nconsumer spending, employment, retail sales,\nbusiness investment, industrial production and\ncorporate profitability. The unemployment rate\npeaked at 14.7% in April and has declined\nsince then, but still remained elevated at\n7.9% in September. Real GDP growth in the\nthird quarter was extremely strong, at an\nannual rate of 33.1%, after declining\nsignificantly in the first and second quarters\nof 2020. While economic conditions have\nimproved, including a rebound in consumer\nspending and job growth, economic activity\nremains far below its pre-pandemic level.\nThere is still a great deal of uncertainty\nabout the length and severity of the pandemic\nand the strength or reversal of the economic\nrebound, including whether there will be\nadditional fiscal stimulus from the federal\ngovernment and, if so, its size and scope. The\nFederal Reserve has undertaken extraordinary\nefforts to combat the economic weakness,\nreducing the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage\npoints in March to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%.\nThe Federal Reserve implemented multiple\nprograms to support the flow of credit to\nbusinesses, consumers, and state and local\ngovernments, including, for the first time,\ndirect purchases of corporate bonds and of\nbank loans to small and medium-sized\nbusinesses. In addition, the federal\ngovernment authorized $2.4 trillion in federal\nspending to support household incomes and\nbusinesses, including the $1.8 trillion\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security\n(CARES) Act.

Business\nOutlook Our forward-looking financial\nstatements are subject to the risk that\neconomic and financial market conditions will\nbe substantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views, as follow:\n                                              \n     The U.S. economy is in a nascent         \n     economic recovery in the second half of  \n     2020, following a very severe but very   \n     short economic contraction in the first  \n     half of the year due to the COVID-19     \n     pandemic and public health measures to   \n     contain it. Real GDP declined            \n     significantly in the first and second    \n     quarters of 2020, as many firms closed,  \n  \u2022  at least temporarily, and consumers      \n     stayed at home. Since the late           \n     spring/early summer economic activity    \n     has picked up due to loosening           \n     restrictions on businesses, massive      \n     federal stimulus, and extremely low      \n     interest rates. Between May and          \n     September the economy added back         \n     slightly more than half of the 22        \n     million jobs lost in March and April.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Despite the improvement in the economy   \n     in recent months, economic activity      \n     remains far below its pre-pandemic       \n     level and unemployment remains           \n     elevated. Real GDP growth in the third   \n     quarter was extremely strong, at an      \n     annual rate of 33.1%, but will slow in   \n     the fourth quarter and through 2021.     \n  \u2022  PNC does not expect real GDP to return   \n     to its pre-pandemic level until late     \n     2021, and does not expect employment to  \n     return to its pre-pandemic level until   \n     2023. Risks to this outlook are          \n     weighted to the downside; they include   \n     a further resurgence in the spread of    \n     the coronavirus and a lack of            \n     additional stimulus from the federal     \n     government.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Monetary policy remains extremely        \n     supportive of economic growth. PNC       \n  \u2022  expects the Federal Open Market          \n     Committee to keep the federal funds      \n     rate in its current range of 0.00% to    \n     0.25% through at least mid-2024.         \n                                              \nGiven the many unknowns and risks being\nheavily weighted to the downside, our forward-\nlooking statements are subject to the risk\nthat conditions will be substantially\ndifferent than we are currently expecting. If\nefforts to contain COVID-19 are unsuccessful\nand restrictions on businesses and activities\nare not further lifted or are reimposed, the\nrecovery would be much weaker. There is even\nthe potential that the economy could fall back\ninto recession. PNC\u2019s baseline scenario\nassumes additional fiscal stimulus; continued\ninaction on stimulus is another major downside\nrisk. The longer it takes to combat the\npandemic the more permanent damage it will\ncause to business and consumer fundamentals\nand sentiment; this could make the recovery\nweaker and result in permanently lower long-\nrun economic growth. An extended global\nrecession due to COVID-19 would weaken the\nU.S. recovery. As a result, the outbreak and\nits consequences, including responsive\nmeasures to manage it, have had and are likely\nto continue to have an adverse effect,\npossibly materially, on our business and\nfinancial performance by adversely affecting\nthe demand and profitability of our products\nand services, the valuation of assets and our\nability to meet the needs of our customers.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the\nthird quarter of 2020 , we expect:\n                                              \n  \u2022  Average loans to decline in the          \n     low-single digits percentage range;      \n                                              \n                                        \n  \u2022  Net interest income to be stable;  \n                                        \n                                              \n     Fee income to be stable and other        \n     noninterest income to be between $275    \n  \u2022  million and $325 million, resulting in   \n     our expectation that total noninterest   \n     income will be down in the high-single   \n     digit percentage range;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Noninterest expense to be up             \n     approximately 1%; and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Net loan charge-offs to be between $200  \n     million and $250 million.                \n                                              \nFor the full year 2020, we expect to deliver\npositive operating leverage in the range of 3%\nto 4%.

The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 7 Net interest income\ndecreased $20 million , or 1% , and increased\n$ 45 million , or 1% , for the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2020 , respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in 2019 . The\ndecrease in the quarterly comparison was\nattributable to lower yields on interest-\nearning assets, partially offset by lower\nrates on deposits and borrowings and higher\naverage interest-earning assets. In the year-\nto-date comparison, the increase was driven by\nlower rates on deposits, higher average\ninterest-earning assets and lower borrowing\ncosts and balances, partially offset by lower\nyields on interest-earning assets and higher\naverage deposit balances. Net interest margin\ndecreased 45 basis points in the quarterly\ncomparison and 34 basis points in the year-to-\ndate comparison reflecting the reduction in\nthe federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve\nin March 2020 and related changes in other\nshort-term rates which resulted in lower\nyields on loans and securities, partially\noffset by lower rates on deposits and\nborrowings. Additionally, the impact of higher\nbalances held with the Federal Reserve\ncontributed to the margin declines. Average\ninvestment securities increased $ 5.3 billion\n, or 6% , in the quarterly comparison and $\n4.1 billion , or 5% , in the year-to-date\ncomparison. The increases were primarily due\nto increases in agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, partially offset by a\ndecrease in U.S. Treasury and government\nagency securities in the year-to-date\ncomparison. Average investment securities\nrepresented 22% of average interest-earning\nassets for both the third quarter and first\nnine months of 2020 compared to 24% for the\nsame periods in 2019. Average loans grew $15.4\nbillion , or 6% , and $ 21.2 billion , or 9% ,\nin the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively. Loan growth was driven by an\nincrease in both commercial and consumer\nloans. Average commercial loans increased\n$14.2 billion and $17.5 billion in the\nrespective comparisons reflecting broad based\ngrowth including PPP lending under the CARES\nAct and higher utilization of loan commitments\ndriven by the economic impact of the pandemic\non customer liquidity preferences in the year-\nto-date comparison. Average consumer loans\nincreased $1.2 billion and $3.7 billion in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively. Growth in residential mortgage\nand home equity was partially offset by lower\ncredit card, education, and auto loans in the\nquarterly comparison. The year-to-date\ncomparison reflected growth in residential\nmortgage, auto, credit card and unsecured\ninstallment loans, partially offset by a\ndecline in education loans due to runoff in\nthe guaranteed government loan portfolio.\nAverage loans represented 61% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the third quarter\nof 2020 and 65% for the first nine months of\n2020 compared to 67% and 68% for the same\nperiods in 2019, respectively. Average\ninterest-earning deposits with banks increased\n$44.7 billion and $ 22.9 billion in the\nrespective quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons, as average balances held with the\nFederal Reserve Bank increased due to higher\nliquidity from deposit growth and proceeds\nfrom the sale of our equity investment in\nBlackRock. Average interest-bearing deposits\ngrew $41.6 billion , or 20% , and $ 33.8\nbillion , or 17% , in the respective quarterly\nand year-to-date comparisons reflecting\noverall growth in commercial and consumer\ndeposits as well as pandemic-related\naccumulation of customer liquidity. In total,\naverage interest-bearing deposits increased to\n85% and 82% of average interest-bearing\nliabilities for the third quarter and first\nnine months of 2020 compared to 76% for the\nsame periods in 2019. Average borrowed funds\ndecreased $ 20.6 billion, or 32% , compared\nwith the third quarter of 2019 and $ 10.8\nbillion , or 17% , compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2019 primarily due to a decline in\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings\nreflecting the use of liquidity from deposit\ngrowth and proceeds from the sale of our\nequity investment in BlackRock.

Asset management\nrevenue in the year-to-date comparison\ndeclined due to the impact of PNC's\ndivestiture activity in 2019 of the retirement\nrecordkeeping business and PNC's proprietary\nmutual funds partially offset by the impact of\nhigher average equity markets. PNC's\ndiscretionary client assets under management\ndecreased to $158 billion at September 30,\n2020 from $163 billion at September 30, 2019 ,\nprimarily as a result of the fourth quarter\n2019 sale of the proprietary mutual funds.\nConsumer services revenue declined in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons as a\nresult of lower transaction volumes and\nactivity reflecting lower consumer spending.\nService charges on deposits decreased in both\ncomparisons due to lower transaction volumes\nand fees waived for customers experiencing\npandemic-related hardships and lower revenue\nrelated to the elimination of certain checking\nproduct fees. Corporate services revenue in\nthe quarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nincreased due to higher revenue from\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, asset-\nbacked financing fees, loans commitments fees\nand treasury management product revenue,\npartially offset by lower merger and\nacquisition advisory fees. Residential\nmortgage revenue increased in both comparisons\ndue to higher loan sales revenue partially\noffset by lower servicing fees due to\nincreased payoff volumes. Additionally,\nrevenue from residential mortgage servicing\nrights (RMSR) valuation, net of economic\nhedge, was lower in the quarterly comparison\nand higher in the year-to-date comparison.\nOther noninterest income increased in the\nquarterly comparison and included higher\nrevenue from net securities gains, capital\nmarkets-related activities and positive\nvaluation adjustments of private equity\ninvestments. In the year-to-date comparison,\nthe increase was primarily attributable to\nhigher net securities gains and capital\nmarkets-related revenue, partially offset by\nlower revenue from private equity investments\nand lower gains on asset sales, including the\nsecond quarter 2019 divestiture of the\nretirement recordkeeping business.

In the year-to-date\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 9 comparison, personnel and occupancy\nexpenses declined due to variable costs\nassociated with decreased business activity,\npartially offset by higher equipment expense\nrelated to technology investments. Effective\nIncome Tax Rate The effective income tax rate\nfrom continuing operations was 9.8% in the\nthird quarter of 2020 compared to 17.8% in the\nthird quarter of 2019, and 7.6% in the first\nnine months of 2020 compared to 17.0% in the\nsame period in 2019. The decrease in both\ncomparisons was primarily due to tax credit\nbenefits and the favorable resolution of\ncertain tax matters in the third quarter of\n2020.

The\nprovision for credit losses decreased $131\nmillion for the third quarter of 2020 compared\nto the third quarter of 2019 and increased $\n2.9 billion for the first nine months of 2020\ncompared with the same period in 2019. The\nprovision in the 2020 periods was calculated\nunder the CECL accounting standard adopted\nJanuary 1, 2020. The provision for loans and\nleases in the third quarter of 2020 reflected\na provision recapture for consumer loans,\noffset by a provision for expected losses for\ncertain borrowers in industries adversely\nimpacted by the pandemic, primarily within the\ncommercial real estate loan portfolio. In\naddition, the third quarter 2020 provision for\ncredit losses included $39 million related to\ninvestment securities. The higher provision\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2020\nreflected the change in methodology together\nwith the significantly adverse economic impact\nof the pandemic and its resulting effects on\nloan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.\nThe Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of this Financial Review\nincludes additional information regarding\nfactors impacting the provision for credit\nlosses.

Our balance\nsheet was strong and well positioned at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .\n                                              \n     Total assets increased as a result of    \n     higher interest-earning deposits with    \n  \u2022  banks, primarily the Federal Reserve     \n     Bank, loan growth, and higher            \n     investment securities;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Total liabilities increased primarily    \n     due to deposit growth reflecting         \n  \u2022  customer liquidity accumulation,         \n     partially offset by lower FHLB           \n     borrowings and federal funds purchased;  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Total equity increased primarily due to  \n     higher retained earnings driven by the   \n     gain on sale of our equity investment    \n     in BlackRock and higher accumulated      \n  \u2022  other comprehensive income (AOCI),       \n     partially offset by dividends on common  \n     and preferred stock, share repurchases,  \n     the day-one effect of adopting the CECL  \n     accounting standard and the redemption   \n     of our Series Q preferred stock.         \n                                              \nThe ACL related to loans totaled $6.4 billion\nat September 30, 2020, an increase of $3.3\nbillion since December 31, 2019. The increase\nwas attributable to a $.6 billion day-one CECL\ntransition adjustment and a $3.3 billion\nprovision for credit losses, partially offset\nby net charge-offs of $.6 billion. The\nprovision reflects the significantly adverse\neconomic impact of the pandemic and its\nresulting effects on loan portfolio credit\nquality and loan growth.

For commercial and industrial loans\nby industry and commercial real estate loans\nby geography and property type, see Loan\nPortfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the\nCredit Risk Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of this Financial Review.\nTotal consumer loans declined as new\noriginations decreased due to the economic\nimpact of the pandemic and lower consumer\nspending. Residential mortgage loans increased\nas the low interest rate environment resulted\nin an increase in origination volumes\nprimarily of nonconforming loans, which are\nloans that do not meet agency standards as a\nresult of exceeding agency conforming loan\nlimits.

For additional information\nregarding our loan portfolio see Note 1\nAccounting Policies and Note 4 Loans and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Report. Investment Securities\nInvestment securities of $91.2 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 increased $4.4 billion , or\n5% , compared to December 31, 2019 , due\nprimarily to net purchases and an increase in\nthe fair value of agency residential mortgage-\nbacked and U.S. Treasury securities. The level\nand composition of the investment securities\nportfolio fluctuates over time based on many\nfactors including market conditions, loan and\ndeposit growth, and balance sheet management\nactivities. We manage our investment\nsecurities portfolio to optimize returns,\nwhile providing a reliable source of liquidity\nfor our banking and other activities,\nconsidering the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nand other internal and external guidelines and\nconstraints.

We have included credit ratings\ninformation because we believe that the\ninformation is an indicator of the degree of\ncredit risk to which we are exposed. Changes\nin credit ratings classifications could\nindicate increased or decreased credit risk\nand could be accompanied by a reduction or\nincrease in the fair value of our investment\nsecurities portfolio. We continually monitor\nthe credit risk in our portfolio and maintain\nthe allowance for securities at an appropriate\nlevel to absorb expected credit losses on our\ninvestment securities portfolio for the\nremaining contractual term of the securities\nadjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies and Note 3 Investment\nSecurities in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional details\nregarding the methodology for determining the\nallowance and the amount of the allowance for\ninvestment securities, respectively. The\nduration of investment securities was 2.2\nyears at September 30, 2020 . We estimate that\nat September 30, 2020 the effective duration\nof investment securities was 2.7 years for an\nimmediate 50 basis points parallel increase in\ninterest rates and 1.7 years for an immediate\n50 basis points parallel decrease in interest\nrates.

Shareholders\u2019 Equity Total\nshareholders\u2019 equity was $53.3 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 , an increase of $4.0\nbillion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2019.\nThe increase resulted from net income of $6.1\nbillion, which included the gain on sale of\nour equity investment in BlackRock, and higher\nAOCI of $2.2 billion , partially offset by\ncommon and preferred stock dividends of $1.7\nbillion, common share repurchases of $1.4\nbillion, a day-one transition adjustment of\n$.7 billion for the adoption of the CECL\naccounting standard and $.5 billion for the\nredemption of our Series Q preferred stock.\nPNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary\nsuspension of our common stock repurchase\nprogram in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve's effort to support the U.S. economy\nduring the pandemic, and will continue the\nsuspension through the fourth quarter of 2020,\nconsistent with the extension of the Federal\nReserve's special capital distribution\nrestrictions.

Certain\namounts included in this Business Segments\nReview differ from those amounts shown in Note\n15 , primarily due to the presentation in this\nFinancial Review of business net interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis. During\nthe second quarter of 2020, we divested our\nentire 22.4% investment in BlackRock. See Note\n2 Discontinued Operations in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this\nReport for additional information on the sale\nand details on our results and cash flows for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30,\n2020 and 2019. Following the sale and\ndonation, PNC only holds shares of BlackRock\nstock in a fiduciary capacity for clients of\nPNC. Net interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors. Total business segment financial\nresults differ from total consolidated net\nincome. The impact of these differences is\nreflected in the \u201cOther\u201d category as shown in\nTable 81 in Note 15 Segment Reporting in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nthis Report. \u201cOther\u201d includes residual\nactivities that do not meet the criteria for\ndisclosure as a separate reportable business,\nsuch as asset and liability management\nactivities including net securities gains or\nlosses, ACL for investment securities, certain\ntrading activities, certain runoff consumer\nloan portfolios, private equity investments,\nintercompany eliminations, certain corporate\noverhead, tax adjustments that are not\nallocated to business segments, exited\nbusinesses and differences between business\nsegment performance reporting and financial\nstatement reporting (GAAP), including the\npresentation of net income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests as the segments\u2019\nresults exclude their portion of net income\nattributable to noncontrolling interests. See\nthe Executive Summary of this Financial Review\nfor our discussion of the impact of pandemic-\nrelated developments on our business and\noperations, including pandemic relief efforts\nfor our customers.

million for the same period in 2019 . The\ndecrease in earnings was attributable to a\nhigher provision for credit losses and\nincreased noninterest expense partially offset\nby higher net interest income and noninterest\nincome. Net interest income increased\nprimarily due to growth in loan and deposit\nbalances, partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on the value of loans\nand deposits. Noninterest income increased\nlargely due to growth in residential mortgage\nrevenue attributable to increased loan sales\nrevenue and higher revenue from residential\nmortgage servicing rights valuation, net of\neconomic hedge, partially offset by lower\nservicing fees. The increase in noninterest\nincome was partially offset by a decrease in\nservice charges on deposits and consumer\nservices fees reflecting lower transaction\nvolumes, fees waived to assist customers in\nthe pandemic, lower consumer spending and the\nelimination of certain checking product fees.\nThe increase in noninterest income was also\ndriven by lower negative derivative fair value\nadjustments related to Visa Class B common\nshares of $22 million for the first nine\nmonths of 2020 compared with the negative\nadjustments of $55 million for the same period\nin 2019. The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 17 Provision for credit\nlosses increased in the first nine months of\n2020 compared to the same period in 2019\nreflecting changes in methodology due to the\nadoption of the CECL accounting standard,\ntogether with the significantly adverse\neconomic impact of the pandemic. Higher\nnoninterest expense primarily resulted from\nhigher personnel, branch related expenses due\nin part to the impact of the pandemic, and\nequipment, partially offset by lower\nadvertising and marketing. The deposit\nstrategy of Retail Banking is to remain\ndisciplined on pricing and focused on growing\nand retaining relationship-based balances,\nexecuting on market-specific deposit growth\nstrategies and providing a source of low-cost\nfunding and liquidity to PNC. In the first\nnine months of 2020 , average total deposits\nincreased compared to the same period in 2019\nprimarily driven by growth in demand and\nsavings deposits which increased due, in part,\nto a shift from money market deposits to\nrelationship-based savings products. Savings\nand demand deposits also benefited from the\nimpact of government stimulus payments and\nlower consumer spending due to the pandemic.\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin the first nine months of 2020 compared with\nthe same period in 2019 .\n                                              \n     Average residential mortgages increased  \n     primarily as a result of growth in       \n  \u2022  nonconforming residential mortgage       \n     loans and a robust refinance market      \n     driven by historically low interest      \n     rates.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Average commercial loans increased       \n     primarily due to PPP loans.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average auto loans increased primarily   \n  \u2022  due to new indirect auto loan volumes,   \n     including in our Southeast and           \n     expansion markets.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average credit card balances increased   \n     as we continued to focus on our          \n  \u2022  long-term objective of deepening         \n     penetration within our existing          \n     customer base as well as new client      \n     acquisition.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average unsecured installment loans      \n  \u2022  increased primarily driven by growth in  \n     originations through digital channels.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average home equity loans increased as   \n  \u2022  new originated volume exceeded paydowns  \n     and payoffs on loans.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Average education loans decreased        \n  \u2022  driven by a decline in the runoff        \n     portfolio of government guaranteed       \n     education loans.                         \n                                              \nIn 2018, we launched our national expansion\nstrategy designed to grow customers with\ndigitally-led banking and a thin branch\nnetwork in markets outside of our existing\nretail branch network and began offering a\ndigital high yield savings deposit product and\nopened our first solution center in Kansas\nCity.

Net interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to higher average\nloan and deposit balances and wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of loans, partially\noffset by narrower interest rate spreads on\nthe value of deposits. Growth in noninterest\nincome in the comparison reflected broad-based\nincreases including higher capital markets-\nrelated revenue, revenue from commercial\nmortgage banking activities and treasury\nmanagement product revenue. Provision for\ncredit losses increased in the first nine\nmonths of 2020 compared to the same period in\n2019, primarily reflecting changes in\nmethodology due to the adoption of the CECL\naccounting standard, together with the\nsignificantly adverse economic impact of the\npandemic and its resulting effects on loan\nportfolio credit quality. Nonperforming assets\nat September 30, 2020 and net loan and lease\ncharge offs for the first nine months of 2020\nincreased over the comparative periods of\n2019, primarily related to industries\nadversely impacted by the pandemic and the\nenergy industry. Noninterest expense decreased\nin the comparison largely due to lower\nvariable costs associated with decreased\nbusiness activity related to the pandemic\npartially offset by investments in strategic\ninitiatives.

R ISK M ANAGEMENT The Risk\nManagement section included in Item 7 of our\n2019 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk\nmanagement framework including risk culture,\nenterprise strategy, risk governance and\nframework, risk identification, risk\nassessment, risk controls and monitoring, and\nrisk aggregation and reporting. Additionally,\nour 2019 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our\nkey areas of risk, which include but are not\nlimited to credit, liquidity and capital,\nmarket, operational, compliance and\ninformation security. Credit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with contractual terms.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business and results from extending\ncredit to customers, purchasing securities,\nand entering into financial derivative\ntransactions and certain guarantee contracts.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant\nrisks. Our processes for managing credit risk\nare designed to be embedded in our risk\nculture and in our decision-making processes\nusing a systematic approach whereby credit\nrisks and related exposures are identified and\nassessed, managed through specific policies\nand processes, measured and evaluated against\nour risk appetite and credit concentration\nlimits, and reported, along with specific\nmitigation activities, to management and the\nBoard of Directors through our governance\nstructure. Our most significant concentration\nof credit risk is in our loan portfolio. The\nPNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n23 Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis\nTable 15 : Details of Loans In billions We use\nseveral credit quality indicators, as further\ndetailed in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance\nfor Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in this Report, to\nmonitor and measure our exposure to credit\nrisk within our loan portfolio. The following\nprovides additional information about our\nsignificant loan classes. Commercial\nCommercial and Industrial Commercial and\nindustrial loans comprised 55% and 52% of our\ntotal loan portfolio at September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. The majority\nof our commercial and industrial loans are\nsecured by collateral that provides a\nsecondary source of repayment for the loan\nshould the borrower experience cash generation\ndifficulties. Examples of this collateral\ninclude short-term assets, such as accounts\nreceivable, inventory and securities, and\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment, real\nestate and other business assets. We actively\nmanage our commercial and industrial loans to\nassess any changes (both positive and\nnegative) in the level of credit risk at both\nthe borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate\nthe level of credit risk, we assign internal\nrisk ratings reflecting our estimates of the\nborrower\u2019s probability of default (PD) and\nloss given default (LGD) for each related\ncredit facility. This two-dimensional credit\nrisk rating methodology provides granularity\nin the risk monitoring process and is updated\non an ongoing basis through our credit risk\nmanagement processes. In addition to\nmonitoring the level of credit risk, we also\nmonitor concentrations of credit risk\npertaining to both specific industries and\ngeography that may exist in our portfolio.

See\nthe Commercial High Impact Industries\ndiscussion within this Credit Risk Management\nsection for additional discussion of the\nimpact of COVID-19 on our commercial portfolio\nand how we are evaluating and monitoring the\nportfolio for elevated levels of credit risk.\nCommercial Real Estate Commercial real estate\nloans comprised $17.5 billion related to\ncommercial mortgages, $6.8 billion of real\nestate project loans and $4.7 billion of\nintermediate term financing loans as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 . Comparable amounts were\n$17.0 billion , $5.6 billion and $5.5 billion\n, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 . We\nmonitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith these types of credit activities tend to\nbe correlated to the loan structure,\ncollateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk. The portfolio is geographically\ndiverse due to the nature of our business\ninvolving clients throughout the U.S. The\nfollowing table presents our commercial real\nestate loans by geography and property type.\nTable 17 : Commercial Real Estate Loans by\nGeography and Property Type\n                                              \n         Se\u2026                   D\u2026             \n         30,                   3\u2026             \n         20\u2026                   2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                 %                    %   \n  in     Am\u2026         of        A\u2026         of  \n  m\u2026                 To\u2026                  T\u2026  \n  G\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026  $  4,\u2026     15  %      $  4\u2026     16  %   \n  F\u2026     2,\u2026     10            2\u2026      9      \n  T\u2026     1,\u2026      7            1\u2026      6      \n  M\u2026     1,\u2026      6            1\u2026      7      \n  V\u2026     1,\u2026      6            1\u2026      6      \n  P\u2026     1,\u2026      5            1\u2026      4      \n  O\u2026     1,\u2026      4            1\u2026      4      \n  N\u2026     1,\u2026      4            1\u2026      4      \n  J\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026     968      3            1\u2026      4      \n  N\u2026     957      3            1\u2026      4      \n  C\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026     10\u2026     37            1\u2026     36      \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026  $  29\u2026    100  %      $  2\u2026    100  %   \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026  $  9,\u2026     34  %      $  9\u2026     32  %   \n  O\u2026     7,\u2026     26            7\u2026     27      \n  R\u2026     3,\u2026     12            3\u2026     13      \n  I\u2026     2,\u2026      7            2\u2026      7      \n  H\u2026     1,\u2026      7            1\u2026      7      \n  S\u2026     1,\u2026      5            1\u2026      4      \n  H\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026     905      3            9\u2026      3      \n  U\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026     1,\u2026      6            1\u2026      7      \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  r\u2026  $  29\u2026    100  %      $  2\u2026    100  %   \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Presented in descending order based    \n       on loan balances atSeptember\u00a030,       \n  (a)  2020.                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nCommercial High Impact Industries In light of\nthe current economic circumstances related to\nCOVID-19, we are evaluating and monitoring our\nentire commercial portfolio for elevated\nlevels of credit risk;

For internal reporting and risk\nmanagement we also segment the population into\npools based on product type ( e.g. , home\nequity loans, brokered home equity loans, home\nequity lines of credit, brokered home equity\nlines of credit). As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon the loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien\nposition and geographic concentration. The\ncredit quality of newly originated loans over\nthe last twelve months was strong overall with\na weighted-average LTV on originations of 67%\nand a weighted-average FICO score of 773 . The\ncredit performance of the majority of the home\nequity portfolio where we hold the first lien\nposition is superior to the portion of the\nportfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse an industry-leading third-party service\nprovider to obtain updated loan information,\nincluding lien and collateral data that is\naggregated from public and private sources. 26\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q The following table presents our home\nequity loans by geography and lien type.

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. The originated\nnonconforming residential mortgage portfolio\nhad strong credit quality at September 30,\n2020 with an average original LTV of 69% and\nan average original FICO score of 774 . Our\nportfolio of originated nonconforming\nresidential mortgage loans totaled $17.9\nbillion at September 30, 2020 with 41% located\nin California. Automobile Within auto loans, $\n13.4 billion resided in the indirect auto\nportfolio while $ 1.6 billion were in the\ndirect auto portfolio as of September 30, 2020\n. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2019\nwere $15.1 billion and $1.7 billion ,\nrespectively. The indirect auto portfolio\npertains to loans originated through\nfranchised dealers, including from expansion\ninto new markets. This business is\nstrategically aligned with our core retail\nbanking business. We continue to focus on\nborrowers with strong credit profiles as\nevidenced by a weighted-average loan\norigination FICO score over the last twelve\nmonths of 777 for indirect auto loans and 769\nfor direct auto loans. The weighted-average\nterm of loan originations over the last twelve\nmonths was 72 months for indirect auto loans\nand 62 months for direct auto loans. We offer\nboth new and used auto financing to customers\nthrough our various channels. At September 30,\n2020 , the portfolio was composed of 56% new\nvehicle loans and 44% used vehicle loans.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were\n55% and 45%, respectively. The auto loan\nportfolio's performance is measured monthly,\nincluding updated collateral values that are\nobtained monthly and updated FICO scores that\nare obtained at least quarterly. For internal\nreporting and risk management, we analyze the\nportfolio by product channel and product type\nand regularly evaluate default and delinquency\nexperience. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we segment the\nportfolio by loan structure, collateral\nattributes and credit metrics which include\nFICO score, LTV and term. Nonperforming Assets\nand Loan Delinquencies Nonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming\nloans and leases for which ultimate\ncollectability of the full amount of\ncontractual principal and interest is not\nprobable and include nonperforming troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate\nowned (OREO) and foreclosed assets. Loans held\nfor sale, certain government insured or\nguaranteed loans and loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option are excluded from\nnonperforming loans. Amounts as of December\n31, 2019 also excluded purchased impaired\nloans as we were accreting interest income\nover the expected life of the loans. In\nconnection with the adoption of the CECL\nstandard, nonperforming loans as of September\n30, 2020 include purchased credit deteriorated\n(PCD) loans which meet the criteria to be\nclassified as nonperforming.

As of September 30, 2020 , commercial\nnonperforming loans were carried at\napproximately 78% of their unpaid principal\nbalance, due to charge-offs and interest\napplied to principal, before consideration of\nthe ALLL. Within consumer nonperforming loans,\nresidential real estate TDRs comprised 69% and\n79% of total residential real estate\nnonperforming loans at September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively, while home\nequity TDRs comprised 44% and 49% of home\nequity nonperforming loans at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively.\nTDRs generally remain in nonperforming status\nuntil a borrower has made at least six\nconsecutive months of both principal and\ninterest payments under the modified terms or\nultimate resolution occurs. Loans where\nborrowers have been discharged from personal\nliability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and\nhave not formally reaffirmed their loan\nobligations to us and loans to borrowers not\ncurrently obligated to make both principal and\ninterest payments under the restructured terms\nare not returned to accrual status. Loans that\nhave been restructured for COVID-19 related\nhardships and meet certain criteria under the\nCARES Act are not identified as TDRs. Refer to\nthe Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications discussion in this Credit Risk\nManagement section for more information on the\ntreatment of loan modifications under the\nCARES Act. The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 29 At September 30, 2020 ,\nour largest nonperforming asset was $ 142\nmillion in the Real Estate and Rental and\nLeasing industry and the ten largest\nindividual nonperforming assets represented\n21% of total nonperforming assets. Loan\nDelinquencies We regularly monitor the level\nof loan delinquencies and believe these levels\nmay be a key indicator of credit quality in\nour loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency\nstatus is based on the contractual terms of\neach loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past\ndue in terms of payment are considered\ndelinquent. Loan delinquencies include\ngovernment insured or guaranteed loans, loans\naccounted for under the fair value option and\nat September 30, 2020 also include PCD loans.\nAmounts exclude loans held for sale, while\namounts as of December 31, 2019 also excluded\npurchased impaired loans. Pursuant to the\ninteragency guidance issued in April 2020 and\nin connection with the credit reporting rules\nfrom the CARES Act, the September 30, 2020\ndelinquency status of loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships aligns with the\nrules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows:\n                                              \n     if current at the time of modification,  \n  \u2022  the loan remains current throughout the  \n     modification period,                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     if delinquent at the time of             \n     modification and the borrower was not    \n  \u2022  made current as part of the              \n     modification, the loan maintains its     \n     reported delinquent status during the    \n     modification period, or                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     if delinquent at the time of             \n     modification and the borrower was made   \n  \u2022  current as part of the modification or   \n     became current during the modification   \n     period, the loan is reported as          \n     current.                                 \n                                              \nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of September 30, 2020\nbased on the contractual terms of the loan,\neven where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period. Loan modifications due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships that permanently\nreduce either the contractual interest rate or\nthe principal balance of a loan do not qualify\nfor TDR relief under the CARES Act or the\ninteragency guidance.

Troubled\nDebt Restructurings and Loan Modifications\nTroubled Debt Restructurings A TDR is a loan\nwhose terms have been restructured in a manner\nthat grants a concession to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulties. TDRs\nresult from our loss mitigation activities and\ninclude rate reductions, principal\nforgiveness, postponement/reduction of\nscheduled amortization and extensions, which\nare intended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that meet certain\ncriteria under the CARES Act are not\ncategorized as TDRs. 30 The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q Table 23 :\nSummary of Troubled Debt Restructurings (a)\n                                              \n          S\u2026       D\u2026                         \n          3\u2026       3\u2026       Ch\u2026               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $        %                         \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  3\u2026    $   57       16  %   \n  \u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026       (1\u2026  )    (\u2026  )%  \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  (98  )    (6  )%  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  8\u2026    $  8\u2026    $   (7  )    (1  )%  \n  \u2026       7\u2026       8\u2026       (91  )    (\u2026  )%  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  (98  )    (6  )%  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  (a)  Amounts in table do not include        \n       associated valuation allowances.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Accruing loans include consumer        \n       credit card loans and loans that have  \n  (b)  demonstrated a period of at least six  \n       months of performance under the        \n       restructured terms and are excluded    \n       from nonperforming loans.              \n                                              \nNonperforming TDRs represented approximately\n40% and 52% of total nonperforming loans at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively, and 53% and 51% of total TDRs at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively.

Under the CARES Act,\nloan modifications meeting certain criteria\nqualify the loan for relief from TDR\ntreatment.

Loans that\nare permanently modified or receive longer\nterm modifications under programs involving a\nchange to loan terms due to customer financial\ndifficulty and PNC concessions are evaluated\nfor TDR accounting. For additional information\non the CARES Act and interagency guidance, see\nthe Recent Regulatory Developments section in\nItem 2 of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nThe impact of these modifications was\nconsidered within the quarterly reserve\ndetermination. See the Allowance for Credit\nLosses discussion within the Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments section of\nthis Financial Review for additional\ninformation. Refer to the Loan Delinquencies\ndiscussion in this Credit Risk Management\nsection for information on how these hardship\nrelated loan modifications are reported from a\ndelinquency perspective as of September 30,\n2020. Commercial Loan and Lease Modifications\nUnder COVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs PNC is\ngranting temporary loan and lease\nmodifications to our commercial clients in the\nform of principal and/or interest (payment)\ndeferrals, covenant waivers and other types of\nmodifications, including term extensions. We\nanalyze and make decisions on these\nmodifications based on each individual\nborrower's situation. Initial payment\ndeferrals are typically offered with terms up\nto 90 days. As noted in our second quarter\n2020 Form 10-Q, we had granted deferrals on\nnearly 16,000 commercial accounts representing\napproximately $6.8 billion in hardship relief\nassistance through June 30, 2020. We have\ncontinued to selectively grant payment\ndeferrals in the third quarter of 2020,\nalthough the volume of this activity has\ndeclined considerably from earlier in the\nyear. Following the expiration of these\ninitial deferral periods, we have also noted a\nlow volume of clients requesting subsequent\nassistance. As of September 30, 2020,\nsubsequent deferrals were minimal in our\ncommercial hardship relief programs.

As\nnoted in our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, we\nhad granted assistance on approximately\n242,000 consumer accounts representing\napproximately $6.1 billion in hardship relief\nassistance through June 30, 2020. We continue\nto offer options to our customers in response\nto hardship that extended beyond the initial\nrelief period, but have seen a notable decline\nin requests for assistance from the peak this\nsummer. The following table provides a summary\nof consumer accounts in active assistance\nunder hardship relief programs that were on\nour balance sheet at September 30, 2020 . We\nhave excluded government insured or guaranteed\nloans totaling $491 million and $268 million\nin the Residential real estate and Education\nloan classes, respectively, from Table 25 as\nthese loans present minimal credit risk to\nPNC. 32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\u2013 Form 10-Q Table 25 : Consumer Loans in\nActive Hardship Relief Programs (a) (b)\n                                              \n  As                                          \n  of                                          \n  Se\u2026                                   %     \n  30,                                Mak\u2026     \n  20\u2026                                Pay\u2026     \n  -                         % of       in     \n  Do\u2026    Num\u2026       Unp\u2026    Loan     Last     \n  in       of       Pri\u2026    Cla\u2026     Pay\u2026     \n  mi\u2026    Acc\u2026       Bal\u2026     (c)     Cyc\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  Ho\u2026    1,5\u2026    $   152      .6  %  62.6  %  \n  eq\u2026                                         \n  Re\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026    3,4\u2026       1,1\u2026     5.2  %  44.6  %  \n  es\u2026                                         \n  Au\u2026    13,\u2026        361     2.4  %  71.7  %  \n  Cr\u2026    6,4\u2026         50      .8  %  65.6  %  \n  ca\u2026                                         \n  Ed\u2026    2,6\u2026         39     1.3  %  13.5  %  \n  Ot\u2026    2,9\u2026         41      .8  %  68.2  %  \n  co\u2026                                         \n  To\u2026                                         \n  co\u2026    31,\u2026    $  1,8\u2026     2.4  %  62.3  %  \n  (d)                                         \n                                              \n(a) In cases where there have been multiple\nmodifications on an individual loan,\nregardless of the number of modifications\ngranted, each loan is counted only once in\nthis table. (b) Amounts include loan\nmodifications that qualify for TDR accounting\ntotaling $170 million. (c) Based on total\nloans outstanding at September 30, 2020. (d)\nApproximately 93% of these loans were secured\nby collateral at September 30, 2020.\nModifications are considered to have exited\nactive assistance after the modification\nperiod has expired or the modification was\nexited. As of September 30, 2020,\napproximately 96% of the accruing consumer\nloans that have exited hardship relief program\nmodifications were current or less than 30\ndays past due. The initial consumer loan\nmodifications granted in response to the\nCOVID-19 outbreak and the surrounding economic\ncircumstances were short-term and temporary in\nnature and generally meet the qualifications\nfor relief from TDR treatment under the CARES\nAct. However, in response to customers'\nhardships that have extended beyond the\ninitial relief period, PNC has offered options\nto customers which include both temporary and\npermanent modifications that may reduce the\npayment, the interest rate or extend the term\nand/or defer principal and interest payments.\nPermanent modifications would not meet the\nqualifications for relief from TDR treatment\nunder the CARES Act. Allowance for Credit\nLosses On January 1, 2020 we adopted the CECL\nstandard which replaced the incurred loss\nmethodology for our credit related reserves\nwith an expected credit loss methodology for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term of\nin-scope assets and off-balance sheet\nexposures. Our ACL is based on historical loss\nexperience, borrower characteristics, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future conditions and\nother relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at\nan appropriate level for expected losses on\nour existing investment securities, loans,\nfinance leases, trade receivables and other\nfinancial assets and off-balance sheet credit\nexposures and determine this allowance based\non quarterly assessments of the remaining\nestimated contractual term of the assets or\nexposures as of the balance sheet date.\nExpected losses are estimated using a\ncombination of (i) the expected losses over a\nreasonable and supportable forecast period\n(RSFP), (ii) a period of reversion to long run\naverage expected losses (reversion period)\nwhere applicable, and (iii) long run average\n(LRA) expected losses for the remaining\nestimated contractual term. We use forward-\nlooking information in estimating expected\ncredit losses for the RSFP. For this purpose,\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year reasonable and supportable\nforecast period and the use of four economic\nscenarios and associated probability weights,\nwhich in combination create a forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes over our RSFP of\nthree years. Forward looking information, such\nas forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, is incorporated into the expected\ncredit loss estimates using quantitative\ntechniques, as well as through analysis from\nPNC's economists and management\u2019s judgment in\nqualitatively assessing the ACL. The reversion\nperiod is used to bridge RSFP and LRA expected\ncredit losses. We may consider a number of\nfactors in determining the duration of the\nreversion period, such as contractual maturity\nof the asset, observed historical patterns and\nthe estimated credit loss rates at the end of\nRSFP relative to the beginning of the LRA\nperiod. The LRA expected credit losses are\nderived from our available historical credit\ninformation. We use LRA expected loss for the\nportfolio for the estimated remaining\ncontractual term beyond the RSFP and reversion\nperiod. The following discussion provides\nadditional information related to our reserves\nunder CECL for loans and leases as well as\nunfunded lending related commitments. See Note\n1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this\nReport for further discussion on our ACL,\nincluding details of our methodologies and\ndiscussion of the allowances for investment\nsecurities and other financial assets. See\nalso the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section of this Financial Review The\nPNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n33 for further discussion of the assumptions\nused in the determination of the ACL.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses Our pooled\nexpected loss methodology is based upon the\nquantification of PD, LGD, exposure at default\n(EAD) and the remaining estimated contractual\nterm for a loan or loan segment. We also\nconsider the impact of prepayments and\namortization on contractual maturity in our\nexpected loss estimates. We use historical\ndata, current borrower characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables in quantitative\nmethods to estimate these risk parameters by\nloan or loan segments. PDs represent a\nquantification of risk that a borrower may not\nbe able to pay their contractual obligation\nover a defined period of time. LGD describes\nthe estimate of potential loss if a borrower\nwere to default, and EAD (or utilization rates\nfor revolving loans) is the estimated balance\noutstanding at the time of default and\nexpected loss. These parameters are calculated\nfor each forecasted scenario, and are combined\nto generate expected loss estimates by\nscenario in proportion to the scenario\nweights. We use a discounted cash flow\nmethodology for our consumer real estate\nrelated loan classes and for certain\ncommercial and consumer TDR loans. For non-TDR\nresidential real estate loans and lines, we\ndetermine effective interest rates considering\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for\nprepayments and market interest rates. We then\ndetermine the net present value of expected\ncash flows and ALLL by discounting contractual\ncash flows adjusted for both prepayments and\nexpected credit losses using the effective\ninterest rates. We establish individually\nassessed reserves for loans and leases that do\nnot share similar risk characteristics with a\npool of loans using methods prescribed by\nGAAP. Reserves for individual commercial\nnonperforming loans and commercial TDRs\nexceeding a defined dollar threshold are based\non an analysis of the present value of the\nloan\u2019s expected future cash flows or the fair\nvalue of the collateral, if appropriate under\nour policy for collateral dependent loans.\nCommercial loans that are below the defined\nthreshold and accruing TDRs are collectively\nreserved for, as we believe these loans\ncontinue to share similar risk\ncharacteristics. For consumer nonperforming\nloans classified as collateral dependent,\ncharge-off and ALLL related to recovery of\namounts previously charged-off are evaluated\nthrough an analysis of the fair value of the\ncollateral less costs to sell. While our\nreserve methodologies strive to reflect all\nrelevant credit risk factors, there continues\nto be uncertainty associated with, but not\nlimited to, potential imprecision in the\nestimation process due to the inherent time\nlag of obtaining information and normal\nvariations between expected and actual\noutcomes. We may hold additional reserves that\nare designed to provide coverage for losses\nattributable to such risks. A portion of the\nallowance is related to qualitative\nmeasurement factors.

Liquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity risk, including our liquidity\nmonitoring measures and tools, is described in\nfurther detail in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement section of our 2019 Form 10-K. One\nof the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity\nrequirement designed to ensure that covered\nbanking organizations maintain an adequate\nlevel of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs\nover the course of a hypothetical 30-day\nstress scenario. The LCR is calculated by\ndividing the amount of an institution\u2019s high\nquality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as\ndefined and calculated in accordance with the\nLCR rules, by its estimated, weighted net cash\noutflows, with net cash outflows determined by\napplying the assumed outflow factors in the\nLCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed\nas a percentage. Effective January 1, 2020,\nPNC and PNC Bank, as Category III institutions\nunder the Tailoring Rules, were subject to a\nreduced LCR requirement, with each company's\nnet outflows reduced by 15%, thereby reducing\nthe amount of HQLA each institution must hold\nto meet the LCR minimum requirement. The\nminimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required\nto 36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q maintain continues to be 100%. PNC\nand PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as\nof September 30, 2020 , the LCR for PNC and\nPNC Bank exceeded the requirement of 100%. We\nprovide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2019 Form 10-K. Sources\nof Liquidity Our largest source of liquidity\non a consolidated basis is the customer\ndeposit base generated by our banking\nbusinesses. These deposits provide relatively\nstable and low-cost funding. Total deposits\nincreased to $ 355.1 billion at September 30,\n2020 from $288.5 billion at December 31, 2019\n, driven by growth in both interest-bearing\nand noninterest-bearing deposits.

Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position. At September 30, 2020 ,\nour liquid assets consisted of cash and due\nfrom banks and short-term investments (federal\nfunds sold, resale agreements, trading\nsecurities and interest-earning deposits with\nbanks) totaling $ 80.0 billion and securities\navailable for sale totaling $ 89.7 billion.\nThe level of liquid assets fluctuates over\ntime based on many factors, including market\nconditions, loan and deposit growth and\nbalance sheet management activities. Our\nliquid assets included $ 23.2 billion of\nsecurities available for sale and trading\nsecurities pledged as collateral to secure\npublic and trust deposits, repurchase\nagreements and for other purposes. In\naddition, $.1 billion of securities held to\nmaturity were also pledged as collateral for\nthese purposes. We also obtain liquidity\nthrough various forms of funding, including\nlong-term debt (senior notes, subordinated\ndebt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term\nborrowings (securities sold under repurchase\nagreements, commercial paper and other short-\nterm borrowings). See Note 8 Borrowed Funds in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements, the Funding Sources section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet Review in this\nReport and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in Item 8 of\nour 2019 Form 10-K for additional information\nrelated to our borrowings. Total senior and\nsubordinated debt, on a consolidated basis,\ndecreased due to the following activity: Table\n28 : Senior and Subordinated Debt\n                                    \n  In billions              2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January\u00a01             $  35.1     \n  Issuances                 3.5     \n  Calls and maturities     (6.6  )  \n  Other                     1.3     \n  September 30          $  33.3     \n                                    \nBank Liquidity Under PNC Bank\u2019s 2014 bank note\nprogram, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to\ntime offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding at any one time\nof its unsecured senior and subordinated notes\nwith maturity dates more than nine months (in\nthe case of senior notes) and five years or\nmore (in the case of subordinated notes) from\ntheir date of issue. At September 30, 2020 ,\nPNC Bank had $ 21.6 billion of notes\noutstanding under this program of which $ 16.6\nbillion were senior bank notes and $ 5.0\nbillion were subordinated bank notes. PNC Bank\nmaintains additional secured borrowing\ncapacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through\nthe Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The\nFederal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed\nas a primary means of funding our routine\nbusiness activities, but rather as a potential\nsource of liquidity in a stressed environment\nor during a market disruption. At September\n30, 2020 , our unused secured borrowing\ncapacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the\nFederal Reserve Bank totaled $ 79.4 billion.\nThe Federal Reserve also has established\ncertain special liquidity facilities under its\nemergency lending authority in Section 13(3)\nof the Federal Reserve Act in response to the\neconomic impact of the pandemic. For\nadditional information on these special\nliquidity facilities see the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section of the first quarter 2020\nForm 10-Q and second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of September 30, 2020\n, there were no issuances outstanding under\nthis program. Parent Company Liquidity In\naddition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 37 parent company maintains adequate\nliquidity to fund discretionary activities\nsuch as paying dividends to our shareholders,\nshare repurchases and acquisitions. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020 , available parent company\nliquidity totaled $ 13.8 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is primarily held in\nintercompany short-term investments, the terms\nof which provide for the availability of cash\nin 31 days or less. Investments with longer\ndurations may also be acquired, but if so, the\nrelated maturities are aligned with scheduled\ncash needs, such as the maturity of parent\ncompany debt obligations. The principal source\nof parent company liquidity is the dividends\nit receives from PNC Bank, which may be\nimpacted by the following:\n                                \n  \u2022  Bank-level capital needs,  \n                                \n                            \n  \u2022  Laws and regulations,  \n                            \n                          \n  \u2022  Corporate policies,  \n                          \n                                    \n  \u2022  Contractual restrictions, and  \n                                    \n                     \n  \u2022  Other factors.  \n                     \nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was approximately $ 3.1 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 . See Note 18 Regulatory\nMatters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in our 2019 Form 10-K for a further\ndiscussion of these limitations. In addition\nto dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of\nparent company liquidity include cash and\ninvestments, as well as dividends and loan\nrepayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. The parent company has the\nability to offer up to $5.0 billion of\ncommercial paper to provide additional\nliquidity. As of September 30, 2020 , there\nwere no commercial paper issuances\noutstanding. The parent company has an\neffective shelf registration statement\npursuant to which we can issue additional\ndebt, equity and other capital instruments.\nParent company senior and subordinated debt\noutstanding totaled $ 10.7 billion and $9.8\nbillion at September 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 , respectively. Contractual Obligations\nand Commitments We have contractual\nobligations representing required future\npayments on borrowed funds, time deposits,\nleases, pension and postretirement benefits\nand purchase obligations. See the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section in our 2019 Form 10-K for\nmore information on these future cash\noutflows. Additionally, in the normal course\nof business we have various commitments\noutstanding, certain of which are not included\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide\ninformation on our commitments in Note 9\nCommitments in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of this Report. Credit\nRatings PNC\u2019s credit ratings affect the cost\nand availability of short and long-term\nfunding, collateral requirements for certain\nderivative instruments and the ability to\noffer certain products. In general, rating\nagencies base their ratings on many\nquantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding capital adequacy, liquidity, asset\nquality, business mix, level and quality of\nearnings, and the current legislative and\nregulatory environment, including implied\ngovernment support. A decrease, or potential\ndecrease, in credit ratings could impact\naccess to the capital markets and/or increase\nthe cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect\nliquidity and financial condition. 38 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\nTable 29 : Credit Ratings for PNC and PNC Bank\n                                              \n                        September 30,         \n                        2020                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n               Moody\u2019s  Standard\u00a0&     Fitch  \n                        Poor\u2019s                \n  PNC                                         \n  Senior debt  A3       A-             A      \n  Subordinat\u2026  A3       BBB+           A-     \n  debt                                        \n  Preferred    Baa2     BBB-           BBB    \n  stock                                       \n  PNC Bank                                    \n  Senior debt  A2       A              A+     \n  Subordinat\u2026  A3       A-             A      \n  debt                                        \n  Long-term    Aa2      A              AA-    \n  deposits                                    \n  Short-term   P-1      A-1            F1+    \n  deposits                                    \n  Short-term   P-1      A-1            F1     \n  notes                                       \n                                              \nCapital Management Detailed information on our\ncapital management processes and activities,\nincluding additional information on our\nprevious CCAR submissions and capital plans,\nis included in the Capital Management portion\nof the Risk Management section in our 2019\nForm 10-K. We manage our funding and capital\npositions by making adjustments to our balance\nsheet size and composition, issuing or\nredeeming debt, issuing equity or other\ncapital instruments, executing treasury stock\ntransactions and capital redemptions or\nrepurchases, and managing dividend policies\nand retaining earnings. We announced on March\n16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common\nstock repurchase program in conjunction with\nthe Federal Reserve's effort to support the\nU.S. economy during the pandemic, and will\ncontinue the suspension through the fourth\nquarter of 2020, consistent with the extension\nof the Federal Reserve's special capital\ndistribution restrictions. We repurchased $99\nmillion of common shares in the third quarter\nto offset the effects of employee benefit\nplan-related issuances in 2020 as permitted by\nguidance from the Federal Reserve. On October\n1, 2020, the PNC board of directors declared a\nquarterly cash dividend on common stock of\n$1.15 per share payable on November 5, 2020.\nFollowing completion of the 2020 CCAR/DFAST\nprocess, the Federal Reserve announced certain\nlimitations on the capital distributions of\nany CCAR-participating bank holding company\n(including PNC) during the third quarter of\n2020. Under these limitations, PNC and other\nCCAR-participating firms, absent Federal\nReserve approval, were permitted to make only\nthe following capital distributions during the\nthird quarter of 2020:\n                                              \n     Pay common dividends at the same per     \n     share level as paid during the second    \n  \u2022  quarter of 2020, provided that the       \n     amount does not exceed the average of    \n     the firm's net income for the four       \n     preceding calendar quarters;             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Purchase common shares in an amount      \n  \u2022  that equals the amount of share          \n     issuances related to expensed employee   \n     compensation; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Make scheduled payments on additional    \n     Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments.   \n                                              \nOn September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nextended these limitations, with minor\nmodifications, to the fourth quarter of 2020,\nand it reserves the right to extend these\nlimitations to additional quarters,\npotentially in modified form.

The most\nsignificant changes involve the election to\nexclude specific AOCI items from common equity\nTier 1 (CET1) capital and higher thresholds\nused to calculate CET1 capital deductions.\nEffective January 1, 2020, PNC must deduct\nfrom CET1 capital (net of associated deferred\ntax liabilities) investments in unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions, mortgage servicing\nrights and deferred tax assets to the extent\nsuch items individually exceed 25% of the\ninstitution\u2019s adjusted CET1 capital. PNC\u2019s\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2020\nare calculated using the standardized approach\nfor determining risk-weighted assets. Under\nthe standardized approach for determining\ncredit risk-weighted assets, exposures are\ngenerally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.\nExposures to high volatility commercial real\nestate, past due exposures and equity\nexposures are generally subject to higher risk\nweights than other types of exposures. The\nregulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date compared to the CECL ACL at\ntransition. The estimated CECL impact is added\nto CET1 capital through December 31, 2021,\nthen phased-out over the following three\nyears. PNC elected to 40 The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q adopt this\noptional transition provision effective as of\nMarch 31, 2020. See additional discussion of\nthis rule in the Recent Regulatory\nDevelopments section and Item 2 Risk\nManagement of our first quarter 2020 Form\n10-Q. In response to the economic conditions\ncaused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve\nhas adopted a final rule that revises, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of\nsupplementary leverage exposure (the\ndenominator of the supplementary leverage\nratio) by bank holding companies to exclude\nthe on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks. The rule was effective as of April 14,\n2020 and will remain in effect through March\n31, 2021. See additional discussion of this\nrule in the Recent Regulatory Developments\nsection of our first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nAt September 30, 2020 , PNC and PNC Bank, our\nsole bank subsidiary, were both considered\n\u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on applicable U.S.\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. To\nqualify as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, PNC must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6% for\nTier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for\nCommon equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8%\nfor Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at\nleast 5%. Federal banking regulators have\nstated that they expect the largest U.S. bank\nholding companies (BHCs), including PNC, to\nhave a level of regulatory capital well in\nexcess of the regulatory minimum and have\nrequired the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC,\nto have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our September 30,\n2020 capital levels were aligned with them.\nSee the Recent Regulatory Developments section\nof our second quarter 2020 Form 10-Q for\nrecent developments that could have a\npotential impact on our Basel III capital\nratios. We provide additional information\nregarding regulatory capital requirements and\nsome of their potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18\nRegulatory Matters in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nMarket Risk Management See the Market Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nSection in our 2019 Form 10-K for additional\ndiscussion regarding market risk. Market Risk\nManagement \u2013 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate\nrisk results primarily from our traditional\nbanking activities of gathering deposits and\nextending loans. Many factors, including\neconomic and financial conditions, movements\nin interest rates and consumer preferences,\naffect the difference between the interest\nthat we earn on assets and the interest that\nwe pay on liabilities and the level of our\nnoninterest-bearing funding sources.

These assumptions determine the\nfuture level of simulated net interest income\nin the base interest rate scenario and the\nother interest rate scenarios presented in\nTables 31 and 32 . These simulations assume\nthat as assets and liabilities mature, they\nare replaced or repriced at then current\nmarket rates. The following graph presents the\nLIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate\nscenario and each of the alternate scenarios\none year forward. Table 33 : Alternate\nInterest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward The\nthird quarter 2020 interest sensitivity\nanalyses indicate that our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an\nincrease in interest rates and an upward\nsloping interest rate yield curve. We believe\nthat we have the deposit funding base and\nbalance sheet flexibility to adjust, where\nappropriate and permissible, to changing\ninterest rates and market conditions. The\nplanned discontinuance of the requirement that\nbanks submit rates for the calculation of\nLIBOR after 2021 presents risks to the\nfinancial instruments originated, held, or\nserviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference\nrate. PNC holds instruments and services its\ninstruments and instruments owned by others\nthat may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC to financial,\nlegal, operational, and reputational risks.\nPNC has established a cross functional\ngovernance structure to oversee the overall\nstrategy for the transition from LIBOR and\nmitigate risks associated with the transition.\nA LIBOR impact and risk assessment identified\nthe associated risks across products, systems,\nmodels and processes. PNC is actively\nmonitoring its overall firm-wide exposure to\nLIBOR and using these results to plan\ntransitional strategies and track progress\nversus these goals.

See the Risk Factors section in\nItem IA and Risk Management Market Rate\nManagement - Interest Rate Risk section in\nItem 7 disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding the planned\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR as a reference rate.\nMarket Risk Management \u2013 Customer-Related\nTrading Risk We engage in fixed income\nsecurities, derivatives and foreign exchange\ntransactions to support our customers\u2019\ninvesting and hedging activities. These\ntransactions, related hedges and the credit\nvaluation adjustment related to our customer\nderivatives portfolio are marked-to-market\ndaily and reported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products. We use value-at-\nrisk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical correlations across different asset\nclasses. We calculate a diversified VaR at a\n95% confidence interval and the results for\nthe first nine months of 2020 and 2019 were\nwithin our acceptable limits. See the Market\nRisk Management \u2013 Customer-Related Trading\nRisk section of our 2019 Form 10-K for more\ninformation on our models used to calculate\nVaR and our backtesting process. Customer\nrelated trading revenue was $ 293 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2020\ncompared to $212 million for the same period\nin 2019 . The increase was primarily due to\nhigher derivative client sales revenues and\nthe impact of changes in credit valuations for\ncustomer-related derivative activities. For\nthe quarterly period, customer related trading\nrevenue was $108 million for the third quarter\nof 2020 compared to $77 million in 2019. The\nincrease was primarily due to the impact of\nthe changes in credit valuations for customer-\nrelated derivative activities. Market Risk\nManagement \u2013 Equity And Other Investment Risk\nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets. In\naddition to extending credit, taking deposits,\nunderwriting securities and trading financial\ninstruments, we make and manage direct\ninvestments in a variety of transactions,\nincluding management buyouts,\nrecapitalizations and growth financings in a\nvariety of industries. We also have\ninvestments in affiliated and non-affiliated\nfunds that make similar investments in private\nequity. The economic and/or book value of\nthese investments and other assets are\ndirectly affected by changes in market\nfactors. Various PNC business units manage our\nequity and other investment activities. Our\nbusinesses are responsible for making\ninvestment decisions within the approved\npolicy limits and associated guidelines.

These tax credit investment balances\nincluded unfunded commitments totaling $.8\nbillion and $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 , respectively. These\nunfunded commitments are included in Other\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2019\nForm 10-K has further information on Tax\nCredit Investments. Private Equity and Other\nThe majority of our other equity investments\nconsists of our private equity portfolio. The\nprivate equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.4\nbillion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 , respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020 , $1.2 billion was invested\ndirectly in a variety of companies and $ .2\nbillion was invested indirectly through\nvarious private equity funds. See the Recent\nRegulatory Developments section of our second\nquarter 2020 Form 10- The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 43 Q and the\nSupervision and Regulation section in Item 1\nof our 2019 Form 10-K for discussion of the\npotential impacts of the Volcker Rule\nprovisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in\nand other relationships with private funds\ncovered by the Volcker Rule. Included in our\nother equity investments are Visa Class B\ncommon shares, which are recorded at cost.\nVisa Class B common shares that we own are\ntransferable only under limited circumstances\nuntil they can be converted into shares of the\npublicly-traded Class A common shares, which\ncannot happen until the resolution of the\npending interchange litigation. Based upon the\nSeptember 30, 2020 per share closing price of\n$199.97 for a Visa Class A common share, the\nestimated value of our total investment in the\nClass B common shares was approximately $ 1.1\nbillion at the current conversion rate of Visa\nB shares to Visa A shares, while our cost\nbasis was not significant. See Note 6 Fair\nValue and Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of our 2019 10-K for additional\ninformation regarding our Visa agreements. The\nestimated value does not represent fair value\nof the Visa B common shares given the share\u2019s\nlimited transferability and the lack of\nobservable transactions in the marketplace. We\nalso have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were not significant at September\n30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 . Financial\nDerivatives We use a variety of financial\nderivatives as part of the overall asset and\nliability risk management process to help\nmanage exposure to market (primarily interest\nrate) and credit risk inherent in our business\nactivities. We also enter into derivatives\nwith customers to facilitate their risk\nmanagement activities. Financial derivatives\ninvolve, to varying degrees, market and credit\nrisk. Derivatives represent contracts between\nparties that usually require little or no\ninitial net investment and result in one party\ndelivering cash or another type of asset to\nthe other party based on a notional and an\nunderlying as specified in the contract.\nTherefore, cash requirements and exposure to\ncredit risk are significantly less than the\nnotional amount on these instruments. Further\ninformation on our financial derivatives is\npresented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note\n6 Fair Value and Note 13 Financial Derivatives\nin our Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements in our 2019 Form 10-K and in Note\n12 Fair Value and Note 13 Financial\nDerivatives in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in this Report. Not all\nelements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons. R ECENT R EGULATORY D EVELOPMENTS\nCapital, Capital Planning and Liquidity In\nOctober 2020, the federal banking agencies\nfinalized rules implementing the Net Stable\nFunding Ratio (NSFR). The final rules require\ncovered banking organizations, including PNC\nand PNC Bank, to maintain an amount of\navailable stable funding (ASF) equal to or\ngreater than the banking organization\u2019s\nprojected minimum funding needs, or required\nstable funding (RSF), as calculated under the\nrules over a one-year time horizon. Consistent\nwith the tailoring of the Liquidity Coverage\nRatio requirements, Category III banking\norganizations with less than $75 billion in\naverage weighted short-term wholesale funding,\nlike PNC and PNC Bank, will need to meet a\nreduced NSFR requirement, with RSF adjusted by\na 0.85 scalar. The final rule also requires\ncovered holding companies like PNC to publicly\ndisclose their NSFRs and other qualitative\ncomponents of their liquidity profiles on a\nsemi-annual basis. The final rules take effect\non July 1, 2021. PNC has taken several actions\nto prepare for implementation of the NSFR, and\nwe expect to be in compliance with the NSFR\nrequirements when they become effective. On\nOctober 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended,\nuntil March 31, 2021, certain temporary\nactions taken to increase the availability of\nintraday credit extended by Federal Reserve\nBanks. These actions include suspending the\nFederal Reserve's uncollateralized intraday\ncredit limits (net debit caps), waiving\noverdraft fees for institutions that are\neligible for the primary credit program, and\nsuspending two collections of information that\nare used to calculate net debit caps. On\nSeptember 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nannounced that it would extend its special\nlimitations on capital distributions by\nbanking organizations that participated in the\n2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR) process, such as PNC, through the\nfourth quarter of 2020. These special\nlimitations require covered banking\norganizations to suspend share repurchases\n(except those to offset the effects of\nemployee benefit plan-related issuances) and\nallows organizations to maintain their common\ndividends subject to a formula based on recent\nincome. Additionally, in September 2020, the\nFederal Reserve released the hypothetical\nsupervisory scenarios to be used in the second\nround of stress tests to be conducted in the\nfourth quarter of 2020 due to the continued\neconomic uncertainty presented by the COVID-19\npandemic. Bank stress test submissions were\ndue on November 2, 2020, and the Federal\nReserve has indicated it will publicly release\nthe results of the tests by the end of the\nyear. 44 The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q In September 2020, the\nFederal Reserve requested comment on a\nproposal that would update the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital planning requirements to be\nconsistent with the capital and liquidity\ntailoring rules adopted last year. In addition\nto changing certain assumptions about material\nbusiness changes under stress, the proposal\ninvites comment on all aspects of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s existing capital planning guidance.\nComments on the proposal are due by November\n20, 2020. In August and September 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies adopted in final form\nseveral regulatory capital rules that were\nissued in interim final form earlier this\nyear. These rules permit banking organizations\nthat are subject to the CECL accounting\nstandard during 2020 to delay CECL\u2019s estimated\nimpact on CET1 capital, revise the definition\nof \u201celigible retained income\u201d for purposes of\nthe Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) and other\nBasel III capital buffers and neutralize the\nregulatory capital and liquidity coverage\nratio effects of participating in the Federal\nReserve\u2019s Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility and Paycheck Protection Program\nLiquidity Facility. For more information, see\nItem 2 Recent Regulatory Developments in our\nsecond quarter 2020 Form 10-Q. Other\nDevelopments In October 2020, the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a\nrule that determines when a national bank like\nPNC Bank makes a loan and is the \"true\nlender,\" including in the context of a\npartnership between a bank and a third party.\nUnder the final rule, a bank is the true\nlender if, as of the date of origination, it\nis named as the lender in the loan agreement\nor funds the loan. On August 13, 2020, an\ninterim rule adopted by the Federal\nAcquisition Regulatory Council to implement\ncertain provisions of the John S. McCain\nNational Defense Authorization Act took\neffect. This rule prohibits the Department of\nDefense and all other executive branch\nagencies from contracting (or extending or\nrenewing a contract) with an entity that uses\ncovered telecommunication equipment or\nservices provided by certain Chinese companies\nas a substantial or essential part of any\nsystem. It is possible that these restrictions\nmay affect PNC\u2019s ability to compete for U.S.\ngovernment contracts, at least in the short-\nterm. In August 2020, the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (Bureau) issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking to create a new category\nof seasoned qualified mortgages (Seasoned\nQMs), which are presumed to meet the ability-\nto-pay requirements established by the Dodd-\nFrank Act. To be considered a Seasoned QM\nunder the proposal, loans would have to be\nfirst-lien, fixed-rate mortgages that have met\ncertain performance requirements over a\n36-month seasoning period. Covered\ntransactions would also have to be held on the\ncreditor\u2019s portfolio during the seasoning\nperiod, comply with general restrictions on\nproduct features and points and fees and meet\ncertain underwriting requirements (including\nverification of the consumer\u2019s debt-to-income\nratio (DTI) or residual income at\norigination). The comment period for the\nproposal ended on October 1, 2020. C RITICAL A\nCCOUNTING E STIMATES AND J UDGMENTS Note 1\nAccounting Policies of our 2019 Form 10-K\ndescribes the most significant accounting\npolicies that we use to prepare our\nconsolidated financial statements, including\ndiscussion of our policies for the Allowances\nfor Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan\nCommitments and Letters of Credit, prior to\nthe adoption of the CECL standard. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this\nReport regarding the impact of new accounting\npronouncements, including CECL, that were\nadopted during 2020. Certain policies require\nus to make estimates or economic assumptions\nthat may vary under different assumptions or\nconditions, and such variations may\nsignificantly affect our reported results and\nfinancial position for the period or in future\nperiods. The following critical accounting\npolicies and judgments are described in more\ndetail in Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments in Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K:\n                              \n  \u2022  Fair Value Measurements  \n                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Residential and Commercial Mortgage      \n     Servicing Rights                         \n                                              \nAllowance for Credit Losses We maintain the\nACL at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our existing\ninvestment securities, loans, finance leases\n(including residual values), other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets taking into consideration\nexpected prepayments. Our determination of the\nACL is based on historical loss experience,\nborrower characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We use methods sensitive to\nchanges in economic conditions, to interpret\nthese factors to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate ACL on an\nongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to\nreflect in the ACL our best estimate of\namounts that we do not expect to collect\nbecause of, among other things, idiosyncratic\nrisk factors, changes in economic conditions\nthat may not be reflected in forecasted\nresults, or other potential methodology\nweaknesses. The ACL estimates are therefore\nsusceptible to various factors, including, but\nnot limited to, the following major factors:\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 45 \u2022 Current economic conditions and\nborrower quality: Our forecast of expected\nlosses depends on conditions and portfolio\nquality as of the estimation date. As current\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n                                              \n     Scenario weights and design: Our loss    \n  \u2022  estimates are sensitive to the shape     \n     and severity of macroeconomic forecasts  \n     and thus                                 \n                                              \nvary significantly between upside and downside\nscenarios. Change to probability weights\nassigned to these scenarios and timing of peak\nbusiness cycles reflected by the scenarios\ncould materially affect our loss estimates.\n                                              \n     Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to     \n  \u2022  portfolio volume and mix could           \n     materially affect our estimates, as      \n     CECL reserves                            \n                                              \nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition. For all assets and unfunded\nlending related commitments within the scope\nof the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is\ncomposed of one or a combination of the\nfollowing components: (i) collectively\nassessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually\nassessed reserves, and (iii) qualitative\n(judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and\nkey assumptions for each of these components\nare discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nof this Report. Reasonable and Supportable\nEconomic Forecast Under CECL, we are required\nto consider reasonable and supportable\nforecasts in estimating expected credit\nlosses. For this purpose, we have established\na framework which includes a three year\nreasonable and supportable economic forecast\nperiod and the use of four economic scenarios\nwith associated probability weights, which in\ncombination create a forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes over our reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period (RSFP). Our RSFP\ncredit loss estimates are sensitive to the\nshape and severity of the scenarios used and\nweights assigned to them. To generate the four\neconomic forecast scenarios we use a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic\nmodels, other measures of economic activity\nand forward-looking expert judgment to\nforecast the distribution of economic outcomes\nover the RSFP. Each scenario is then given an\nassociated probability (weight) in order to\nrepresent our current expectation within that\ndistribution over the RSFP. This process is\ninformed by current economic conditions,\nexpected business cycle evolution and the\nexpert judgment of PNC\u2019s CECL Reserve Adequacy\nCommittee (CECL RAC). This approach seeks to\nprovide a reasonable representation of the\nforecast of expected economic outcomes and is\nused to estimate expected credit losses across\na variety of loans and securities. Each\nquarter the scenarios are presented for\napproval to PNC\u2019s CECL RAC and the committee\ndetermines and approves CECL scenarios weights\nfor use for the current reporting period. The\ns cenarios used for the period ended September\n30, 2020 were designed to reflect the improved\nmacroeconomic outlook and the recovery that\nbegan in May which has outpaced market\nexpectations, and was our best estimate as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. We used a number of\neconomic variables in our scenarios, with the\nmost significant drivers being GDP and the\nunemployment rate measures. Using the\nweighted-average of our four economic forecast\nscenarios, we estimated at September 30, 2020\nthat GDP finishes the year down 4.2% from\nfourth quarter 2019 levels and grows 3.8% in\n2021, recovering to pre-recession peak levels\nby the first quarter of 2022. One of the\nscenarios included in our weighted-average is\nour baseline prediction of the most likely\neconomic outcome, which is further discussed\nin our Business Outlook and the Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation in this Financial Review, and\nincludes estimated GDP recovering to pre-\npandemic levels by late 2021. The weighted-\naverage unemployment rate was estimated to be\n8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the\nlabor market continuing to recover in 2021 and\n2022. While the economy has seen significant\nrecovery with national level macroeconomic\nindicators outperforming market expectations,\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding overall\nlifetime loss content for both our commercial\nand consumer portfolios remains, specifically\nas it relates to our customers that are less\nlikely to benefit from the economic recovery\ncurrently underway. For commercial borrowers,\nthere are substantial concerns around\nindustries that are dependent on in-person\ngatherings, hospitality and tourism. For\nconsumer borrowers, payment behavior once the\nCARES Act stimulus wanes is also difficult to\npredict but we believe the highest uncertainty\nis concentrated within consumer borrowers who\nhave been afforded accommodation as it relates\nto payment deferral/forbearance. As such, PNC\nidentified and performed significant analysis\naround these key, high risk segments to ensure\nour reserves were adequate in light of the\nimproved economic environment. We believe that\nthe economic assumptions used in the scenarios\nfor the third quarter of 2020, in combination\nwith increased reserves for borrowers in\nsegments most adversely impacted by the\npandemic, sufficiently reflect the life of\nloan losses in the current portfolio. For\ninternal analytical purposes, we considered\nwhat our capital ratios would be if we had an\nACL at December 31, 2020 equal to the Federal\nReserve's estimated nine quarter credit losses\nfor PNC under the 2020 CCAR supervisory\nseverely adverse scenario of $12.1 billion,\nincreasing the reserves by approximately $5.6\nbillion over the next quarter. This analysis\nresulted in a CET1 ratio of approximately\n10.5% at December 31, 2020, a level well above\n7.0%, which is our regulatory minimum of 4.5%\nplus our Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5%. This\nscenario was not our expectation at September\n30, 2020 and does not reflect our current\nexpectation, nor does it capture all the\npotential unknown variables that would likely\narise through the remainder of 2020, but it\nprovides an approximation of a possible\noutcome under hypothetical severe conditions.\nThe CECL methodology inherently requires a\nhigh degree of judgment. As a result, it is\npossible that we may, at another point in\ntime, reach different conclusions regarding\nour credit loss estimates. 46 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q See\nthe following for additional details on the\ncomponents of our ACL, as well as the\nmethodologies and related assumptions:\n                                              \n     Allowance For Credit Losses in the       \n  \u2022  Credit Risk Management section of this   \n     Financial Review, and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Note1Accounting Policies,                \n     Note3Investment Securitiesand            \n  \u2022  Note4Loans and Related Allowance for     \n     Credit Lossesin the Notes To             \n     Consolidated Financial Statements        \n     included in this Report.                 \n                                              \nO FF -B ALANCE S HEET A RRANGEMENTS A ND V\nARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES We engage in a\nvariety of activities that involve entities\nthat are not consolidated or otherwise\nreflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet\nthat are generally referred to as off-balance\nsheet arrangements.

These statements are      \n     based on our view that:                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     The U.S. economy is in a nascent         \n     economic recovery in the second half of  \n     2020, following a very severe but very   \n     short economic contraction in the first  \n     half of the year due to the COVID-19     \n     pandemic and public health measures to   \n     contain it. Real GDP declined            \n     significantly in the first and second    \n     quarters of 2020, as many firms closed,  \n  \u2013  at least temporarily, and consumers      \n     stayed at home. Since the late           \n     spring/early summer, economic activity   \n     has picked up due to loosening           \n     restrictions on businesses, massive      \n     federal stimulus, and extremely low      \n     interest rates. Between May and          \n     September the economy added back         \n     slightly more than half of the 22        \n     million jobs lost in March and April.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Despite the improvement in the economy   \n     in recent months, economic activity      \n     remains far below its pre-pandemic       \n     level and unemployment remains           \n     elevated. Real GDP growth in the third   \n     quarter was extremely strong, at an      \n     annual rate of 33.1%, but will slow in   \n     the fourth quarter and through 2021.     \n  \u2013  PNC does not expect real GDP to return   \n     to its pre-pandemic level until late     \n     2021, and does not expect employment to  \n     return to its pre-pandemic level until   \n     2023. Risks to this outlook are          \n     weighted to the downside; they include   \n     a further resurgence in the spread of    \n     the coronavirus and a lack of            \n     additional stimulus from the federal     \n     government.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Monetary policy remains extremely        \n     supportive of economic growth.  PNC      \n  \u2013  expects the Federal Open Market          \n     Committee to keep the federal funds      \n     rate in its current range of 0.00% to    \n     0.25% through at least mid-2024.         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Given the many unknowns and risks being  \n     heavily weighted to the downside, our    \n     forward-looking statements are subject   \n     to the risk that conditions will be      \n     substantially different than we are      \n     currently expecting. If efforts to       \n     contain COVID-19 are unsuccessful and    \n     restrictions on businesses and           \n     activities are not further lifted or     \n     are reimposed, the recovery would be     \n     much weaker. There is even the           \n     potential that the economy could fall    \n     back into recession. PNC's baseline      \n     scenario assumes additional fiscal       \n     stimulus; continued inaction on          \n     stimulus is another major downside       \n     risk. The longer it takes to combat the  \n  \u2022  pandemic, the more permanent damage it   \n     will cause to business and consumer      \n     fundamentals and sentiment; this could   \n     make the recovery weaker and result in   \n     permanently lower long-run economic      \n     growth. An extended global recession     \n     due to COVID-19 would weaken the U.S.    \n     recovery. As a result, the outbreak and  \n     its consequences, including responsive   \n     measures to manage it, have had and are  \n     likely to continue to have an adverse    \n     effect, possibly materially, on our      \n     business and financial performance by    \n     adversely affecting the demand and       \n     profitability of our products and        \n     services, the valuation of assets and    \n     our ability to meet the needs of our     \n     customers.                               \n                                              \n48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n     PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital    \n     actions, including returning capital to  \n     shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting  \n     or exceeding a stress capital buffer     \n     established by the Federal Reserve       \n     Board in connection with the Federal     \n  \u2022  Reserve Board's CCAR process.

Unaudited B\nUSINESS The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n(PNC) is one of the largest diversified\nfinancial services companies in the United\nStates (U.S.) and is headquartered in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We have businesses\nengaged in retail banking, including\nresidential mortgage, corporate and\ninstitutional banking and asset management,\nproviding many of our products and services\nnationally. Our retail branch network is\nlocated primarily in markets across the Mid-\nAtlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have\nstrategic international offices in four\ncountries outside the U.S. N OTE 1 A CCOUNTING\nP OLICIES Basis of Financial Statement\nPresentation Our consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of the parent\ncompany and its subsidiaries, most of which\nare wholly-owned, certain partnership\ninterests and variable interest entities. We\nprepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (GAAP). We have eliminated\nintercompany accounts and transactions. In our\nopinion, the unaudited interim consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all normal,\nrecurring adjustments needed to present fairly\nour results for the interim periods. The\nresults of operations for interim periods are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that\nmay be expected for the full year or any other\ninterim period. We have also considered the\nimpact of subsequent events on these\nconsolidated financial statements. When\npreparing these unaudited interim consolidated\nfinancial statements, we have assumed that you\nhave read the audited consolidated financial\nstatements included in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nThese interim consolidated financial\nstatements serve to update our 2019 Form 10-K\nand may not include all information and Notes\nnecessary to constitute a complete set of\nfinancial statements. There have been\nsignificant changes to our accounting policies\nas disclosed in our 2019 Form 10-K due to the\nadoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses\n(CECL) standard and our discontinued operation\nas a result of the disposal of our equity\ninvestment in BlackRock. As a result of this\ndisposal, BlackRock\u2019s historical results of\noperations are reported as discontinued\noperations in our consolidated financial\nstatements for all periods presented. The\nupdated policies impacted by these changes are\nincluded in this Note 1. Reference is made to\nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2019 Form\n10-K for a detailed description of all other\nsignificant accounting policies. Use of\nEstimates We prepared these consolidated\nfinancial statements using financial\ninformation available at the time of\npreparation, which requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported. Our most significant\nestimates pertain to our fair value\nmeasurements and allowance for credit losses\n(ACL). Actual results may differ from the\nestimates and the differences may be material\nto the consolidated financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations A disposal of an asset\nor business that meets the criteria for held\nfor sale classification is reported as\ndiscontinued operations when the disposal\nrepresents a strategic shift that has had, or\nwill have, a major effect on our operating\nresults. We report an asset as held for sale\nwhen management has approved or received\napproval to sell the asset and is committed to\na formal plan, the asset is available for\nimmediate sale, the asset is being actively\nmarketed, the sale is anticipated to occur\nduring the ensuing year and certain other\nspecified criteria are met. An asset\nclassified as held for sale is recorded at the\nlower of its carrying amount or estimated fair\nvalue less cost to sell. If the carrying\namount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair\nvalue, the asset is written down to its fair\nvalue upon the held for sale designation. Our\nBlackRock held for sale asset is recorded at\nits carrying amount as we accounted for this\ninvestment under the equity method of\naccounting and the fair value of the asset\nexceeded the carrying value at each balance\nsheet date. When presenting discontinued\noperations, assets classified as held for sale\nare segregated in the Consolidated Balance\nSheet commencing in the period in which the\nasset meets all of the held for sale criteria\ndescribed above and prior periods are recast.\nThe results of discontinued operations are\nreported in Discontinued Operations in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income for current\nand The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q 55 prior periods commencing in the\nperiod in which the asset or business is\neither disposed of or is classified as held\nfor sale, including any gain or loss\nrecognized on the sale or adjustment of the\ncarrying amount to fair value less cost to\nsell. Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings\nper common share is calculated using the two-\nclass method to determine income attributable\nto common shareholders. Unvested share-based\npayment awards that contain nonforfeitable\nrights to dividends or dividend equivalents\nare considered participating securities under\nthe two-class method. Distributed dividends\nand dividend equivalents related to\nparticipating securities and an allocation of\nundistributed net income to participating\nsecurities reduce the amount of income\nattributable to common shareholders. In a\nperiod with a loss, no allocation will be made\nto the participating securities, as they do\nnot have a contractual obligation to absorb\nlosses. Income attributable to common\nshareholders is then divided by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted earnings per common share is\ncalculated under the more dilutive of either\nthe treasury method or the two-class method.\nFor the diluted calculation, we increase the\nweighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding by the assumed conversion of\noutstanding convertible preferred stock from\nthe beginning of the year or date of issuance,\nif later, and the number of shares of common\nstock that would be issued assuming the\nexercise of stock options and warrants and the\nissuance of incentive shares using the\ntreasury stock method. These adjustments to\nthe weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding are made only when\nsuch adjustments will dilute earnings per\ncommon share. For periods in which there is a\nloss from continuing operations, any potential\ndilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this\nscenario, no potential dilutive shares will be\nincluded in the continuing operations,\ndiscontinued operations or total earnings per\ncommon share calculations, even if overall net\nincome is reported.See Note 11 Earnings Per\nShare for additional information. 56 The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                   Financial      \n  Standards     Description    Statement      \n  Update (ASU)                 Impact         \n                \u2022 Commonly                    \n                referred to                   \n                as the CECL                   \n                standard.                     \n                \u2022 Replaces     \u2022 Adopted      \n                measurement,   January 1,     \n                recognition    2020 under     \n                and            the modified   \n                disclosure     retrospective  \n                guidance for   approach.

We classify\ndebt securities as either trading, held to\nmaturity, or available for sale. Debt\nsecurities that we purchase for certain risk\nmanagement activities or customer-related\ntrading activities are classified as trading\nsecurities, are reported in the Other assets\nline item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet,\nand are carried at fair value. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses on trading\nsecurities are included in Other noninterest\nincome. We classify debt securities as held to\nmaturity when we have the positive intent and\nability to hold the securities to maturity,\nand carry them at amortized cost, less any\nallowance. Debt securities not classified as\nheld to maturity or trading are classified as\nsecurities available for sale, and are carried\nat fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale securities are included in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\nnet of income taxes. We include all interest\non debt securities, including amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts on\ninvestment securities, in net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method\ngenerally calculated over the contractual\nlives of the securities. Effective yields\nreflect either the effective interest rate\nimplicit in the security at the date of\nacquisition or, for debt securities where an\nother-than-temporary impairment was recorded,\nthe effective interest rate determined based\non improved cash flows subsequent to an\nimpairment. We compute gains and losses\nrealized on the sale of available for sale\ndebt securities on a specific security basis.\nThese securities gains/(losses) are included\nin Other noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement. As discussed in\nthe Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nsection of this Note 1 , we adopted the CECL\nstandard as of January 1, 2020, which requires\nexpected credit losses on both held to\nmaturity and available for sale securities to\nbe recognized through a valuation allowance,\nACL, instead of as a direct write-down to the\namortized cost basis of the security. An\navailable for sale security is considered\nimpaired if the fair value is less than\namortized cost basis. If any portion of the\ndecline in fair value is related to credit,\nthe amount of allowance is determined as the\nportion related to credit, limited to the\ndifference between the amortized cost basis\nand the fair value of the security. If we have\nthe intent to sell or believe it is more\nlikely than not we will be required to sell an\nimpaired available for sale security before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis, the\ncredit loss is recorded as a direct write-down\nof the amortized cost basis. Credit losses on\ninvestment securities are recognized through\nthe Provision for credit losses on our\nConsolidated Income Statement. Declines in the\nfair value of available for sale securities\nthat are not considered credit related are\nrecognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The CECL standard is applied\nprospectively to debt securities and, as a\nresult, the amortized cost basis of investment\nsecurities for which OTTI had previously been\nrecorded did not change upon adoption. For\ninformation on the policies previously applied\nto determine OTTI, see the Debt Securities\nsection of Note 1 Accounting Policies in our\n2019 Form 10-K. We consider a security to be\npast due in terms of payment based on its\ncontractual terms. A security may be placed on\nnonaccrual, with interest no longer recognized\nuntil received, when collectability of\nprincipal or interest is doubtful. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020 , nonaccrual or past due\nheld-to-maturity securities were immaterial. A\nsecurity may be partially or fully charged off\nagainst the allowance if it is determined to\nbe uncollectible, including, for an available\nfor sale security, if we have the intent to\nsell or believe it is more likely than not we\nwill be required to sell the security before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nRecoveries of previously charged-off available\nfor sale securities are recognized when\nreceived, while recoveries on held to maturity\nsecurities are recognized when expected. See\nthe Allowance for Credit Loss section of this\nNote 1 for further discussion regarding the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities. See Note 3\nInvestment Securities for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio and the related ACL. Loans Loans are\nclassified as held for investment when\nmanagement has both the intent and ability to\nhold the loan for the foreseeable future, or\nuntil maturity or payoff. Management\u2019s intent\nand view of the foreseeable future may change\nbased on changes in business strategies, the\neconomic environment, market conditions and\nthe availability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. See Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information on how COVID-19\nhardship related loan modifications are\nreported from a delinquency perspective as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. Loans held for investment,\nexcluding PCD loans, are recorded at amortized\ncost basis unless we elect to measure these\nunder the fair value option. Amortized cost\nbasis represents principal amounts\noutstanding, net of unearned income,\nunamortized deferred fees, costs on originated\nloans, and premiums or discounts on purchased\nloans, and charge-offs. Amortized cost basis\ndoes not include accrued interest, as we\ninclude accrued interest in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest on\nperforming loans is accrued based on the\nprincipal amount outstanding and recorded in\nInterest income as earned using the constant\neffective yield method. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net The PNC\nFinancial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q 59\ninterest income using the constant effective  \nyield method, over the contractual life of the\nloan. The processing fee received for loans   \noriginated under the Paycheck Protection      \nProgram (PPP) is deferred and accreted into   \nNet interest income using the effective yield \nmethod, over the contractual life of the loan.\nLoans under the fair value option are reported\nat their fair value, with any changes to fair \nvalue reported as Noninterest income on the   \nConsolidated Income Statement, and are        \nexcluded from measurement of ALLL.            \n                                              \nIn addition to originating loans, we also     \nacquire loans through the secondary loan      \nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother                                         \n                                              \nfinancial services companies. Certain acquired\nloans that have experienced a more than       \nsignificant deterioration of credit quality   \nsince origination (i.e., PCD) are recognized  \nat an amortized cost basis equal to their     \npurchase price plus an ALLL measured at the   \nacquisition date. Subsequent decreases in     \nexpected cash flows that are attributable, at \nleast in part, to credit quality are          \nrecognized through a charge to the provision  \nfor credit losses resulting in an increase in \nthe ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected    \ncash flows are recognized as a provision      \nrecapture of previously recorded ALLL.        \n                                              \nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent \nwhen we determine that substantially all of   \nthe expected cash flows will be generated     \n                                              \nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral  \nunderlying the loan, the borrower is          \nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have \nelected to                                    \n                                              \nmeasure the loan at the estimated fair value  \nof collateral (less costs to sell if sale or  \nforeclosure of the property is expected).     \n                                              \nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be        \ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or      \nliquidation of the underlying collateral is   \nprobable.                                     \n                                              \nA troubled debt restructuring (TDR) is a loan \nwhose terms have been restructured in a manner\nthat grants a concession to a borrower        \nexperiencing financial difficulty. A          \nconcession has been granted when we do not    \nexpect to collect all amounts due, including  \noriginal interest accrued at the original     \ncontract rate, as a result of the             \nrestructuring, or there is a delay in payment \nthat is more than insignificant. TDRs result  \nfrom our loss mitigation activities, and      \ninclude rate reductions, principal            \nforgiveness, postponement/reduction of        \nscheduled amortization, and extensions, which \nare intended to minimize economic loss and to \navoid foreclosure or repossession of          \ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result    \nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from \npersonal liability through Chapter 7          \nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed   \ntheir loan obligations to us. In those        \nsituations where principal is forgiven, the   \namount of such principal forgiveness is       \nimmediately charged off.                      \n                                              \nPotential incremental losses or recoveries on \nTDRs have been factored into the ALLL         \nestimates for each loan class under the       \nmethodologies described in this Note. Once a  \nloan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be    \nreported as a TDR until it is ultimately      \nrepaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed  \nupon, or it is fully charged off.             \nPNC excludes consumer loans held for sale,\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption and certain government insured or\nguaranteed loans from our TDR population. PCD\nloans that do not meet the criteria to be\nclassified as TDRs are also excluded. In\naddition, PNC has elected not to apply a TDR\ndesignation to loans that have been\nrestructured due to a COVID-19 hardship\npursuant to specific criteria under the CARES\nAct. Since loans restructured due to a\nCOVID-19 related hardship were not identified\nas TDRs, they are not placed on nonaccrual at\nthe time of modification. However, these loans\nwill be subject to our existing nonaccrual\npolicy subsequent to the modification.\nSee the following for additional information  \nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and \nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL,\nand additional details on the composition of  \nour loan portfolio:                           \n                                              \n  \u2022  Nonperforming Loans and Leases section   \n     of this Note 1,                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Allowance for Credit Losses section of   \n     this Note1, and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Note4Loans and Related Allowance for     \n     Credit Losses.                           \n                                              \nLoans Held for Sale                           \n                                              \nWe designate loans as held for sale when we   \nhave the intent to sell them.

Write-downs on   \nthese loans (if required) are recorded as     \ncharge-offs through the valuation allowance.  \nAdjustments to the valuation allowance on held\nfor sale loans are recognized in Other        \nnoninterest income.                           \n                                              \nWe have elected to account for certain        \ncommercial and residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale at fair value.

Certain small business credit\ncard balances that are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus when they become 90 days or more past\ndue are charged-off at 180 days past due.\nConsumer We generally charge off secured\nconsumer (home equity, residential real estate\nand automobile) nonperforming loans to the\nfair value of collateral less costs to sell,\nif lower than the amortized cost basis of the\nloan outstanding, when delinquency of the\nloan, combined with other risk factors (e.g.,\nbankruptcy, lien position, or troubled debt\nrestructuring), indicates that the loan, or\nsome portion thereof, is uncollectible as per\nour historical experience, or the collateral\nhas been repossessed. We charge-off secured\nconsumer loans no later than 180 days past\ndue. Most consumer loans and lines of credit,\nnot secured by automobiles or residential real\nestate, are charged off once they have reached\n120-180 days past due. For secured collateral\ndependent loans, collateral values are updated\nat least annually and subsequent declines in\ncollateral values are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected.\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans For nonaccrual\nloans, interest income accrual and deferred\nfee/cost recognition is discontinued.\nAdditionally, the current year accrued and\nuncollected interest is reversed through Net\ninterest income and prior year accrued and\nuncollected interest is charged-off, except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged-off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell. If payment is\nreceived on a nonaccrual loan, generally the\npayment is first applied to the remaining\nprincipal balance; payments are then applied\nto recover any charged-off amounts related to\nthe loan. Finally, if both principal balance\nand any charge-offs have been recovered, then\nthe payment will be recorded as fee and\ninterest income. For certain consumer loans,\nthe receipt of interest payments is recognized\nas interest income on a cash basis. Cash basis\nincome recognition is applied if a loan\u2019s\namortized cost basis is deemed fully\ncollectible and the loan has performed for at\nleast six months. For TDRs, payments are\napplied based upon their contractual terms\nunless the related loan is deemed non-\nperforming. TDRs are generally included in\nnonperforming and nonaccrual loans. However,\nafter a reasonable period of time, generally\nsix months, in which the loan performs under\nrestructured terms and meets other performance\nindicators, it is returned to\nperforming/accruing status. This return to\nperforming/accruing status demonstrates that\nthe bank expects to collect all of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nTDRs resulting from (i) borrowers that have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus, and (ii) borrowers that are not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Other nonaccrual\nloans are generally not returned to accrual\nstatus until the borrower has performed in\naccordance with the contractual terms and\nother performance indicators for at least six\nmonths, the period of time which was\ndetermined to demonstrate the expected\ncollection of the loan\u2019s remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest. Nonaccrual loans with\npartially charged-off principal are not\nreturned to accrual. When a nonperforming loan\nis returned to accrual status, it is then\nconsidered a performing loan. Foreclosed\nassets consist of any asset seized or property\nacquired through a foreclosure proceeding or\nacceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nOther real estate owned (OREO) comprises\nprincipally commercial and residential real\nestate properties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense. For certain\nmortgage loans that have a government\nguarantee, we establish a separate other\nreceivable upon foreclosure. The receivable is\nmeasured based on the loan balance (inclusive\nof principal and interest) that is expected to\nbe recovered from the guarantor.

We\nmaintain the ACL at an appropriate level for\nexpected losses on our existing investment\nsecurities, loans, finance leases (including\nresidual values), other financial assets and\nunfunded lending related commitments, for the\nestimated contractual term of the assets or\nexposures as of the balance sheet date. We\nestimate the estimated contractual term of\nassets in scope of CECL considering\ncontractual maturity dates, prepayment\nexpectations, utilization or draw expectations\nand any embedded extension options that do not\nallow us to unilaterally cancel the extension\noptions. For products without a fixed\ncontractual maturity date ( e.g ., credit\ncards), we rely on historical payment behavior\nto determine the length of the pay down or\ndefault time period. We estimate expected\nlosses on a pooled basis using a combination\nof (i) the expected losses over a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period (RSFP), (ii) a\nperiod of reversion to long run average (LRA)\nexpected losses (reversion period) where\napplicable, and (iii) the LRA expected losses\nfor the remaining estimated contractual term.\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable. We use\nforward-looking information in estimating\nexpected credit losses for the RSFP. For this\npurpose, we use the forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC's Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative techniques, analysis from PNC\neconomists and management judgment. The\nreversion period is used to bridge RSFP and\nLRA expected credit losses. We may consider a\nnumber of factors in determining the duration\nof the reversion period, such as contractual\nmaturity of the asset, observed historical\npatterns and the estimated credit loss rates\nat the end of RSFP relative to the beginning\nof the LRA period. The LRA expected credit\nlosses are derived from long run historical\ncredit loss information adjusted for the\ncredit quality of the current portfolio, and\ntherefore do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions. See the\nfollowing sections related to investment\nsecurities, loans, trade receivables, other\nfinancial assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments for details about specific\nmethodologies. Allowance for Investment\nSecurities A significant portion of our\ninvestment securities are issued or guaranteed\nby either the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury\nor Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA)) or a government-sponsored agency\n(Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)\nor Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(FHLMC)). Taking into consideration historical\ninformation and current and forecasted\nconditions, we do not expect to incur any\ncredit losses on these securities. Investment\nsecurities that are not issued or guaranteed\nby the U.S. government or a government-\nsponsored agency consist of both securitized\nproducts, such as non-agency mortgage and\nasset-backed securities, as well as non-\nsecuritized products, such as corporate and\nmunicipal debt securities. A discounted cash\nflow approach is primarily used to determine\nthe amount of the allowance required. The\nestimates of expected cash flows are\ndetermined using macroeconomic sensitive\nmodels taking into consideration the RSFP and\nscenarios discussed above. Additional factors\nunique to a specific security may also be\ntaken into consideration when estimating\nexpected cash flows. The cash flows expected\nto be collected, after considering expected\nprepayments, are discounted at the effective\ninterest rate. For an available-for-sale\nsecurity, the amount of the allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nestimated fair value. See Note 3 Investment\nSecurities in this Report for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as probability of default (PD), loss\ngiven default (LGD) and exposure at default\n(EAD) for a loan or loan segment. We also\nconsider the impact of prepayments and\namortization on contractual maturity in our\nexpected loss estimates. We use historical\ncredit loss information, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics and forecasted economic\nvariables for the RSFP, coupled with\nanalytical methods, to estimate these risk\nparameters by loan or loan segments. PD, LGD\nand EAD parameters are calculated for each\nforecasted scenario and the LRA period, and\ncombined to generate expected loss estimates\nby scenario. The following matrix provides key\ncredit risk characteristics that we use to\nestimate these risk parameters.

Other than the estimation of the   \nprobability of funding, this reserve is       \nestimated in a manner similar to the          \nmethodology used for determining reserves for \nloans and leases. The allowance for unfunded  \nlending related commitments is recorded as a  \nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  \nNet adjustments to this reserve are included  \nin the provision for credit losses.           \n                                              \nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for    \nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.                               \n                                              \nAllowance for Other Financial Assets          \n                                              \nWe determine the allowance for other financial\nassets (e.g., trade receivables, servicing    \nadvances on PNC-owned loans, balances with    \nbanks) considering historical loss information\nand other available indicators. In certain    \ncases where there are no historical, current  \nor forecast indicators of an expected credit  \nloss, we may estimate the reserve to be close \nto zero. As of September 30, 2020 , the       \nallowance for other financial assets was      \nimmaterial.                                   \nGoodwill                                      \nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions   \nrepresents the value attributable to          \nunidentifiable intangible elements in the     \nbusiness acquired. At least annually, in the  \nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events  \noccur or circumstances have changed           \nsignificantly from the annual test date,      \nmanagement performs our goodwill impairment   \ntest at a reporting unit level.               \nPNC has the ability to first perform a        \nqualitative analysis to evaluate whether it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a \nreporting unit is less than its carrying      \namount. If, after considering all relevant    \nevents and circumstances, PNC determines it is\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value  \nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying \namount, then performing a quantitative        \nimpairment test is not necessary. If PNC      \nelects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or \nconcludes via qualitative analysis that it is \nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a \nreporting unit is less than its carrying      \namount, a quantitative goodwill impairment    \ntest is performed. Inputs                     \n66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q are generated and used in\ncalculating the fair value of the reporting\nunit, which is compared to its carrying\namount. The fair value of our reporting units\nis determined by using discounted cash flows\nand/or market comparability methodologies. If\nthe fair value is greater than the carrying\namount, then the reporting unit's goodwill is\ndeemed not to be impaired. If the fair value\nis less than the carrying amount, an entity\nshould recognize an impairment charge for the\namount by which the carrying amount of\ngoodwill exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair\nvalue. The loss recognized should not exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit.

We\nmaintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. As of September 30, 2020 , the\nallowance for investment securities was $\n71million and primarily related to non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities in the\navailable for sale portfolio and other debt\nsecurities in the held to maturity portfolio.\nThe provision for credit losses on investment\nsecurities totaled $ 39million and $ 69million\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2020 . In the first quarter of 2020, upon\nthe adoption of ASU 2019-04, we elected to\ntransfer debt securities with an amortized\ncost of $ 16.2billion and a fair value of $\n16.5billion from the held to maturity to the\navailable for sale portfolio. During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, pursuant to the\nguidance in ASU 2020-04, we elected to\ntransfer debt securities with an amortized\ncost of $ 49million and a fair value of $\n48million from the held to maturity to the\navailable for sale portfolio.

As of September 30, 2020 , 85% of\nour securities held to maturity were rated    \nAAA/AA.                                       \nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Shareholders\u2019 equity as\nAOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at September 30, 2020\nincluded $ .7billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for September 30, 2019\nwas $ .3billion .\n\nTable 39 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities as of September 30,\n2020 . These securities are segregated between\ninvestments that had been in a continuous\nunrealized loss position for less than twelve\nmonths and twelve months or more, based on the\npoint in time that the fair value declined\nbelow the amortized cost basis.

Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming\nassets include nonperforming loans and leases,\nOREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming\nloans are those loans accounted for at\namortized cost whose credit quality has\ndeteriorated to the extent that full\ncollection of contractual principal and\ninterest is not probable. Interest income is\nnot recognized on these loans. Loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option are reported\nas performing loans, however, when nonaccrual\ncriteria is met interest income is not\nrecognized on these loans. Additionally,\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfor which we expect to collect substantially\nall principal and interest are not reported as\nnonperforming loans and continue to accrue\ninterest.

To\nevaluate the level of credit risk, we assign\nan internal risk rating reflecting the\nborrower\u2019s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional\ncredit risk rating methodology provides\ngranularity in the risk monitoring process.\nThese ratings are reviewed and updated,\ngenerally at least once per year. For small\nbalance homogeneous pools of commercial and\nindustrial loans and leases, we apply scoring\ntechniques to assist in determining the PD.\nThe combination of the PD and LGD ratings\nassigned to commercial and industrial loans,\ncapturing both the combination of expectations\nof default and loss severity in the event of\ndefault, reflects credit quality\ncharacteristics as of the reporting date and\nare used as inputs into our loss forecasting\nprocess.\n\nBased upon the amount of the lending\narrangement and our risk rating assessment, we\nfollow a formal schedule of written periodic\nreviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews\nof a market\u2019s or business unit\u2019s loan\nportfolio, focusing on those loans which we\nperceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs\nand LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is\nweakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our\npractice to review any customer obligation and\nits level of credit risk more frequently. We\nattempt to proactively manage our loans by\nusing various procedures that are customized\nto the risk of a given loan, including ongoing\noutreach, contact, and assessment of obligor\nfinancial conditions, collateral inspection\nand appraisal.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 73 Commercial Real Estate We manage\ncredit risk associated with our commercial\nreal estate projects and commercial mortgages\nsimilar to commercial and industrial loans by\nevaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with\ncommercial real estate projects and commercial\nmortgage activities tend to be correlated to\nthe loan structure and collateral location,\nproject progress and business environment. As\na result, these attributes are also monitored\nand utilized in assessing credit risk. As with\nthe commercial and industrial loan class, a\nformal schedule of periodic reviews is also\nperformed to assess market/geographic risk and\nbusiness unit/industry risk. Often as a result\nof these overviews, more in-depth reviews and\nincreased scrutiny are placed on areas of\nhigher risk, such as adverse changes in risk\nratings, deteriorating operating trends,\nand/or areas that concern management. These\nreviews are designed to assess risk and\nfacilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\nEquipment Lease Financing We manage credit\nrisk associated with our equipment lease\nfinancing loan class similar to commercial and\nindustrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and\nthe level of credit risk, we follow a formal\nschedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this\noccurs quarterly, although we have established\npractices to review such credit risk more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant. Our\nreview process entails analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual\nvalue, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk,\nindustry risk, guarantor requirements, and\nregulatory compliance as applicable.\nTable 46 : Commercial Credit Quality\nIndicators (a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Dece\u2026                                       \n  31,                                         \n  2019                                        \n  - In         Pass                    Total  \n  mill\u2026       Rated       Criti\u2026       Loans  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  and      $  119,\u2026    $   5,576    $  125,\u2026  \n  indu\u2026                                       \n  Comm\u2026                                       \n  real        27,4\u2026          686       28,1\u2026  \n  esta\u2026                                       \n  Equi\u2026                                       \n  lease       6,891          264       7,155  \n  fina\u2026                                       \n  Total    $  154,\u2026    $   6,526    $  160,\u2026  \n  comm\u2026                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Loans in our commercial portfolio are  \n       classified as Pass Rated or            \n       Criticized based on the regulatory     \n       definitions, which are driven by the   \n       PD and LGD ratings that we assign.     \n       The Criticized classification          \n       includes loans that were rated         \n       special mention, substandard or        \n       doubtful as of September\u00a030, 2020 and  \n  (a)  December 31, 2019.                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nHome Equity and Residential Real Estate\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators,\nincluding delinquency information,\nnonperforming loan information, updated credit\nscores, originated and updated LTV ratios, to\nmonitor and manage credit risk within the home\nequity and residential real estate loan\nclasses. A summary of credit quality\nindicators follows:\n\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor\ntrending of delinquency/delinquency rates for\nhome equity and residential real estate loans.\nSee Table 44 for additional information.\n\nNonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of\nnonperforming loans for home equity and\nresidential real estate loans. See Table 44\nfor additional information.\n\n74 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q Credit Scores: We use a national\nthird-party provider to update FICO credit\nscores for home equity and residential real\nestate loans at least quarterly. The updated\nscores are incorporated into a series of\ncredit management reports, which are utilized\nto monitor the risk in the loan classes. LTV\n(inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV)\nfor first and subordinate lien positions): At\nleast annually, we update the property values\nof real estate collateral and calculate an\nupdated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines\nsecured by real estate in regions experiencing\nsignificant declines in property values, more\nfrequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV\nmigration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes. We use a\ncombination of original LTV and updated LTV\nfor internal risk management and reporting\npurposes ( e.g. , line management, loss\nmitigation strategies). In addition to the\nfact that estimated property values by their\nnature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that\nupdated LTVs may be based upon management\u2019s\nassumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider,\nHPI changes will be incorporated in arriving\nat management\u2019s estimate of updated LTV).\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled\nproperty values. The related estimates and\ninputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation\nmodels, broker price opinions, HPI indices,\nproperty location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and\nmanagement assumptions. We generally utilize\norigination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include\nan amortization assumption when calculating\nupdated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the\ncalculations do not represent actual appraised\nloan level collateral or updated LTV based\nupon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to\nchange as we refine our methodology.\n\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the home equity and residential\nreal estate loan classes.\nTable 47 : Home Equity and Residential Real\nEstate Credit Quality Indicators\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 75\n                                              \n  December                                    \n  31, 2019                        Residenti\u2026  \n  -

For all loan types, we\ngenerally use a combination of internal loan\nparameters as well as an updated FICO score.\nWe use FICO scores as a primary credit quality\nindicator for automobile and credit card\nloans, as well as non-government guaranteed or\nnon-insured education loans and other secured\nand unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit\nmetrics, such as delinquency status, are\nheavily relied upon as credit quality\nindicators for government guaranteed or\ninsured education loans and consumer loans to\nhigh net worth individuals, as internal credit\nmetrics are more relevant than FICO scores for\nthese types of loans.\n\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency\ntrends and losses for each class, FICO credit\nscore updates are obtained at least quarterly\nalong with a variety of credit bureau\nattributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend\nto have a lower likelihood of loss.\nConversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to\nhave a higher likelihood of loss.\n\n76 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nThe following table presents credit quality   \nindicators for the automobile, credit card,   \neducation and other consumer loan classes.    \nTable 48 : Credit Quality Indicators for\nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer Loan Classes\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  -

N OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S\nERVICING A CTIVITIES AND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E\nNTITIES Loan Sale and Servicing Activities As\nmore fully described in Note 2 Loan Sale and\nServicing Activities and Variable Interest\nEntities in our 2019 Form 10-K, we have\ntransferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement. Our continuing involvement\ngenerally consists of servicing, repurchasing\npreviously transferred loans under certain\nconditions and loss share arrangements, and,\nin limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the securitization\nspecial purpose entities (SPEs). We earn\nservicing and other ancillary fees for our\nrole as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 9 Commitments\nand Note 12 Fair Value for information on our\nservicing rights, including the carrying value\nof servicing assets. 80 The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n\nThe following table provides cash flows\nassociated with our loan sale and servicing\nactivities:\nTable 54 : Cash Flows Associated with Loan\nSale and Servicing Activities\n                                              \n  In                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  Cash                                        \n  Flows                                       \n  -

Refer to Note 7 Goodwill\nand Mortgage Servicing Rights in our 2019 Form\n10-K for more information on our accounting\nand measurement of MSRs.\n\nChanges in the commercial and residential MSRs\nfollow:\nTable 57 : Mortgage Servicing Rights\n                                              \n        C\u2026                    \u2026               \n  \u2026     M\u2026                    \u2026               \n  \u2026     2\u2026        2\u2026          \u2026        2\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026  $  6\u2026     $  7\u2026       $  \u2026     $  1\u2026     \n  1                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     65        29          \u2026        23     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     31        76          \u2026        87     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     (\u2026  )     (\u2026  )       \u2026  )     (\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026     (\u2026  )     (\u2026  )       \u2026  )     (\u2026  )  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  5\u2026     $  5\u2026       $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  2\u2026     $  2\u2026       $  \u2026     $  1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026  $  3\u2026     $  1\u2026       $  \u2026     $  1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents decrease in MSR value due   \n       to passage of time, including the      \n  (a)  impact from both regularly scheduled   \n       loan principal payments and loans      \n       that were paid down or paid off        \n       during the period.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents MSR value changes           \n  (b)  resulting primarily from               \n       market-driven changes in interest      \n       rates.                                 \n                                              \nSensitivity Analysis\n\nThe fair value of commercial and residential\nMSRs and significant inputs to the valuation\nmodels as of September 30, 2020 are shown in\nTables 58 and 59 . The expected and actual\nrates of mortgage loan prepayments are\nsignificant factors driving the fair value.\nManagement uses both internal proprietary\nmodels and a third-party model to estimate\nfuture commercial mortgage loan prepayments\nand a third-party model to estimate future\nresidential mortgage loan prepayments. These\nmodels have been refined based on current\nmarket conditions and management judgment.\nFuture interest rates are another important\nfactor in the valuation of MSRs. Management\nutilizes market implied forward interest rates\nto estimate the future direction of mortgage\nand discount rates. The forward rates utilized\nare derived from the current yield curve for\nU.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are\nconsistent with pricing of capital markets\ninstruments. Changes in the shape and slope of\nthe forward curve in future periods may result\nin volatility in the fair value estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 58 and 59 . These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 83 prepayment rate estimates, could\nresult in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities. The following\ntables set forth the fair value of commercial\nand residential MSRs and the sensitivity\nanalysis of the hypothetical effect on the\nfair value of MSRs to immediate adverse\nchanges of 10% and 20% in those assumptions.\nTable 58 : Commercial Mortgage Servicing\nRights \u2013 Key Valuation Assumptions\n                                              \n  Dollars

Approximately 96% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass as of September 30, 2020 , with\nthe remainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them. The standby\nletters of credit outstanding on September 30,\n2020 had terms ranging from less than one year\nto six years.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020 , assets of $\n1.1billion secured certain specifically\nidentified standby letters of credit. In\naddition, a portion of the remaining standby\nletters of credit issued on behalf of specific\ncustomers is also secured by collateral or\nguarantees that secure the customers\u2019 other\nobligations to us. The carrying amount of the\nliability for our obligations related to\nstandby letters of credit and participations\nin standby letters of credit was $ .2billion\nat September 30, 2020 and is included in Other\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q N OTE 10 T OTAL E QUITY A ND O THER\nC OMPREHENSIVE I NCOME Activity in total\nequity for the nine months ended September 30,\n2020 and 2019 is as follows.\nTable 64 : Rollforward of Total Equity\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The par value of our preferred stock   \n  (a)  outstanding was less than$.5millionat  \n       each date and, therefore, is excluded  \n       from this presentation.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       On September 1, 2020, PNC redeemed     \n       all4,800shares of its Series Q         \n  (b)  Preferred Stock, as well as            \n       all19.2millionDepositary Shares        \n       representing fractional interests in   \n       such shares.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the cumulative effect of    \n       adopting ASU 2016-02 -Leasesrelated    \n       primarily to deferred gains on         \n  (c)  previous sale-leaseback transactions.  \n       See the Recently Adopted Accounting    \n       Standards portion of Note 1            \n       Accounting Policies in our 2019 Form   \n       10-K for additional detail.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the cumulative effect of    \n       adopting ASU 2016-13 - Financial       \n       Instruments - Credit Losses.

and\nliabilities at fair value. Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate, and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants.

ERIVATIVES We\nuse a variety of financial derivatives to both\nmitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risk inherent in our\nbusiness activities, as well as, to facilitate\ncustomer risk management activities. We manage\nthese risks as part of our overall asset and\nliability management process and through our\ncredit policies and procedures. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional amount and an\nunderlying as specified in the contract.\nDerivative transactions are often measured in\nterms of notional amount, but this amount is\ngenerally not exchanged and it is not recorded\non the balance sheet. The notional amount is\nthe basis to which the underlying is applied\nto determine required payments under the\nderivative contract. The underlying is a\nreferenced interest rate (commonly LIBOR),\nsecurity price, credit spread or other index.\nResidential and commercial real estate loan\ncommitments associated with loans to be sold\nalso qualify as derivative instruments.

Any nonperformance risk,\nincluding credit risk, is included in the\ndetermination of the estimated net fair value\nof the derivatives.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 101 Derivatives Designated As Hedging\nInstruments Certain derivatives used to manage\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risk as\npart of our asset and liability risk\nmanagement activities are designated as\naccounting hedges. Derivatives hedging the\nrisks associated with changes in the fair\nvalue of assets or liabilities are considered\nfair value hedges, derivatives hedging the\nvariability of expected future cash flows are\nconsidered cash flow hedges, and derivatives\nhedging a net investment in a foreign\nsubsidiary are considered net investment\nhedges. Designating derivatives as accounting\nhedges allows for gains and losses on those\nderivatives to be recognized in the same\nperiod and in the same income statement line\nitem as the earnings impact of the hedged\nitems. Fair Value Hedges We enter into\nreceive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\noutstanding fixed-rate debt caused by\nfluctuations in market interest rates. We also\nenter into pay-fixed, receive-variable\ninterest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to\nhedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate\nand zero-coupon investment securities caused\nby fluctuations in market interest rates.\nGains and losses on the interest rate swaps\ndesignated in these hedge relationships, along\nwith the offsetting gains and losses on the\nhedged items attributable to the hedged risk,\nare recognized in current earnings within the\nsame income statement line item. Cash Flow\nHedges We enter into receive-fixed, pay-\nvariable interest rate swaps to modify the\ninterest rate characteristics of designated\ncommercial loans from variable to fixed in\norder to reduce the impact of changes in\nfuture cash flows due to market interest rate\nchanges. We also periodically enter into\nforward purchase and sale contracts to hedge\nthe variability of the consideration that will\nbe paid or received related to the purchase or\nsale of investment securities. The forecasted\npurchase or sale is consummated upon gross\nsettlement of the forward contract itself. For\nthese cash flow hedges, gains and losses on\nthe interest rate swaps and forward contracts\nare recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified\ninto earnings in the same period the hedged\ncash flows affect earnings and within the same\nincome statement line as the hedged cash\nflows. In the 12 months that follow September\n30, 2020 , we expect to reclassify net\nderivative gains of $ 402million pretax, or $\n310million after-tax, from AOCI to interest\nincome for both cash flow hedge strategies.\nThis reclassified amount could differ from\namounts actually recognized due to changes in\ninterest rates, hedge de-designations and the\naddition of other hedges subsequent to\nSeptember 30, 2020 . As of September 30, 2020\n, the maximum length of time over which\nforecasted transactions are hedged is ten\nyears. 102 The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. \u2013 Form 10-Q\n\nFurther detail

net investments in foreign\nsubsidiaries against adverse changes in\nforeign exchange rates. We assess whether the\nhedging relationship is highly effective in\nachieving offsetting changes in the value of\nthe hedge and hedged item by qualitatively\nverifying that the critical terms of the hedge\nand hedged item match at the inception of the\nhedging relationship and on an ongoing basis.\nNet investment hedge derivatives are\nclassified as foreign exchange contracts.\nThere were no components of derivative gains\nor losses excluded from the assessment of the\nhedge effectiveness for all periods presented.\nGains (losses) on net investment hedge\nderivatives recognized in OCI

Sheet for those\nderivative financial instruments entered into\nwith counterparties under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements. The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting, counterparty credit risk and\ncontingent features, see Note 13 Financial\nDerivatives in our 2019 Form 10-K.\n\nTable 80 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nas of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019\n. The table includes cash collateral held or\npledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements. The table also includes\nthe fair value of any securities collateral\nheld or pledged under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements. Cash and securities\ncollateral amounts are included in the table\nonly to the extent of the related net\nderivative fair values.\n\nTable 80 includes over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives and OTC derivatives cleared\nthrough a central clearing house. OTC\nderivatives represent contracts executed\nbilaterally with counterparties that are not\nsettled through an organized exchange or\ndirectly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (ISDA) documentation\nor other legally enforceable master netting\nagreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent\ncontracts executed bilaterally with\ncounterparties in the OTC market that are\nnovated to a central clearing house who then\nbecomes our counterparty. OTC cleared\nderivative instruments are typically settled\nin cash each day based on the prior day value.\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nTable 80 : Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the net amount of           \n  (a)  derivative assets included in Other    \n       assets on our Consolidated Balance     \n       Sheet.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the net amount of           \n  (b)  derivative liabilities included in     \n       Other liabilities on our Consolidated  \n       Balance Sheet.                         \n                                              \nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt September 30, 2020 , we held cash, U.S.\ngovernment securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities totaling $ 2.6billion under master\nnetting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties, and we pledged\ncash totaling $ 2.1billion under these\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nliabilities owed to counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements. These totals may\ndiffer from the amounts presented in the\npreceding offsetting table because these\ntotals may include collateral exchanged under\nan agreement that does not qualify as a master\nnetting agreement or because the total amount\nof collateral held or pledged exceeds the net\nderivative fair values with the counterparty\nas of the balance sheet date due to timing or\nother factors, such as initial margin. To the\nextent not netted against the derivative fair\nvalues under a master netting agreement, the\nreceivable for cash pledged is included in\nOther assets and the obligation for cash held\nis included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held\nfrom counterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n10-Q 105 Certain derivative agreements contain\nvarious credit-risk related contingent\nprovisions, such as those that require our\ndebt to maintain a specified credit rating\nfrom one or more of the major credit rating\nagencies. If our debt ratings were to fall\nbelow such specified ratings, the\ncounterparties to the derivative instruments\ncould request immediate payment or demand\nimmediate and ongoing full collateralization\non derivative instruments in net liability\npositions. The aggregate fair value of all\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features that were in a net\nliability position on September 30, 2020 was $\n2.9billion for which we had posted collateral\nof $ 2.6billion in the normal course of\nbusiness. The maximum additional amount of\ncollateral we would have been required to post\nif the credit-risk-related contingent features\nunderlying these agreements had been triggered\non September 30, 2020 would be $ .3billion . N\nOTE 14 L EGAL P ROCEEDINGS We establish\naccruals for legal proceedings, including\nlitigation and regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations and inquiries, when information\nrelated to the loss contingencies represented\nby those matters indicates both that a loss is\nprobable and that the amount of loss can be\nreasonably estimated. Any such accruals are\nadjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect\nchanged circumstances. When we are able to do\nso, we also determine estimates of possible\nlosses or ranges of possible losses, whether\nin excess of any related accrued liability or\nwhere there is no accrued liability, for\ndisclosed legal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed\nMatters,\u201d which are those matters disclosed in\nthis Note 14 as well as those matters\ndisclosed in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in Part\nII, Item 8 of our 2019 Form 10-K, in Note 13\nLegal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our\nfirst quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, and in Note 14\nLegal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our\nsecond quarter 2020 Form 10-Q (such prior\ndisclosure referred to as \u201cPrior\nDisclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters where we\nare able to estimate such possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, as of September 30,\n2020 , we estimate that it is reasonably\npossible that we could incur losses in excess\nof related accrued liabilities, if any, in an\naggregate amount less than $ 100million . The\nestimates included in this amount are based on\nour analysis of currently available\ninformation and are subject to significant\njudgment and a variety of assumptions and\nuncertainties. As new information is obtained\nwe may change our estimates. Due to the\ninherent subjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of outcomes of legal\nproceedings, any amounts accrued or included\nin this aggregate amount may not represent the\nultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings\nin question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount. As a result of the\ntypes of factors described in Note 19 in our\n2019 Form 10-K, we are unable, at this time,\nto estimate the losses that are reasonably\npossible to be incurred or ranges of such\nlosses with respect to some of the matters\ndisclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount\nprovided above does not include an estimate\nfor every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the\nestimated aggregate amount disclosed above\ndoes not include all of the Disclosed Matters,\nthe amount disclosed above does not represent\nour maximum reasonably possible loss exposure\nfor all of the Disclosed Matters. The\nestimated aggregate amount also does not\nreflect any of our exposure to matters not so\ndisclosed, as discussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual. Some of our exposure in Disclosed\nMatters may be offset by applicable insurance\ncoverage. We do not consider the possible\navailability of insurance coverage in\ndetermining the amounts of any accruals\n(although we record the amount of related\ninsurance recoveries that are deemed probable\nup to the amount of the accrual) or in\ndetermining any estimates of possible losses\nor ranges of possible losses. USAA Patent\nInfringement Litigation In September 2020, a\nlawsuit (United Services Automobile\nAssociation v. PNC Bank N.A., Case No.\n2:20-cv-319) was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement. The plaintiff alleges that PNC\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit capture systems infringe\non two patents owned by the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff seeks, among other things, a\njudgment that PNC is infringing each of the\npatents, damages for infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. Other Regulatory and\nGovernmental Inquiries We are the subject of\ninvestigations, audits, examinations and other\nforms of regulatory and governmental inquiry\ncovering a broad range of issues in our\nconsumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and\nother financial services businesses, as well\nas other aspects of our operations. In some\ncases, these inquiries are part of reviews of\nspecified activities at multiple industry\nparticipants; in others, they are directed at\nPNC individually. From time to time, these\ninquiries, including those described in Prior\nDisclosure, may involve or lead to regulatory\nenforcement actions and other administrative\nproceedings, and may lead to civil or criminal\njudicial proceedings. Some of these inquiries\nresult in remedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral 106 The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. \u2013 Form 10-Q costs and other\nconsequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences. Our practice is to cooperate\nfully with regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations, audits and other inquiries,\nincluding those described in Prior Disclosure.\nOther In addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod. N OTE 15 S EGMENT R EPORTING\n\nWe have three reportable business segments:\n                     \n  \u2022  Retail Banking  \n                     \n                                        \n  \u2022  Corporate & Institutional Banking  \n                                        \n                             \n  \u2022  Asset Management Group  \n                             \nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock. See \nNote 2 Discontinued Operations for additional \ninformation on the sale and details on our    \nresults and cash flows for the three and nine \nmonths ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.     \nFollowing the sale and donation, PNC only     \nholds shares of BlackRock stock in a fiduciary\ncapacity for clients of PNC.                  \nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income.\nThese differences are reflected in the \u201cOther\u201d\ncategory in Table 81 . \u201cOther\u201d includes\nresidual activities that do not meet the\ncriteria for disclosure as a separate\nreportable business, such as asset and\nliability management activities including net\nsecurities gains or losses, ACL for investment\nsecurities, certain trading activities,\ncertain runoff consumer loan portfolios,\nprivate equity investments, intercompany\neliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax\nadjustments that are not allocated to business\nsegments, exited businesses and differences\nbetween business segment performance reporting\nand financial statement reporting (GAAP),\nincluding the presentation of net income\nattributable to noncontrolling interests as\nthe segments\u2019 results exclude their portion of\nnet income attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests. The \u201cOther\u201d category also includes\nour BlackRock held for sale asset. Assets,\nrevenue and earnings attributable to foreign\nactivities were not material in the period\npresented for comparison.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstand-alone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology.
