See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report for additional\ninformation regarding our regulatory matters.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our\npermissible activities and investments, impose\nconditions and requirements on the products\nand services we offer and the manner in which\nthey are offered and sold, and require\ncompliance with protections for loan, deposit,\nbrokerage, fiduciary, investment management\nand other customers, among other things. They\nalso restrict our ability to repurchase stock\nor pay dividends, or to receive dividends from\nour bank subsidiary, and impose capital\nadequacy and liquidity requirements. The\nconsequences of noncompliance with these, or\nother applicable laws or regulations, can\ninclude substantial monetary and nonmonetary\nsanctions.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive\nsupervision and examination by, among other\nregulatory bodies, the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC. These examinations consider not only\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations\nand supervisory policies of the agency, but\nalso capital levels, asset quality, risk\nmanagement effectiveness, the ability and\nperformance of management and the board of\ndirectors, the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols and internal audit function,\nearnings, liquidity and various other factors.\n\nThe results of examination activity by any of\nour federal bank regulators potentially can\nresult in the imposition of significant\nlimitations on our activities and growth.\nThese regulatory agencies generally have broad\ndiscretion to impose restrictions and\nlimitations on the operations of a regulated\nentity and take enforcement action, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements,\nagainst a regulated entity where the relevant\nagency determines, among other things, that\nthe operations of the regulated entity or any\nof its subsidiaries fail to comply with\napplicable law or regulations, are conducted\nin an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent\nan unfair or deceptive act or practice. This\nsupervisory framework, including the\nexamination reports and supervisory ratings\n(which are not publicly available) of the\nagencies, could materially impact the conduct,\ngrowth and profitability of our operations.\n\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws, including the laws\nrelating to fair lending and prohibiting\nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\nin connection with the offer, sale or\nprovision of consumer financial products or\nservices, and for enforcing such laws with\nrespect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The\nresults of the CFPB\u2019s examinations (which are\nnot publicly available) also can result in\nrestrictions or limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity as well as enforcement\nactions against a regulated entity, including\nthe imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements.\n\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC\nby virtue of our status as a public company\nand by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature\nof some of our businesses. Our businesses with\noperations outside the U.S. also are subject\nto regulation by appropriate authorities in\nthe foreign jurisdictions in which they do\nbusiness.\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our\nrelationships and good standing with\nregulators are of fundamental importance to\nthe operation and growth of our businesses.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and\nother domestic and foreign regulators have\nbroad enforcement powers, and certain of the\nregulators have the power to approve, deny, or\nrefuse to act upon our applications or notices\nto conduct new activities, acquire or divest\nbusinesses, assets or deposits, expand our\noperations geographically or reconfigure\nexisting operations.\n\n2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a\nhigh level of regulatory focus are compliance\nwith the BSA and anti-money laundering laws,\ncapital and liquidity management (including\nstress testing), the structure and\neffectiveness of enterprise risk management\nframeworks, the management of risks associated\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, the protection of\nconfidential customer information, cyber\nsecurity, the oversight of arrangements with\nthird-party vendors and suppliers, and\ncompliance with fair lending and other\nconsumer protection laws and regulations,\nincluding those governing retail sales\npractices, fee disclosures, unfair, deceptive\nor abusive acts or practices, collection\npractices, and protections for military\nservice members and individuals in bankruptcy.\n\nNew legislation, changes in rules promulgated\nby federal financial regulators, other federal\nand state regulatory authorities and self-\nregulatory organizations, or changes in the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing laws\nand rules, may directly affect the operations\nand profitability of our businesses. We\nanticipate new legislative and regulatory\ninitiatives over the next several years,\nfocused specifically on banking and other\nfinancial services in which we are engaged.\nLegislative and regulatory developments to\ndate, as well as those that come in the\nfuture, have had and are likely to continue to\nhave an impact on the conduct of our business.\nThe more detailed description of the\nsignificant regulations to which we are\nsubject included in this Report is based on\ncurrent laws and regulations and is subject to\npotentially material change. See also the\nadditional information included as Risk\nFactors in Item 1A of this Report discussing\nthe impact of financial regulatory initiatives\non the regulatory environment for us and the\nfinancial services industry.\n\nThe profitability of our businesses also is\naffected by rules and regulations that impact\nthe business and financial sectors in general,\nincluding laws governing taxation, antitrust\nregulation, electronic commerce, data security\nand privacy.\n\nThere are numerous rules governing the\nregulation of financial services institutions\nand their holding companies. Accordingly, the\nfollowing discussion is general in nature and\ndoes not purport to be complete or to describe\nall of the laws, regulations and policies that\napply to us. To a substantial extent, the\npurpose of the regulation and supervision of\nfinancial services institutions and their\nholding companies is not to protect our\nshareholders and our non-customer creditors,\nbut rather to protect our customers (including\ndepositors), the financial markets and\nfinancial system in general.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation and Supervision          \n                                              \nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress\nTesting and Capital Planning . PNC and PNC\nBank are subject to the regulatory capital\nrequirements established by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC, respectively. The\nfoundation of the agencies\u2019 regulatory capital\nrules is the international regulatory capital\nframework developed by the Basel Committee,\nthe international body responsible for\ndeveloping global regulatory standards for\nbanking organizations for consideration and\nadoption by national jurisdictions. The\nregulatory capital rules establish minimum\nrequirements for the ratio of a banking\norganization\u2019s regulatory capital to its risk-\nweighted assets, referred to as risk-based\ncapital requirements, as well as for the ratio\nof its regulatory capital to measures of\nassets and other exposures, referred to as\nleverage capital requirements. The agencies\u2019\nregulatory capital rules have undergone\nsignificant change since 2013, when the\nagencies adopted final rules to implement the\nBasel Committee\u2019s international regulatory\ncapital framework, known as \u201cBasel III\u201d, as\nwell as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nAct.\n\nIn 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted\nrules to better tailor the application of\ntheir capital, liquidity and enhanced\nprudential requirements for banking\norganizations to the asset size and risk\nprofile (as measured by certain regulatory\nmetrics) of the banking organization (the\n\u201c2019 Tailoring Rules\u201d). Effective January 1,\n2020, the agencies\u2019 capital and liquidity\nrules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or\nmore in total assets into one of four\ncategories (Category I, Category II, Category\nIII and Category IV), with the most stringent\ncapital and liquidity requirements applying to\nCategory I firms and the least restrictive\nrequirements applying to Category IV firms.\nThe classification of any bank subsidiary of a\nBHC generally follows that of its parent BHC.\nPNC and PNC Bank currently are Category III\nfirms because PNC (i) has more than $250\nbillion, but less than $700 billion, in\nconsolidated total assets, (ii) is not\ndesignated as a GSIB, and (iii) has less than\n$75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity.\nPNC and PNC Bank would become a Category I or\nII institution, and subject to more stringent\ncapital and liquidity standards, if PNC were\nat some point in the future to have $700\nbillion or more in total consolidated assets,\nbe designated as a GSIB, or have $75 billion\nor more in cross-jurisdictional activity. As\nof December 31, 2021, PNC had cross-\njurisdictional activities for these purposes\nof $21.4 billion.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide\nregulatory capital into three components: CET1\ncapital, additional Tier 1 capital (which,\ntogether with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1\ncapital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is\ngenerally common stock, retained earnings, and\nqualifying minority interest less required\ndeductions. As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank\nhave elected to exclude AOCI related to both\navailable for sale securities and pension and\nother post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.\nAdditional Tier 1 capital generally includes,\namong other things, perpetual preferred stock\nand qualifying minority interests, less\nrequired deductions. Tier 2 capital generally\ncomprises qualifying subordinated debt and,\nsubject to certain quantitative limits, ACL,\nless any required deductions from Tier 2\ncapital. The regulatory capital rules limit\nthe extent to which minority interests in\nconsolidated subsidiaries may be included in\nregulatory capital. Total capital is the sum\nof Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, PNC and\nPNC Bank must deduct investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs\nand deferred tax assets (in each case, net of\nassociated deferred tax liabilities) from CET1\ncapital to the extent such items individually\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                   Form 10-K 3\nexceed 25% of the institution\u2019s adjusted CET1\ncapital. As of December 31, 2021, PNC and PNC\nBank\u2019s investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets did\nnot exceed this threshold.\n\nThe agencies\u2019 capital rules also permit\nbanking organizations to elect to phase-in, on\na straight-line basis over a three-year\nperiod, the day-one regulatory capital effects\nof implementing the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board\u2019s ASU 2016-13 Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),\ncommonly referred to as the CECL standard. PNC\nimplemented the CECL standard effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, but elected not to implement\nthe phase-in of the day-one regulatory capital\neffects of the standard. Separately, the\nfederal banking agencies adopted a rule that\npermits banking organizations that are subject\nto CECL during 2020 to delay CECL\u2019s estimated\nimpact on CET1 capital. CECL\u2019s estimated\nimpact on CET1 capital is the change in\nretained earnings at adoption plus or minus\n25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance\nsheet date compared to CECL ACL at transition.\nFor institutions electing to utilize this CECL\ntransition rule for regulatory capital, the\nestimated CECL impact was added to CET1\nthrough December 31, 2021, and will be phased-\nout over the following three years. PNC and\nPNC Bank have elected this five-year\ntransition period effective March 31, 2020,\nwhich impacts the regulatory capital ratios\ndisclosed in this Report. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for more detail on the CECL\nstandard.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the\nstandardized approach for determining a\nbanking organization\u2019s risk-weighted assets\nfor purposes of calculating the risk-based\ncapital ratios. The standardized approach for\nrisk-weighted assets takes into account credit\nand market risk. To calculate risk-weighted\nassets under the standardized approach for\ncredit risk, the nominal dollar amounts of\nassets and credit equivalent amounts of off-\nbalance sheet items are generally multiplied\nby risk weights set forth in the rules, with\nthe risk weights increasing as the perceived\ncredit risk of the relevant asset or exposure\nincreases. For certain types of exposures,\nsuch as securitization exposures, the\nstandardized approach establishes one or more\nmethodologies that are to be used to calculate\nthe risk-weighted asset amount for the\nexposure. High volatility commercial real\nestate, past due, and equity exposures, as\nwell as MSRs and deferred tax assets that are\nnot deducted from capital, are generally\nsubject to higher risk weights than other\ntypes of exposures. Under the market risk\ncapital rule, risk-weighted asset amounts for\ncovered trading positions are determined based\non the calculation of VaR (including stressed\nVaR), specific risk, incremental risk and\ncomprehensive risk amounts, as specified in\nthe capital rules.\n\nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated\nusing the definition of capital under the\nagencies\u2019 Basel III capital rules and, for the\nrisk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted\nassets, as our Basel III regulatory capital\nratios.\n\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain\nminimum standards for the capital ratios of\nbanking organizations, including PNC and PNC\nBank. Banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital\nratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of\n8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-\nweighted assets, to be considered \u201cadequately\ncapitalized.\u201d In 2020, the Federal Reserve\nintroduced a CET1 SCB for BHCs subject to the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process, such as PNC.\nThe SCB is calculated based on the difference\nbetween a firm\u2019s starting and minimum CET1\nratio (as projected by the Federal Reserve) in\nthe supervisory severely adverse scenario\nduring the CCAR process, plus four quarters of\nthe organization\u2019s planned common stock\ndividends (expressed as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets), subject to a floor of 2.5%.\nBased on PNC\u2019s performance under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests as part of\nCCAR 2021, PNC\u2019s SCB for the period from the\nfourth quarter of 2021 through the third\nquarter of 2022 was set at 2.5%. While PNC\nBank is not subject to a SCB, PNC Bank is\nrequired to maintain a capital conservation\nbuffer in the form of CET1 equal to a fixed\n2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based\ncapital above the minimum risk-based capital\nratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case\nof PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the\ncase of PNC Bank) in order to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and repurchases of any\nTier 1 capital instrument, such as common and\nqualifying preferred stock and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nAs a result, PNC and PNC Bank must maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 10.5% to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary incentive compensation\npayments. Because PNC\u2019s SCB is established as\npart of the CCAR process, and is based on\nPNC\u2019s projected performance (as determined by\nthe Federal Reserve) under the relevant\nsupervisory severely adverse scenario (which\ncan change, potentially materially, from\nstress test to stress test), PNC\u2019s SCB may\nvary, potentially materially, over time and,\nthus, PNC may be required to maintain capital\nabove these levels to avoid limitations on\ncapital distributions and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nIn addition, while a firm\u2019s SCB is typically\ndetermined as part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nannual CCAR process, the Federal Reserve has\nthe right to conduct supervisory stress tests,\nrequire a firm to submit a revised capital\nplan and calculate a firm\u2019s SCB more\nfrequently. BHCs subject to a SCB, such as\nPNC, generally may increase their capital\ndistributions without seeking prior Federal\nReserve approval, provided the BHC otherwise\ncomplies with its SCB and any other applicable\ncapital or capital distribution requirements.\n\nFor Category III banking organizations (such\nas PNC and PNC Bank), the Federal Reserve can\nsupplement these higher SCB or capital\nconservation buffer levels above the\nregulatory minimums by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer, which must\nbe held in the form of CET1 capital, is\ncurrently set at zero in the U.S. A Federal\nReserve policy statement establishes the\nframework and factors the Federal Reserve\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nthe U.S. countercyclical capital buffer.\nCovered banking organizations would generally\nhave 12 months after the announcement of any\nincrease in the countercyclical capital buffer\nto meet the increased buffer requirement,\nunless the Federal Reserve establishes an\nearlier effective date.\n\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that\nbanking organizations maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to\naverage consolidated assets, referred to as\nthe leverage ratio, and require Category III\nbanking organizations to maintain a minimum\namount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total\nleverage exposure, referred to as the\nsupplementary leverage ratio. Total leverage\nexposure takes into account on-balance sheet\nassets as well as certain off-balance sheet\nitems, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure under derivative\ncontracts. Banking organizations are required\nto maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to total assets of 4.0%, and Category\nIII banking organizations must maintain a\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the leverage and\nsupplementary leverage ratios of PNC and PNC\nBank were above the required minimum level.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are not subject to the\nadditional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum\nlong-term debt requirement, minimum total\nloss-absorbing capacity or enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirements that\napply to U.S. GSIBs. However, it is possible\nthat the agencies will consider applying one\nor more of these requirements in the future to\na larger subset of BHCs or insured depository\ninstitutions like PNC and PNC Bank.\n\nFailure to meet applicable capital\nrequirements could subject a banking\norganization to a variety of enforcement\nremedies available to the federal banking\nagencies, including a limitation on the\nability to pay dividends or repurchase shares,\nthe issuance of a capital directive to\nincrease capital and, in severe cases, the\ntermination of deposit insurance by the FDIC\nand the appointment of a conservator or\nreceiver. In some cases, the extent of these\npowers depends upon whether the institution in\nquestion is considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\n\u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d The thresholds\nat which an insured depository institution is\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d are based on (i)\nthe institution\u2019s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-\nbased capital ratios; (ii) the institution\u2019s\nleverage ratio; and (iii) for the definitions\nof \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cundercapitalized\u201d, the institution\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio (if applicable).\nGenerally, the smaller an institution\u2019s\ncapital base in relation to its risk-weighted\nor total assets, the greater the scope and\nseverity of the agencies\u2019 powers. Business\nactivities may also be affected by an\ninstitution\u2019s capital classification. For\nexample, as a financial holding company, PNC\nand PNC Bank must remain \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\n\nAt December 31, 2021, PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the required ratios for\nclassification as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For\nadditional discussion of capital adequacy\nrequirements, including the levels of capital\nrequired to be considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d\nsee the Liquidity and Capital Management\nportion of the Risk Management section of Item\n7 of this Report and Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nIn addition to regulatory capital\nrequirements, we are subject to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital plan rule, capital stress\ntesting requirements and CCAR process, as well\nas the DFAST requirements of the Federal\nReserve and the OCC.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal\nReserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of\nthe capital planning process of BHCs,\nincluding PNC, that have $100 billion or more\nin total consolidated assets. For us, this\ncapital planning assessment is based on a\nreview of a comprehensive capital plan\nsubmitted to the Federal Reserve that\ndescribes the company\u2019s planned capital\nactions, such as plans to pay or increase\ncommon stock dividends, engage in common stock\nrepurchase programs, or issue or redeem\npreferred stock or other regulatory capital\ninstruments during a nine quarter review\nperiod, as well as the results of stress tests\nconducted by both the company and the Federal\nReserve under different hypothetical\nmacroeconomic scenarios, including a\nsupervisory severely adverse scenario provided\nby the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve\u2019s\ncapital plan rule provides that a BHC must\nresubmit a new capital plan prior to the next\nannual submission date if, among other things,\nthere has been or will be a material change in\nthe BHC\u2019s risk profile, financial condition or\ncorporate structure since its last capital\nplan submission.\n\nIn evaluating PNC\u2019s capital plan, the Federal\nReserve also considers a number of qualitative\nfactors. In assessing a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes, the Federal\nReserve considers whether the BHC has sound\nand effective governance to oversee these\nprocesses. The Federal Reserve\u2019s evaluation\nfocuses on whether a BHC\u2019s capital planning\nand stress testing processes are supported by\na strong risk management framework to\nidentify, measure and assess material risks\nand that provides a strong foundation to\ncapital planning. The Federal Reserve also\nconsiders the comprehensiveness of a BHC\u2019s\ncontrol framework and evaluates a BHC\u2019s policy\nguidelines for capital planning and assessing\ncapital adequacy. A BHC\u2019s stress testing\nscenario design processes and approaches for\nestimating the impact of stress on its capital\nposition, including stress testing models and\nnon-model qualitative approaches, are\ncomprehensively reviewed to ensure that\nprojections reflect the impact of\nappropriately stressful conditions, as well as\nrisks idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital\nposition. Significant deficiencies in a BHC\u2019s\ncapital planning and stress testing processes\nmay result in supervisory directives that\nrequire the firm to address the identified\ndeficiencies and, potentially, a downgrade in\nthe BHC\u2019s supervisory capital positions and\nplanning rating.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                   Form 10-K 5\nIn connection with the 2022 CCAR exercise, we\nmust file our capital plan and stress testing\nresults using financial data as of December\n31, 2021, with the Federal Reserve by April 6,\n2022. In June 2022, we expect to receive PNC\u2019s\npreliminary SCB for the period from the fourth\nquarter of 2022 through the third quarter of\n2023. The Federal Reserve must provide firms\ntheir final SCB for this period by August 31,\n2022, which would reflect any changes made to\nthe firm\u2019s planned common stock dividends to\nremain in compliance with the firm\u2019s SCB.\n\nAs part of the annual CCAR and DFAST\nprocesses, the Federal Reserve releases\ncertain revenue, loss and capital results for\neach participating firm from its supervisory\nstress testing exercises. As a Category III\ninstitution, PNC must conduct a company-run\nDFAST stress test biennially in even numbered\nyears and release PNC\u2019s projections of certain\nrevenue, loss and capital results from the\nexercise under the agencies\u2019 hypothetical\nsupervisory severely adverse macroeconomic\nscenario and applying the agencies\u2019 DFAST\ncapital action assumptions.\n\nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity\nRisk Management Requirements . The Basel\nCommittee\u2019s Basel III framework also includes\nshort-term liquidity standards (LCR) and long-\nterm funding standards (NSFR).\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies\u2019 LCR rules are\ndesigned to ensure that covered banking\norganizations maintain an adequate level of\ncash and high-quality liquid assets to meet\nestimated net liquidity needs in a short-term\nstress scenario using liquidity inflow and\noutflow assumptions prescribed in the rules\n(net cash outflow). A company\u2019s LCR is the\namount of its high-quality liquid assets\ndivided by its net cash outflows, expressed as\na percentage, and as calculated under the\nrules. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered\nbanking organizations are required to maintain\nis 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to\ncalculate the LCR on a daily basis. If either\ninstitution\u2019s LCR is below the minimum\nrequirement for three consecutive business\ndays, the institution must promptly provide\nits regulator with a plan for achieving\ncompliance with the minimum LCR requirement.\nAt December 31, 2021, the LCR for PNC and PNC\nBank exceeded the required minimum levels.\n\nThe NSFR, which became effective on July 1,\n2021, is designed to measure the stability of\nthe maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. A covered BHC\u2019s NSFR is\nthe ratio of its available stable funding to\nits required stable funding amount (as\ncalculated under the rules) over a one-year\nhorizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all\ncovered banking organizations (expressed as a\npercentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are\nrequired to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing\nbasis. If either institution\u2019s NSFR falls, or\nis likely to fall below, the minimum\nrequirement, the institution must provide its\nregulator with a plan for achieving compliance\nwith the minimum NSFR requirement. At December\n31, 2021, the NSFR for PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the required minimum levels.\n\nAs Category III institutions with less than\n$75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale\nfunding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to\nreduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each\ncompany\u2019s LCR net outflows and required stable\nfunding (as calculated under the rules)\nreduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of\nhigh-quality liquid assets or available stable\nfunding each institution must hold to meet the\nLCR and NSFR minimum requirements,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2021, PNC had\nweighted short-term wholesale funding for\nthese purposes of $32.5 billion.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs,\nincluding PNC, to publicly disclose certain\nquantitative and qualitative measures of their\nLCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These\ndisclosures include major components used to\ncalculate the LCR and NSFR (e.g., high-quality\nliquid assets, cash outflows and inflows for\nthe LCR, and available stable funding and\nrequired stable funding for the NSFR, at the\nconsolidated parent company), and a\nqualitative discussion of the BHC\u2019s LCR and\nNSFR results, including, among other things,\nkey drivers of the results, composition of\nhigh-quality liquid assets and available\nstable funding, and concentration of funding\nsources.\n\nAdditionally, as a Category III institution,\nPNC also is subject to Federal Reserve rules\nthat require PNC to, among other things,\nconduct internal liquidity stress tests over a\nrange of time horizons, maintain a buffer of\nhighly liquid assets sufficient to meet\nprojected net outflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day\nliquidity stress test and maintain a\ncontingency funding plan that meets certain\nrequirements.\n\nFor additional discussion of regulatory\nliquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and\nDividends . The principal source of our\nliquidity at the parent company level is\ndividends from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject\nto various restrictions on its ability to pay\ndividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct\nparent, which is a wholly-owned direct\nsubsidiary of The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. PNC Bank is also subject to\nfederal laws limiting extensions of credit to\nits parent holding company and non-bank\naffiliates as discussed in Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters in the\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report. Further information on\nbank level liquidity and parent company\nliquidity is also available in the Liquidity\nand Capital Management portion of the Risk\nManagement section of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is\nexpected to serve as a source of financial\nstrength to its subsidiary banks and to commit\nresources to support such banks if necessary.\nDodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve\njointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the\nFDIC to implement this source of strength\nrequirement. These joint rules have not yet\nbeen proposed. Consistent with this source of\nstrength policy for subsidiary banks, the\nFederal Reserve has stated that, as a matter\nof prudent banking, a BHC generally should not\nmaintain a rate of cash dividends unless its\nnet income available to common shareholders\nhas been sufficient to fully fund the\ndividends and the prospective rate of earnings\nretention appears to be consistent with the\ncorporation\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and\noverall financial condition. Further, in\nproviding guidance to the large BHCs\nparticipating in the CCAR exercise, such as\nPNC as discussed above, the Federal Reserve\nhas expected capital plans to reflect\nconservative dividend payout ratios.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Requirements . Under\nFederal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with\ntotal consolidated assets of $100 billion or\nmore are subject to various enhanced\nprudential standards related to liquidity risk\nmanagement and overall risk management. For\nPNC, these rules, among other things,\nestablish liquidity stress testing\nrequirements (discussed above), limitations on\nPNC\u2019s aggregate net credit exposures to any\nsingle, unaffiliated company (referred to as\nthe single counterparty credit limit (SCCL)),\nand certain oversight and governance\nresponsibilities for PNC\u2019s Chief Risk Officer,\nthe Board of Directors, and the Risk Committee\nof the Board of Directors. Under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s SCCL rules, PNC\u2019s aggregate net\ncredit exposure (including exposure resulting\nfrom, among other transactions, extensions of\ncredit, repurchase and reverse repurchase\ntransactions, investments in securities and\nderivative transactions) to any unaffiliated\ncounterparty may not exceed 25% of PNC\u2019s Tier\n1 capital.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is required to impose a\nmaximum 15-to-1 debt to equity ratio on a BHC\nif the federal agencies that comprise the FSOC\ndetermine that the company poses a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\nand that the imposition of such a debt-to-\nequity requirement would mitigate such risk.\nThe Federal Reserve also is required to\nestablish early remediation requirements for\nBHCs with more than $250 billion in total\nassets and continues to work towards\nfinalizing these requirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop\nthe set of enhanced prudential standards that\napply to large BHCs in order to further\npromote the resiliency of such firms and the\nU.S. financial system. For additional\ninformation, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this\nReport.\n\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act . The GLB\nAct permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to\nbecome a \u201cfinancial holding company\u201d and\nthereby engage in, or affiliate with companies\nengaging in, a broader range of financial\nactivities than would otherwise be permitted\nfor a BHC. Permitted affiliates include\nsecurities underwriters and dealers, insurance\ncompanies, insurance agents and companies\nengaged in other activities that are\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of the\nTreasury, to be \u201cfinancial in nature or\nincidental thereto\u201d or are determined by the\nFederal Reserve unilaterally to be\n\u201ccomplementary\u201d to financial activities. We\nbecame a financial holding company in 2000. A\nBHC qualifies to become a financial holding\ncompany if the BHC and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions are \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nand \u201cwell managed\u201d and its subsidiary\ndepository institutions have a rating under\nthe CRA of Satisfactory or better. Among other\nactivities, we currently rely on our status as\na financial holding company to conduct\nmerchant banking activities and securities\nunderwriting and dealing activities. As\nsubsidiaries of a financial holding company\nunder the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries\nare generally allowed to conduct new financial\nactivities, and we generally are permitted to\nacquire non-bank financial companies that have\nless than $10 billion in assets, with after-\nthe-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying\nnational banks to engage in expanded\nactivities through a \u201cfinancial subsidiary.\u201d\nPNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary\ncertification with the OCC and currently\nengages in insurance agency activities through\nfinancial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also\ngenerally engage through a financial\nsubsidiary in any activity that is determined\nto be financial in nature or incidental to a\nfinancial activity by the Secretary of the\nTreasury, in consultation with the Federal\nReserve (other than insurance underwriting\nactivities, insurance company investment\nactivities and merchant banking). In order to\nestablish a financial subsidiary, a national\nbank and each of its depository institution\naffiliates must be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and\n\u201cwell managed\u201d and the national bank and each\nof its depository institution affiliates must\nhave a CRA rating of Satisfactory or better.\n\nIf a financial holding company or a national\nbank with a financial subsidiary fails to\ncontinue to meet the applicable \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d or \u201cwell managed\u201d criteria, the\nfinancial holding company or national bank\nmust enter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among\nother things, identifies how the capital or\nmanagement deficiencies will be corrected.\nUntil such deficiencies are corrected, the\nrelevant agency may impose limits or\nconditions on the activities of the company or\nbank, and the company or bank may not engage\nin, or acquire a company engaged in, the types\nof expanded activities only permissible for a\nfinancial holding company or financial\nsubsidiary without prior approval of the\nrelevant agency.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                   Form 10-K 7\nIn addition, a financial holding company\ngenerally may not engage in a new financial\nactivity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire\na company engaged in such a new activity, if\nany of its insured depository institutions\nreceives a CRA rating of less than\nSatisfactory. A national bank\u2019s financial\nsubsidiary generally may not engage in a new\nfinancial activity authorized by the GLB Act,\nor acquire a company engaged in such a new\nfinancial activity, if the national bank or\nany of its insured depository institution\naffiliates received a CRA rating of less than\nSatisfactory. At December 31, 2021, PNC Bank\nhad a rating of Outstanding with respect to\nCRA.\n\nVolcker Rule . The Volcker Rule and its\nimplementing regulations prohibit banking\nentities from engaging in short-term trading\nas principal and having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with hedge\nfunds, private equity funds, and certain other\nprivate funds (together, \u201ccovered funds\u201d),\nunless an exemption or exception applies. For\nexample, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule\nallow banking entities to trade as principal\nfor securities underwriting, market making and\nrisk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a\nvariety of conditions. As a result of rule\nchanges adopted in 2019, PNC and PNC Bank are\nsubject to simplified and tailored compliance\nprogram requirements because each entity has\ntrading assets and liabilities of less than\n$20 billion. To date, the prohibitions under\nthe final Volcker Rule regulations have not\nhad a material effect on our businesses or\nrevenue.\n\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and\nSupervision . The federal banking agencies\npossess broad powers to take corrective action\nas deemed appropriate based on the actions,\noperations or risk management programs of a\nBHC, an insured depository institution or\ntheir subsidiaries, and the Federal Reserve\nand the OCC have the ability to take\nenforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank,\nrespectively, to prevent and remedy acts and\npractices that the agencies determine to be\nunfair or deceptive. A finding that we have\nengaged in a deceptive act or practice may\nhave collateral consequences on our ability to\nrely on certain exemptions in, or take\nadvantage of certain provisions of, the\nsecurities laws absent a government waiver of\nsuch restrictions.\n\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination\nratings, lower capital or liquidity ratios\nthan peer group institutions, or regulatory\nconcerns regarding management, controls,\nassets, operations or other factors can all\npotentially result in practical limitations on\nthe ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new\nactivities, grow, acquire new businesses,\nrepurchase its stock or pay dividends or\ncontinue to conduct existing activities.\nFurthermore, the OCC has established certain\nheightened risk management and governance\nstandards for large banks, including PNC Bank.\nThe guidelines, among other things, establish\nminimum standards for the design and\nimplementation of a risk governance framework,\ndescribe the appropriate risk management roles\nand responsibilities of front line units,\nindependent risk management, internal audit,\nand the board of directors, and provide that a\ncovered bank should have a comprehensive\nwritten statement that articulates its risk\nappetite and serves as a basis for the\nframework. If the OCC determines that a\ncovered national bank is not in compliance\nwith these or other enforceable guidelines\n(including guidelines relating to information\nsecurity standards), the OCC may require the\nbank to submit a corrective action plan and\nmay initiate enforcement action against the\nbank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or\nthe bank fails to comply with an approved\nplan.\n\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve\nAct and the Federal Reserve\u2019s implementing\nregulation, Regulation W, place quantitative\nand qualitative restrictions on covered\ntransactions between a bank and its affiliates\n(for example between PNC Bank, on the one\nhand, and The PNC Financial Services Group,\nInc. and its non-bank subsidiaries, on the\nother hand). In general, Section 23A and\nRegulation W limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and any single\naffiliate to 10% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, limit the total amount of covered\ntransactions between a bank and all its\naffiliates to 20% of the bank\u2019s capital stock\nand surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing\nlow-quality assets from an affiliate and\nrequire certain covered transactions to be\nsecured with prescribed amounts of collateral.\nCovered transactions include, among other\nthings, extensions of credit, guarantees and\npurchases of assets. Section 23B generally\nrequires that transactions between a bank and\nits affiliates be on terms that are at least\nas favorable to the bank as the terms that\nwould apply in comparable transactions between\nthe bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended\nSection 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to\ninclude as a covered transaction the credit\nexposure of a bank to an affiliate arising\nfrom a derivative transaction with the\naffiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to\npropose rules to implement these revisions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve\nregulations also place quantitative\nlimitations and conditions on extensions of\ncredit by a bank to its executive officers,\ndirectors, or principal shareholders and their\nrelated interests (including any company\ncontrolled by such persons). Generally,\nextensions of credit by a bank to such\nindividuals, companies and related interests\nmust comply with certain individual and\naggregate lending limits, as well as\nprocedural and qualitative requirements. As a\nresult of the amount of PNC common stock held\nby its advised mutual funds and other\naccounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a\nprincipal shareholder of PNC Bank for purposes\nof these regulations. The federal banking\nagencies have issued an interagency statement\naddressing the application of these insider\nlending restrictions to the other portfolio\ncompanies owned or controlled by the advised\nfunds and accounts of a fund complex that\ncould be considered a principal shareholder of\na bank, which is effective through the sooner\nof January 1, 2023, or the effective date of a\nfinal Federal Reserve rule that addresses the\ntreatment of extensions of credit by a bank to\nfund complex-controlled portfolio companies\nthat are considered insiders of the bank. The\nstatement explains that the federal banking\nagencies will continue to exercise discretion\nto not take enforcement action against either\na fund complex that is a principal shareholder\nof a bank, or a bank for which a fund complex\nis a principal shareholder, with respect to\nextensions of credit by the bank to the\nrelated interests of such fund complex that\notherwise would violate the insider lending\nrestrictions, subject to certain conditions.\n\n8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided\nguidance regarding incentive and other\nelements of compensation provided to\nexecutives and other employees at banking\norganizations they regulate, both as general\nindustry-wide guidance and guidance specific\nto select larger companies, including PNC.\nThese guidelines are intended to ensure that\nthe incentive compensation practices of\ncovered banking organizations do not encourage\nexcessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC\nand two other regulatory agencies to adopt\nregulations governing incentive compensation\nprovided by regulated financial services\ncompanies to their executives and other\nemployees. These agencies jointly proposed\nregulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to\nimplement these requirements. Final\nregulations have not been adopted.\n\nThe trust, investment advisory and other\nfiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank\nalso are subject to the OCC\u2019s regulations\ngoverning the fiduciary activities of national\nbanks, as well as applicable state fiduciary\nlaws. The OCC\u2019s regulations, among other\nthings, set standards for the administration\nof fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern\npotential conflicts of interests and establish\nrecordkeeping requirements for fiduciary\naccounts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval is\nrequired whenever we propose to acquire all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of any bank,\nto acquire direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of any class of voting\nsecurities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or\nconsolidate with any other BHC. In reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC, the factors the Federal Reserve\nmust consider include (i) the competitive\neffects of the proposal in the relevant\ngeographic markets; (ii) the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; (iii) the effect of the\ntransaction on the financial stability of the\nU.S.; (iv) the organizations\u2019 compliance with\nanti-money laundering laws and regulations;\n(v) the convenience and needs of the\ncommunities to be served; and (vi) the records\nof performance under the CRA of the insured\ndepository institutions involved in the\ntransaction. On July 9, 2021, President Biden\nsigned an executive order that, among other\nthings, recommended that the U.S. Department\nof Justice and federal banking agencies update\nguidelines on banking mergers to provide more\nrobust scrutiny of mergers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s prior approval also is\nrequired, and similar factors are considered,\nfor a BHC to acquire direct or indirect\nownership or control of more than 5% of any\nclass of voting securities of a savings\nassociation or savings and loan holding\ncompany, or to merge or consolidate with a\nsavings and loan holding company. In cases\ninvolving interstate bank acquisitions, the\nFederal Reserve also must consider the\nconcentration of deposits nationwide and in\ncertain individual states. A BHC is generally\nprohibited from merging or consolidating with,\nor acquiring, another company or bank if upon\nconsummation the resulting company would\ncontrol 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or\na state, or if the resulting company\u2019s\nliabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate\nliabilities of the U.S. financial sector\n(including the U.S. liabilities of foreign\nfinancial companies). In extraordinary cases,\nthe FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal\nReserve, could order the break-up of financial\nfirms that are deemed to present a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\n\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to\nacquire another insured bank or savings\nassociation by merger or to acquire deposits\nor substantially all of the assets of such\ninstitutions. In deciding whether to approve\nsuch a transaction, the OCC is required to\nconsider factors similar to those that must be\nconsidered by the Federal Reserve in\nconnection with the acquisition of a bank or\nBHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is\nrequired to merge a non-bank entity into PNC\nBank.\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized rules\ngoverning when a BHC is presumed to \u201ccontrol\u201d\nanother company for purposes of the BHC Act,\nthereby causing the company to be considered a\nsubsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The\nrules establish a set of presumptions\nidentifying when a BHC would be deemed to\ncontrol another company, with the nature and\nscope of relationships a BHC may have with a\nnon-controlled company (e.g., director or\nofficer representatives, scope of business\nrelationships, etc.) declining as the BHC\u2019s\nvoting ownership percentage in the company\nincreases.\n\nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters . PNC Bank\nis insured by the FDIC and subject to deposit\npremium assessments. PNC Bank, as an insured\ndepository institution with over $50 billion\nin assets and controlled by a BHC with over\n$500 billion in assets, will be reclassified\nas a \"highly complex institution\" under the\nFDIC\u2019s methodology for determining premium\nassessments in the second quarter of 2022.\nRegulatory matters could increase the cost of\nFDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured\nbank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are\n\u201crisk based.\u201d Therefore, higher fee\npercentages would be charged to banks that\nhave lower capital ratios or higher risk\nprofiles. These risk profiles take into\naccount, among other things, weaknesses that\nare found by the primary federal banking\nregulator through its examination and\nsupervision of the bank and the bank\u2019s\nholdings of assets or liabilities classified\nas higher risk by the FDIC, including brokered\ndeposits. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or\na bank\u2019s primary federal banking regulator\ncould increase the costs to a bank and result\nin an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher\nthan that of competing banks in a lower risk\ncategory.\n\nPNC Bank is subject to certain enhanced\ndeposit insurance recordkeeping requirements\nadopted by the FDIC, which are designed to\nassist the FDIC to promptly determine whether,\nor to what extent, a large bank\u2019s deposits are\ncovered by deposit insurance if the bank were\nto fail.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                   Form 10-K 9\nFederal banking laws and regulations also\napply a variety of requirements or\nrestrictions on insured depository\ninstitutions with respect to brokered\ndeposits. For instance, only a \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d insured depository institution\nmay accept brokered deposits without prior\nregulatory approval. In addition, brokered\ndeposits are generally subject to higher\noutflow assumptions than other types of\ndeposits for purposes of the LCR. The FDIC has\nissued rules and guidance for determining\nwhether deposits are considered \u201cbrokered.\u201d\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning. BHCs that\nhave $100 billion or more in assets, such as\nPNC, are required to periodically submit to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution\nplan (including a public summary) that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the company could be resolved in a rapid\nand orderly fashion if the company were to\nfail or experience material financial\ndistress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may\njointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC,\nincluding additional capital requirements or\nlimitations on growth, if the agencies jointly\ndetermine that the company\u2019s plan is not\ncredible or would not facilitate a rapid and\norderly resolution of the company under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable\nresolution framework), and additionally could\nrequire the company to divest assets or take\nother actions if the company did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed. PNC\ngenerally must file a resolution plan with the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC at least once each\nthree-year period, with submissions\nalternating between a full plan and a plan\ntargeted on certain areas or subjects\nidentified by the agencies. The agencies,\nhowever, have reserved the ability to alter\nthe scheduled filing date for a covered\ncompany, request an interim update before a\ncovered company\u2019s next scheduled filing date\nand require a covered company to submit a full\nresolution plan in lieu of a scheduled\ntargeted plan. PNC filed a targeted resolution\nplan in December 2021.\n\nThe FDIC also requires large insured\ndepository institutions, including PNC Bank,\nto periodically submit a resolution plan\n(including a public summary) to the FDIC that\nincludes, among other things, an analysis of\nhow the institution could be resolved under\nthe FDI Act in a manner that protects\ndepositors and limits losses or costs to\ncreditors of the bank in accordance with the\nFDI Act. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the\nmoratorium that it had instituted on\nresolution plan filings by insured depository\ninstitutions. PNC Bank\u2019s next resolution plan\nis due in December 2022.\n\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines\nthat establish standards for recovery\nplanning. These guidelines require a covered\nbank to develop and maintain a recovery plan\nthat is evaluated and updated annually that,\namong other things, identifies a range of\noptions that could be undertaken by the\ncovered bank to restore its financial strength\nand viability should identified triggering\nevents occur. The recovery plan guidelines are\nenforceable in the same manner as the other\nguidelines the OCC has established.\n\nCFPB Regulation and Supervision . The CFPB\nexamines PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with\na broad range of federal consumer financial\nlaws and regulations, including the laws and\nregulations that relate to deposit products,\ncredit card, mortgage, automobile, student and\nother consumer loans, and other consumer\nfinancial products and services that we offer.\nThe consumer financial protection laws that\nare subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervision and\nenforcement powers include, among others, the\nTruth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act,\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. The CFPB\nalso has authority to take enforcement actions\nto prevent and remedy acts and practices\nrelating to consumer financial products and\nservices that it deems to be unfair, deceptive\nor abusive, and to impose new disclosure\nrequirements for any consumer financial\nproduct or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by PNC or PNC\nBank. The regulations could reduce the fees\nthat we receive, require that we provide\nadditional consumer disclosures, alter the way\nwe provide our products and services, impair\nour ability to compete with other providers of\nfinancial products or services, or expose us\nto greater risk of private litigation or\nregulatory enforcement action. The CFPB has\nengaged in rulemakings that affect, among\nother things, consumer remittance transfers,\nthe qualified mortgage definition under the\nTruth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act, and payday, vehicle title, and\ncertain high-cost installment loans and may\nestablish, or modify, rules governing other\naspects of consumer financial products or\nservices in the future.\n                                              \n  Securities and Derivatives Regulation       \n                                              \nOur registered broker-dealer and investment\nadviser subsidiaries are subject to the\nExchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act\nof 1940, respectively, and related rules and\nregulations promulgated by the SEC. These\nrules, for example, require that broker-\ndealers and investment advisers act in a\ncustomer\u2019s best interest when making\ninvestment recommendations to retail\ncustomers, which includes managing conflicts\nof interest, providing required disclosures\nand exercising a duty of care in making\ninvestment recommendations. FINRA is the\nprimary self-regulatory organization for our\nregistered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our\nbroker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries also are subject to additional\nregulation by states or local jurisdictions.\n\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement\nfunctions that oversee broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers and can bring actions that\nresult in fines, restitution, a limitation on\npermitted activities, disqualification to\ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an\ninability to rely on certain favorable\nexemptions. Certain types of infractions and\nviolations also can affect our ability to\nexpeditiously issue new securities into the\ncapital markets. In addition, certain changes\nin the activities of a broker-dealer require\napproval from FINRA,\n\n10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nand FINRA takes into account a variety of\nconsiderations in acting upon applications for\nsuch approval, including internal controls,\ncapital levels, management experience and\nquality, prior enforcement and disciplinary\nhistory and supervisory concerns.\n\nThe CFTC regulates swap dealers, other than\nsecurity-based swap dealers, which are\nregulated by the SEC. PNC Bank is\nprovisionally registered as a swap dealer with\nthe CFTC. Because of the limited volume of our\nsecurity-based swap dealing activities, PNC\nBank has not registered (and currently does\nnot intend to register) with the SEC as a\nsecurity-based swap dealer.\n\nPNC Bank\u2019s derivatives and foreign exchange\nbusinesses are subject to the regulations and\nrequirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap\ndealers, and the CFTC (and for certain\ndelegated responsibilities, the National\nFutures Association) has a meaningful\nsupervisory role with respect to PNC Bank\u2019s\nderivatives and foreign exchange businesses.\nThe CFTC\u2019s regulations are intended to (i)\naddress systemic risk issues, (ii) bring\ngreater transparency to the derivatives and\nforeign exchange markets, (iii) provide\nenhanced disclosures and protections to\ncustomers and (iv) promote market integrity.\nAmong other things, these regulations (i)\nrequire that, absent certain specified\nexemptions, most standardized swaps be\ncentrally cleared through a regulated clearing\nhouse and be traded on a centralized exchange\nor swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC\nBank to capital requirements in excess of\nhistorical practice; (iii) subject PNC Bank to\ncomprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory\nreporting and real-time public reporting\nrequirements; (iv) subject PNC Bank to various\nbusiness conduct requirements, including the\nprovision of daily marks to counterparties and\ndisclosing to counterparties (pre-execution)\nthe material risks, material incentives and\nany conflicts of interest associated with\ntheir swap; (v) impose special duties on PNC\nBank when transacting a swap with a \u201cspecial\nentity\u201d (e.g., governmental agency (federal,\nstate or local) or political subdivision\nthereof, pension plan or endowment); and (vi)\nimpose margin requirements on certain swaps\nthat are not centrally cleared through a\nregulated clearing house.\n\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to\nPNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC\nswap dealer, have imposed and will continue to\nimpose compliance burdens on PNC Bank and\nintroduce additional legal risks (including as\na result of applicable anti-fraud and anti-\nmanipulation provisions and private rights of\naction). In addition, failure to comply with\nthe \u201cpay-to-play\u201d regulations that govern our\nswap and municipal securities businesses could\nresult in limitations on PNC Bank\u2019s ability to\nconduct swap and municipal securities business\nwith state or local governments and their\nauthorities.\n                                              \n  Regulations of Other Agencies               \n                                              \nIn addition to regulations issued by the\nfederal banking, securities and derivatives\nregulators, we also are subject to regulations\nissued by other federal agencies with respect\nto certain financial products and services we\noffer. For example, certain of our fiduciary,\nbrokerage and investment management activities\nare subject to regulations issued by the\nDepartment of Labor under ERISA and related\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code and\ncertain of our student lending and servicing\nactivities are subject to regulation by the\nDepartment of Education.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nWe are subject to intense competition from\nother regulated banking organizations, as well\nas various other types of financial\ninstitutions and non-bank entities that can\noffer a number of similar products and\nservices without being subject to bank\nregulatory supervision and restrictions.\n\nOur businesses compete for deposits and/or\nloans with:\n\n\u2022 Other commercial banks,\n\n\u2022 Savings banks,\n\n\u2022 Credit unions,\n\n\u2022 Consumer finance companies,\n\n\u2022 Leasing companies,\n\n\u2022 Other non-bank lenders,\n\n\u2022 Financial technology companies,\n\n\u2022 Treasury management service companies,\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies,\n\n\u2022 Issuers of commercial paper and other\nsecurities, including mutual funds, and\n\n\u2022 Other international money transfer\nbusinesses.\n\nIn providing asset management services, our\nbusinesses compete with:\n\n\u2022 Investment management firms,\n\n\u2022 Large banks and other financial\ninstitutions,\n\n\u2022 Brokerage firms,\n\n\u2022 Financial technology companies,\n\n\u2022 Mutual fund complexes, and\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 11\nOur various non-bank businesses engaged in\ninvestment banking and alternative investment\nactivities compete with:\n\n\u2022 Commercial banks,\n\n\u2022 Investment banking firms,\n\n\u2022 Collateralized loan obligation managers,\n\n\u2022 Hedge funds,\n\n\u2022 Mutual fund complexes,\n\n\u2022 Merchant banks,\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies,\n\n\u2022 Private equity firms, and\n\n\u2022 Other investment vehicles.\n\nCompetition is based on a number of factors\nincluding pricing, product structure, the\nrange of products and services offered and the\nquality of customer service. Loan pricing,\nstructure and credit standards are extremely\nimportant as we seek to achieve appropriate\nrisk-adjusted returns. Deposit-taking\nactivities are also subject to pricing\npressures and to customer migration as a\nresult of intense competition for deposits and\ninvestments. Competitors may seek to compete\nwith us through traditional channels such as\nphysical locations or through digital channels\nsuch as the internet or mobile applications.\nWe include here by reference the additional\ninformation regarding competition and factors\naffecting our competitive position included in\nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\n                                              \n  Human Capital                               \n                                              \nWe place great importance on having the right\npeople, in the right roles, with the right\nskills, and doing their best work. By focusing\non the growth and development of our talented\nteam members, we believe we are best\npositioned to deliver results for our\ncustomers. We believe when our employees\ndeliver for our customers, they deliver for\nour communities and shareholders as well.\n\nPNC devotes substantial resources to managing\nits human capital. Our Board of Directors\nprovides oversight of our human capital\nmanagement strategies, programs and policies\ndeveloped by our senior management team and is\nassisted by our Board's Nominating and\nGovernance and Human Resources Committees. Our\nManagement Level Executive Committee assists\nand makes recommendations to our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Board of Directors on\nhuman capital matters.\n\nThe Board of Directors also includes a Special\nCommittee on Equity & Inclusion, which assists\nthe Board in its oversight of management\u2019s\nequity and inclusion efforts. Additionally,\nunder the leadership of the Chief Corporate\nResponsibility Officer, PNC operates a\ncorporate responsibility department. The Chief\nCorporate Responsibility Officer is a member\nof the Executive Committee, reporting directly\nto the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of\nDirectors provides formal oversight of the\ncompany\u2019s corporate responsibility strategy\nand regularly reviews policies, programs and\nstrategies foundational to the work of the\ncorporate responsibility department.\n\nEmployees totaled 59,426 at December 31, 2021.\nThis total included 57,668 full-time and 1,758\npart-time employees, of which 32,563 full-time\nand 1,669 part-time employees were employed in\nour Retail Banking business.\n\nPart of PNC\u2019s ability to compete effectively\ndepends on our ability to attract new\nemployees and retain and develop our existing\nemployees. In support of our employees, our\nstrategic human capital goals include:\n\n\u2022 Advancing PNC\u2019s talent-focused culture by\ndeveloping strong leaders who exemplify our\nLeadership Standards, a set of standards\ndesigned to hold managers accountable for\nintentional inclusion, living our corporate\nvalues, enabling change, achieving results and\ndeveloping the best talent and providing them\nwith the tools and insights to effectively\nmanage our people.\n\n\u2022 Focusing on the development and retention of\ndiverse, high performing talent and providing\nemployees with opportunities for professional\ngrowth, career mobility and health and\nfinancial wellness.\n\n\u2022 Supporting a strong, ethical culture\nanchored in our corporate values and doing the\nright thing for our employees, customers,\ncommunities and shareholders.\n\n\u2022 Continuing to focus on improving workforce\ndiversity and creating an equitable and\ninclusive work place.\n\nIn managing our employees, we focus on these\nkey factors:\n\n\u2022 Recruiting, developing and retaining talent\n. We believe recruiting, developing and\nretaining talent starts with our leaders, and\nwe measure our managers against our Leadership\nStandards. Our talent priority is to invest in\nthe development of our internal talent and to\nprovide career advancement opportunities to\nour employees. We measure how many open\nrequisitions we fill with internal candidates,\nparticipation in early career development\nprograms and turnover. At our first-level and\nabove career bands we fill approximately 63%\nof our open requisitions with internal\ncandidates, which has a direct impact on our\nability to retain and develop our people. In\naddition, we hire approximately 500 interns\nand 500 full-time development program\nassociates each year from our 11 early career\ndevelopment programs that support each of our\nlines of business and support areas. In regard\nto recruiting and retaining talent amid an\never-changing landscape, we have set an\nobjective of making long-\n\n12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nterm flexibility a differentiator for PNC. Our\nflexible workforce model includes personnel in\nfully remote, fully on-site and hybrid (mix of\nremote/on-site) positions based on role and\njob responsibilities. Our approach to\nflexibility will evolve as we learn and\nevaluate what works best for our employees and\nPNC.\n\n\u2022 Diversity, equity and inclusion . We focus\non attracting, developing and retaining a\ndiverse workforce that reflects and is\nequipped to meet the needs of our diverse\ncustomer base. Based on employee self-\ndisclosure, we measure representation of\nLGBTQ+, people with disabilities, veterans and\nwomen, and across all races and certain\nethnicities. As of December 31, 2021,\napproximately 59% of PNC\u2019s workforce and 50%\nof PNC\u2019s employees in managerial roles were\nwomen. People of color represented\napproximately 34% of PNC\u2019s workforce,\nincluding 26% of our employees in managerial\nroles, as of December 31, 2021. As part of\nbuilding a pipeline of diverse talent, 77% of\nthe early career development program\nparticipants in 2021 were diverse, including\nLGBTQ+, women, veterans, people of color and\nthose with a disability.\n\n\u2022 Total rewards . We are committed to\nproviding competitive compensation and\nbenefits programs as part of our overall\nstrategy to retain and recruit diverse talent.\nWe design our compensation and benefits\nprograms to focus on three key aspects of\nemployee well-being: health, money and quality\nof life. These programs include competitive\nbase salaries and, depending on eligibility,\ncash incentive and/or stock-based award\nopportunities, an Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan, a 401(k) Plan with employer match, a\npension plan, healthcare, life insurance and\ndisability benefits, health savings and\ndependent care flexible spending accounts,\npaid time off, paid maternity and parental\nleave, family care resources, flexible work\nschedules, a robust wellness program with\nincentives, adoption assistance, employee\nassistance programs and educational\nassistance, among others. Additionally, we\nconduct pay equity analyses to determine if\nemployees are being compensated fairly and\nconsistently across roles.\n\n\u2022 Employee engagement . Twice a year, PNC\nconducts employee surveys to measure employee\nengagement because we believe that engaged\nemployees have lower attrition rates and\nimproved customer outcomes.\n\nPNC continues to recognize the impacts that\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has had and will likely\ncontinue to have on our human capital. We are\nmonitoring the status of the pandemic\nnationally and locally and continue to\nprioritize the safety and well-being of our\nemployees, while complying with all state and\nlocal health mandates and managing in\naccordance with Center for Disease Control\nguidelines. Our various strategies and\npolicies in place to promote the health and\nsafety of our employees who need to be on-site\nto execute their job responsibilities continue\nto evolve.\n                                              \n  Climate Change Strategy                     \n                                              \nWe recognize that environmental issues, such\nas climate change, could pose significant\nfinancial, legal and reputational risk to PNC.\nPNC\u2019s sustainability and climate change\nstrategy is based on a four-pronged approach:\n(i) maintaining risk management controls that\nincorporate climate change considerations,\n(ii) managing our internal operations in a\nsustainable manner, (iii) helping our clients\nfinance their sustainable operations and (iv)\nmanaging capital for our clients in\nresponsible ways. We adapt this approach based\non best practices as we learn what works for\nPNC and our stakeholders.\n\nOur governance of climate issues seeks to\nensure an appropriate balancing of financial\npriorities and environmental considerations as\nwe pursue our purpose of helping all of our\nstakeholders move forward financially. PNC\u2019s\nBoard oversees climate change-related efforts.\nSpecific internal working groups, engaging\nwith relevant stakeholders within PNC, then\ncarry out these efforts. In addition, we have\nestablished a risk management framework to\nidentify, assess, monitor and report on\nenvironmental and social risks, including\nthose related to climate change. PNC has also\ndeveloped a carbon intensity score, which is a\ntop-down assessment of the carbon intensity of\nour loan portfolio. Aligning with qualitative\nassessments of carbon intensities within\nindustries, the carbon intensity scores are\nprimarily used as a high-level benchmarking\nand portfolio trend tool.\n\nWe assess climate change risks under two\ndistinct categories: transition risks and\nphysical risks. Transition risks are\nexperienced as the world moves toward a low-\ncarbon economy and becomes less reliant upon\nfossil fuels. They can be reputational in\nnature or driven by changes in the market,\ntechnology and/or policy. Because transition\nrisks are typically experienced to a greater\ndegree in the short- to medium-term, they are\ndependent upon near-term policy decisions.\nPhysical risks exist due to the increased\nseverity of natural hazards stemming from a\nchanging climate and we believe are realized\nto a greater degree in the medium-to-long-\nterm. Transition and physical risks each\nrequires a different risk management approach,\nand we explore a range of possible outcomes to\ngain insight on how to best manage these\nrisks.\n\nFor more information on PNC\u2019s climate change-\nrelated risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors and\nthe Credit Risk Management Section of Item 7\nof this Report.\n                                              \n  SEC Reports and Corporate Governance        \n  Information                                 \n                                              \nWe are subject to the informational\nrequirements of the Exchange Act and, in\naccordance with the Exchange Act, we file\nannual, quarterly and current reports, proxy\nstatements, and other information with the\nSEC.

As a financial services company,\ncertain elements of risk are inherent in what\nwe do and the business decisions we make.\nThus, we encounter risk as part of the normal\ncourse of our business, and we design risk\nmanagement processes to help manage these\nrisks.\n\nOur success is dependent on our ability to\nidentify, understand and manage the risks\npresented by our business activities so that\nwe can appropriately balance risk taking with\nrevenue generation and profitability. We\ndiscuss our principal risk management\noversight and processes and, in appropriate\nplaces, related historical performance and\nother metrics in the Risk Management section\nincluded in Item 7 of this Report.\n\nThe following are the material risk factors\nthat affect us of which we are currently\naware.

We could also suffer a material\nadverse impact from interruptions in the\neffective operation of our information systems\nand other technology, including as a result of\nthird party breaches of data security either\nat PNC or at third parties handling PNC\ninformation.\n\n\u2022 Our business and financial results are\nsubject to risks associated with the\ncreditworthiness of our customers and\ncounterparties, the concentration and mix of\nour loan portfolio, market interest rates and\nmovements in those rates and changes in the\nvalues of financial assets.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to risks related to the\nselection of accounting methods, inaccurate\nestimates and assumptions and to risks related\nto poorly designed and implemented models that\nare extensively used in our business.\n\n\u2022 We operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment and our success depends on our\nability to attract and retain customers and\ntalented employees and we are at risk for an\nadverse impact on our business due to damage\nto our reputation.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to operational risks as a\nresult of our dependence on the effectiveness\nand integrity of our employees and on third\nparty vendors, service providers and other\ncounterparties over whom we do not have direct\ncontrol.\n\n\u2022 We are subject to risks related to growing\nour business by acquiring other financial\nservices business from time to time as these\nacquisitions, including the acquisition of\nBBVA, present a number of risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransactions themselves and to the integration\nof the acquired businesses into PNC after\nclosing.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic      \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to\ncontinue to have an adverse effect, possibly\nmaterially, on our overall business and\nfinancial performance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in\nwidespread and continuing impacts on economic\nand financial conditions, our customers and\nour employees. While economic conditions have\nimproved since the first half of 2020, the\nrecovery has been inconsistent across\ndifferent geographic regions, sectors,\ncompanies and individuals and subject to\nsetbacks as conditions related to the pandemic\nfluctuate. There is still a great deal of\nuncertainty about the length and severity of\nthe pandemic and the strength or reversal of\nthe economic rebound. While many of the\nimpacts have subsided, including as a result\nof relaxation of responsive measures to manage\nthe pandemic, future developments may lead to\nreimposed or new responsive measures that\notherwise increase the negative economic\nimpacts of the pandemic. Accordingly, the\npandemic and its consequences had and are\nlikely to continue to have an adverse effect,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 15\npossibly materially, on our overall business\nand financial performance. The following are\nexamples of the most likely impacts on PNC:\n\n\u2022 National macroeconomic indicators, forecasts\nand performance expectations have all steadily\nimproved, which has had a beneficial impact on\nour credit risk, but uncertainty remains\nregarding lifetime losses of certain portions\nof our commercial and consumer portfolios. For\ncommercial borrowers, there are still\nlingering concerns around industries that have\nbeen affected by COVID-19 related restrictions\nand market changes. For these industries,\nwhere unrestricted commerce has recently\nreturned, the recovery will lag the broader\neconomy. Where restrictions persist or market\nchanges have emerged, the impact and eventual\nlevel of recovery are less certain. For\nconsumer borrowers, payment behavior upon\nexpiration of government stimulus, including\nrecently expired enhanced unemployment\nbenefits, is still difficult to predict. As a\nresult, there is a likelihood that certain of\nour commercial and consumer customers or\ncounterparties will become delinquent on their\nloans or other obligations to us, which, in\nturn, will result in a higher level of non-\nperforming loans and net charge-offs. In\naddition, given the uncertainty about the\nlength and severity of the pandemic and the\nstrength or reversal of the economic rebound,\nour provision for credit losses may be more\nvolatile period-to-period with a corresponding\nincrease in period-to-period volatility in our\nnet income.\n\n\u2022 There has been and there is likely to\ncontinue to be a decrease in the demand for\ncertain of our products and services which\ncould be further exacerbated if customers lose\nconfidence due to concerns regarding the\neconomy, including as a result of inflationary\npressures or supply chain disruptions.\n\n\u2022 While customer deposits have grown, aiding\nour liquidity, future changes in behavior\nresulting in declining deposit balances would\nlikely increase our funding costs and reduce\nour net interest income and liquidity\nresources.\n\n\u2022 Some of the legislation responsive to the\noutbreak, including the CARES Act and the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, provides for\ncertain commercial and consumer protections\nwhich have altered and may continue to alter\nthe profitability of the transactions in which\nwe engage. These laws may be extended or\nincreased in scope, and other laws may be\nenacted in response to the pandemic that have\nsimilar or broader effects on us.\n\n\u2022 Other laws related to employee benefits and\nthe treatment of employees have negatively\nimpacted and may continue to negatively impact\nus by increasing administrative, compensation\nand benefits costs by, for example, mandating\ncoverage of certain COVID-19 related testing\nwithout cost sharing or mandating additional\npaid or unpaid leave. Further governmental\naction that is taken to mitigate the economic\neffects of the pandemic, as well as additional\ncompensation or benefit actions taken by PNC,\ncould adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations, possibly\nmaterially, in other ways that are not known\nnow.\n\n\u2022 We rely on our employees, third party\nvendors and service providers and other\ncounterparties, both domestically and abroad,\nto support many aspects of our business.\nReduced workforces which may be caused by,\namong other things, illness, quarantine, stay\nat home or other government mandates,\ndecisions regarding mandatory vaccination,\nproof of vaccination or face covering\nrequirements, difficulties transitioning back\nto an in-office environment or substantial\nchanges in the labor market (including labor\navailability and wage inflation) could result\nin an adverse impact to our operations and\nfinancial performance. These risks are also\nfaced by many of our customers which could\nadversely affect their operations and\nfinancial performance and increase our credit\nrisk or decrease the demand for our products\nand services. Many of these risks are likely\nto persist after the pandemic as a result of\npermanent changes to the labor market.\n\n\u2022 In support of our employees, customers and\ncommunities, we have taken and may continue to\ntake steps beyond or in addition to those\nrequired by governmental or regulatory\nminimums which may further adversely impact\nour profitability. For example, we have\nprovided and may continue to provide\nadditional relief or forbearance to customers,\nhealth and wellness benefits to employees\n(including significant company approved leave)\nor financial support for community initiatives\nto assist those in need because of the\noutbreak. The actual or perceived failure to\nprovide sufficient services, support or relief\nto those businesses or individuals in need or\nproperly implement legislation responsive to\nthe outbreak or our voluntary commitments\ncould negatively impact our reputation with\nadverse consequences to our business. In\naddition, such actual or perceived failure, or\noperational and other issues that arise in\nconnection with the implementation of\ngovernment-mandated or other financial\nassistance or relief programs present elevated\nlevels of financial, legal and reputational\nrisk, including fraud, governmental and\nregulatory inquiries, investigations and\nenforcement actions, as well as private\nlawsuits. Participation by PNC in governmental\nprograms, such as the CARES Act and the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, including the\nPPP, also have exposed and may continue to\nexpose us to governmental investigation and\naction or public scrutiny and criticism.\n\nRefer to our other Risk Factors in this Item\n1A for information regarding other factors\nthat have and are likely to continue to affect\nour business and financial performance as a\nresult of the pandemic.\n\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other\nExternal Factors, Including Regulation\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of adverse economic\nconditions.\n\nAs a financial services company, our business\nand overall financial performance are affected\nto a significant extent by economic\nconditions, primarily in the U.S.\n\nDeclining or adverse economic conditions and\nadverse changes in investor, consumer and\nbusiness sentiment generally result in reduced\nbusiness activity, which may decrease the\ndemand for our products and services or reduce\nthe number of creditworthy borrowers. The\nability of borrowers to repay loans is often\nweakened as a result of economic downturns and\nhigher inflation and unemployment. In\naddition, periods of inflation may affect\ncertain of our costs or expenses (including\nincreasing our cost of capital and labor),\nerode consumer and customer purchasing power,\nconfidence and spending and may also reduce\nour tolerance for extending credit. Increases\nin costs or expenses impacting our customers\u2019\noperations and financial performance, such as\nthe interest rate payable on their debt\nobligations, could increase our credit risk or\ndecrease the demand for our products and\nservices. Recently, there has been\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\ninflation at higher levels than seen in many\ndecades, and significant supply chain\nconstraints have increased costs and impacted\noperations for us and many of our customers.\nThese conditions may not abate in the near\nterm and their continuation could materially\nadversely affect our operations and financial\nperformance. Such economic conditions also may\nlead to turmoil and volatility in financial\nmarkets, often with at least some financial\nasset categories losing value. Any of these\neffects would likely have an adverse impact on\nour earnings, with the significance of the\nimpact generally depending on the nature and\nseverity of the adverse economic conditions.\n\nEven when economic conditions are relatively\ngood or stable, specific economic factors can\nnegatively affect our business and\nperformance. This can be especially true when\nthe factors relate to particular segments of\nthe economy. For example, shifting consumer\nbehavior with respect to retail purchases\nbeing made over the internet rather than in\nphysical stores has negatively impacted\nperformance by some retailers. This likely\ndecreases demand for financial services in\nthat sector, possibly harming the\ncreditworthiness of some shopping mall\noperators, retail companies and others with\nwhom we do business. As another example,\ndeclines in leisure recreation and travel\nbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic have\nadversely affected and may continue to\nadversely affect restaurants, casinos, hotels,\nconvention centers, cruise lines, airlines and\nother travel/transportation companies. In\naddition, remote work has adversely affected\nand may continue to adversely affect\ncommercial real estate, as well as businesses\nwhose customers have historically been office\nworkers. Affected companies have experienced\nand may continue to experience lower levels of\nbusiness and possible declining\ncreditworthiness.\n\nGiven the geographic scope of our business and\noperations, we are most exposed to issues\nwithin the U.S. economy and financial markets.\nOur foreign business activities continue to be\na relatively small part of our overall\nbusiness. As a result, the direct impact on\nour business and performance from economic\nconditions outside the U.S. is not likely to\nbe significant, although the impact would\nincrease if we expand our foreign business\nmore than nominally. We are, however,\nsusceptible to the risk that such economic\nconditions could negatively affect our\nbusiness and financial performance. Primarily,\nthis risk results from the possibility that\npoor economic conditions or financial market\ndisruptions affecting other major economies\nwould also affect the U.S.\n\nThroughout the remainder of this Risk Factors\nsection, we address specific ways in which\neconomic issues could create risk for us and\nresult in adverse impacts on our business and\nfinancial performance. In particular, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has led to economic issues\nof the types described here and presents the\nrisk of further such impacts. See the\nimmediately preceding Risk Factor for a\ndiscussion of risks associated with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe impact of government legislation,\nregulation and policy and other political\nfactors on the economy could have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial\nperformance.\n\nChanges in law or governmental policy\naffecting the economy, business activity, or\npersonal spending, investing or saving\nactivities may cause consumers and businesses\nto alter behavior in ways that impact demand\nfor our products and services. Such changes\nmay also alter the profitability of the\ntransactions in which we engage or result in\nincreased regulatory burden and associated\ncosts. PNC may alter the types or terms of the\nproducts and services we offer to reflect such\nchanges. Uncertainty regarding future law or\npolicy may have similar impacts. Changes in\nthe U.S. presidential administration and\nCongress have led and will likely continue to\nlead to changes in law or policy, including\nthe level of regulation and supervision of\nfinancial institutions. For example, it is\npossible that Congress amends or repeals all\nor certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 which could adversely affect us,\nincluding through a complete or partial repeal\nof the reduction in the statutory corporate\nincome tax rate. In addition, changes in key\npersonnel at the agencies that regulate us,\nincluding the federal banking regulators, may\nresult in differing interpretations of\nexisting rules and guidelines and potentially\nmore stringent enforcement and severe\npenalties. Moreover, a change in regulatory\npractices that increases the time frames to\nobtain regulatory approvals for acquisitions\nand other activities or makes them more\ndifficult to obtain could affect our ability\nto make acquisitions or introduce new products\nand services.\n\nConcern regarding the ability of Congress and\nthe President collectively to reach agreement\non federal budgetary matters (including the\ndebt ceiling), or prolonged stalemates leading\nto total or partial governmental shutdowns,\nalso can have adverse economic consequences\nand create the risk of economic instability or\nmarket volatility, with potential adverse\nconsequences to our business and financial\nperformance.\n\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other\ngovernmental agencies have a significant\nimpact on interest rates and overall financial\nmarket performance, which are important to our\nbusiness and financial performance.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve\nhave a significant impact on interest rates,\nthe value of financial instruments and other\nassets and liabilities, and overall financial\nmarket performance. These policies can thus\naffect the activities and results of\noperations of financial companies such as PNC.\nAn important function of the Federal Reserve\nis to monitor the national supply of bank\ncredit and set certain interest rates. The\nactions of the Federal Reserve influence the\nrates of interest that we charge on loans and\nthat we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing\ndeposits. Rates of interest can also affect\nthe value of our on-balance sheet and off-\nbalance sheet financial instruments. Although\nwe may not accurately predict the nature or\ntiming of future changes in monetary policies\nor the precise effects that they may have on\nour activities and financial results, we\nanticipate that the FOMC will raise the\nfederal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points\nfive times in 2022 to reach a range of 1.25%\nto 1.50% by the end of the year, and then\nfurther increase the federal funds rate in\n2023.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 17\nIn addition, monetary policy actions by\ngovernmental authorities in the European Union\nor other countries could have an impact on\nglobal interest rates, which could affect\nrates in the U.S. as well as rates on\ninstruments denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar, any of which could have\none or more of the potential effects on us\ndescribed above.\n\nSome of the potential impacts on our business\nand results of governmental monetary policy\nare described in Risk Factors under the\nheading \u201cRisks Related to the Business of\nBanking.\u201d The Federal Reserve has lowered its\nbenchmark rates to historically low levels as\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the\nRisk Factor headed \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has\nhad and is likely to continue to have an\nadverse effect, possibly materially, on our\noverall business and financial performance.\u201d\n\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are\nsubject to numerous governmental regulations\nand comprehensive oversight by a variety of\nregulatory agencies and enforcement\nauthorities. These regulations and the way\nthey are implemented can have a significant\nimpact on our businesses and operations and\nour ability to grow and expand.\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a\nBHC and a financial holding company, with the\nFederal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC\nBank is a federally chartered bank, with the\nOCC as its primary regulator. In addition, our\nbusinesses are subject to regulation by\nmultiple other banking, consumer protection,\nsecurities and derivatives regulatory bodies.\nWe are also subject to the jurisdiction of\ncriminal and civil enforcement authorities.\n\nAs a result, we are subject to numerous laws\nand regulations involving both our business\nand organization, with multiple regulators or\nagencies having supervisory or enforcement\noversight over aspects of our business. These\nlaws, regulations and supervisory activities\nare intended to promote the safety and\nsoundness of financial institutions, financial\nmarket stability, the transparency and\nliquidity of financial markets, and consumer\nand investor protection and prevent money\nlaundering and terrorist financing and are not\nprimarily intended to protect PNC security\nholders. In addition to regulation in the\nU.S., we are also subject to foreign\nregulation to a limited extent as a result of\nour business activities outside the U.S.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our\npermissible activities and investments and\nrequire compliance with provisions designed to\nprotect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary,\nand other customers, and for the protection of\ncustomer information, among other things. We\nalso are subject to laws and regulations\ndesigned to combat money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and transactions with persons,\ncompanies or foreign governments designated by\nU.S. authorities. Over time, the scope of the\nlaws and regulations affecting our businesses,\nas well as the number of requirements or\nlimitations imposed by legislative or\nregulatory actions, has increased, and we\nexpect to continue to face substantial\nregulatory oversight and new or revised\nregulatory requirements or initiatives.\nLegislative or regulatory actions can result\nin increased compliance costs, reduced\nbusiness opportunities, or new requirements\nand limitations on how we conduct our\nbusiness. In particular, the financial\nservices industry continues to face heightened\nscrutiny, particularly with respect to BSA and\nAML compliance requirements and consumer\ncompliance and protection matters.\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a\nsource of financial and managerial strength\nfor its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve\ncould require PNC to commit resources to PNC\nBank when doing so is not otherwise in the\ninterests of PNC or its shareholders or\ncreditors.\n\nFederal law grants substantial supervisory and\nenforcement powers to federal banking\nregulators. The results of routine and non-\nroutine supervisory or examination activities\nby our regulators, including actual or\nperceived compliance failures, could result in\nlimitations on our ability to enter into\ncertain transactions, engage in new\nactivities, expand geographically, make\nacquisitions or obtain necessary regulatory\napprovals in connection therewith. These\nactivities also could result in significant\nfines, penalties or required corrective\nactions, some of which could be expensive and\ndifficult to implement. In addition, another\nfinancial institution\u2019s violation of law or\nregulation may give rise to an investigation\nof the same or similar activities of PNC.\n\nAs we expand our product and service offerings\ninto additional markets, domestic or foreign,\neither through organic growth or acquisition,\nwe have faced and will continue to face\nincreases in state or foreign regulation\naffecting our operations. Different approaches\nto regulation by different jurisdictions could\nmaterially increase our compliance costs or\nrisks of non-compliance .\n\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate\npolicies and procedures designed to comply,\nwith regulatory requirements and expectations\nexposes us to the risk of damages, fines and\nregulatory penalties and other regulatory or\nenforcement actions or consequences, such as\nlimitations on activities otherwise\npermissible for us or additional requirements\nfor engaging in new activities and could also\ninjure our reputation with customers and\nothers with whom we do business. We also rely\non third parties who may expose us to\ncompliance risk. A failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements or deficiencies in\nrisk management practices could be\nincorporated in our confidential supervisory\nratings which could limit PNC\u2019s ability to\nexpand or require additional approvals before\nengaging in certain business activities.\n\nSee the immediately following Risk Factor for\na discussion of risks associated with capital\nand liquidity regulation. Also see Supervision\nand Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for\nmore information concerning the regulation of\nPNC, including those areas that have been\nreceiving a high level of regulatory focus.\nNote 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report also discusses some of the\nregulation applicable to us.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect our business,\noperations and ability to pay dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders.\n\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements established\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nrespectively. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the Basel\nCommittee and then applied, with adjustments,\nin each country by the appropriate domestic\nregulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory\nagencies can apply stricter capital and\nliquidity standards than those developed by\nthe Basel Committee. In several instances, the\nU.S. banking agencies have done so with\nrespect to U.S. banking organizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity, and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of our capital\nand liquidity, impact our business activities\nand may prevent us from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force us to take actions\ncontrary to their interests. For example,\nPNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase dividends or\notherwise return capital to shareholders is\nsubject to PNC\u2019s compliance with its SCB,\nwhich is determined at least annually through\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process. The\nFederal Reserve can also impose additional\nlimitations on capital distributions, such as\nthe limitations on distributions imposed in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. In\naddition, dividends from PNC Bank and, to a\nlesser extent, non-bank subsidiaries are PNC\u2019s\nprincipal source of funds to, among other\nthings, pay dividends on and make repurchases\nof its capital stock. Many of our subsidiaries\nare subject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to\nprohibit or limit dividends to PNC.\nLimitations on PNC\u2019s ability to receive\ndividends from its subsidiaries, including PNC\nBank, could have a material adverse effect on\nits liquidity and ability to pay dividends on\nand make repurchases of its capital stock.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements may also\nimpact the amount and type of loans we make.\nWe may be constrained in our ability to\nexpand, either organically or through\nacquisitions. We may be forced to sell or\nrefrain from acquiring assets where the\ncapital requirements appear inconsistent with\nthe assets\u2019 underlying risks. In addition,\nliquidity standards require us to maintain\nholdings of highly liquid short-term\ninvestments, thereby reducing our ability to\ninvest in longer-term or less liquid assets,\neven if more desirable from an earnings,\nbalance sheet or interest rate risk management\nperspective.\n\nThe Basel Committee continues to engage in\ncapital- and liquidity-related initiatives.\nSee the Supervision and Regulation section\nincluded in Item 1 of this Report. As it is\nunclear, at this time, whether or how these\ninitiatives will be implemented in the U.S.,\nwe are unable to estimate what potential\nimpact such initiatives may have on us .\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nare subject to regular review and revision by\nthe Basel Committee and the U.S. banking\nagencies. For example, under the 2019\nTailoring Rules, certain BHCs are classified\nas Category I, Category II, Category III or\nCategory IV firms. While PNC and PNC Bank\ncurrently are Category III firms, if PNC or\nPNC Bank would become a Category I or II\ninstitution, we would be subject to more\nstringent capital and liquidity standards\nwhich would likely increase some of the\npotential adverse effects described above.\nFuture changes to the capital and liquidity\nrules to require PNC or PNC Bank to maintain\nmore or higher quality capital or greater\nliquidity would also likely increase some of\nthe potential adverse effects described above.\n\nThe regulatory capital and liquidity\nframeworks as well as certain other prudential\nrequirements and standards that are applicable\nto PNC are discussed in the Supervision and\nRegulation section included in Item 1 of this\nReport and the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly impact our liquidity, funding\ncosts and access to the capital markets.\n\nOur credit ratings are based on a number of\nfactors, including the financial strength of\nPNC and PNC Bank, and factors outside of our\ncontrol, such as conditions affecting the\nfinancial services industry generally.\nReductions in one or more of our credit\nratings could adversely affect our ability to\nborrow funds and increase our cost of capital\nand limit the number of investors or\ncounterparties willing to do business with or\nlend to us. For example, downgrades could\nnegatively impact our right to continue to\nservice mortgages. Downgrades could also\nadversely affect our ability to attract or\nretain customers, including deposits. In\naddition, a downgrade in our credit ratings\ncould trigger obligations to make cash or\ncollateral payments under derivative contracts\nwith certain counterparties. There can be no\nassurance that we will maintain our current\nratings and outlooks. For information on our\ncredit ratings, see the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of Item 7 of this Report.\n\nThe scheduled discontinuance of LIBOR presents\nrisks to the financial instruments originated,\nheld or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a\nreference rate.\n\nAs a large financial institution, a\nsignificant portion of our transactions\ninvolve variable or adjusting interest rates\nthat are calculated by adding a contractually\ndefined credit spread to a base or reference\nrate. For many years, LIBOR has been used as a\nreference rate for a substantial majority of\nour transactions involving variable or\nadjustable interest, including those in which\nwe lend money, issue securities, or purchase\nand sell securities issued by others, as well\nas many derivative transactions that we enter\ninto to manage our or our customers\u2019 risk. We\nalso service financial instruments entered\ninto by others that use LIBOR as the reference\nrate.\n\nAs announced by ICE Benchmark Administration\nLimited and the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority, non-USD LIBOR ceased to be\navailable at year end 2021 and we currently\nanticipate that the most widely used USD LIBOR\ntenor settings will cease after June 30, 2023.\nAccordingly, we are preparing for LIBOR\ncessation and, based upon guidance\ncommunicated by the Federal Reserve and other\nofficial sector representatives, PNC stopped\nentering into new USD LIBOR contracts as of\nDecember 31, 2021, subject to certain limited\nexceptions.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 19\nCurrently, SOFR is the alternative reference\nrate replacing LIBOR for most types of\ntransactions. SOFR is viewed as a \u201criskless\nrate\u201d as it is derived from rates on overnight\nU.S. Treasury repurchase transactions, which\nare essentially overnight loans secured by\nU.S. Treasury securities, and are largely\nviewed as not presenting credit risk. The BSBY\nis another alternative reference rate that is\nin use primarily in the loan market. BSBY is\nintended to reflect large banks\u2019 marginal\nwholesale cost of funds and is a credit-\nsensitive rate with a forward-looking term\nstructure.\n\nChanging to SOFR or another riskless rate\ncould result in a value transfer between\ncontracting parties to instruments originally\nbased on LIBOR. Historically, in periods of\neconomic or financial industry stress,\nriskless rates that are analogous to SOFR have\nbeen relatively stable. In contrast, LIBOR,\nwhich is designed to reflect the credit risk\nof banks, has widened relative to riskless\nrates, reflecting increased uncertainty\nregarding the creditworthiness of banks.\nAccordingly, if SOFR behaves like its\nhistorical analogs, an instrument that\ntransitions from LIBOR to SOFR may not yield\nidentical economic outcomes for each\ncontracting party to an instrument had the\ninstrument continued to reference LIBOR.\nSimilarly, SOFR, because it is riskless, tends\nto be a lower rate than LIBOR. To address\nthese differences between LIBOR and SOFR,\ncertain industry-recommended LIBOR fallback\nprovisions include a concept of an adjustment\nspread that is applied when a LIBOR-based\ncontract falls back to SOFR and that is\ncalculated based on a five-year median look-\nback of the historical spot difference between\nthe applicable LIBOR tenor and the applicable\nSOFR tenor. However, because any such\nadjustment spread is and will be based on a\nhistorical median, such adjustment spreads\nhave not, and are likely in the future to not,\nreflect the spot difference between LIBOR and\nSOFR at certain points in time and there may\nbe a value transfer between the contracting\nparties over the life of the instrument\nbecause the all-in rate applied to a contract,\neven taking into account the spread\nadjustment, might have behaved differently\nover the life of the instrument in the absence\nof LIBOR cessation.\n\nAny value transfer could be financially\nadverse or beneficial to us or to our other\ncontracting parties to that instrument (such\nas a borrower, derivative counterparty or bond\nholder). Impacts from a change in reference\nrate would likely include changes to the yield\non, and value of, loans or securities held by\nus, amounts paid on securities we have issued,\namounts received and paid on derivative\ninstruments we have entered into and the\ntrading market for LIBOR-based securities. Any\ntheoretical benefit to us could result in\ncounterparty dissatisfaction, which, in turn\ncould lead to litigation, potentially as class\nactions, or other adverse consequences,\nincluding dissatisfied customers or impaired\nrelationships with financial institution\ncounterparties resulting in loss of business.\nAs a result, over the life of a transaction\nthat transitions from LIBOR to a new reference\nrate, our monetary obligations to our\ncounterparty (or their obligations to us) and\nthe yield we receive (or pay) from the\ntransaction with that counterparty may change\nfrom that which would have resulted from a\ncontinuation of LIBOR.\n\nChanging from LIBOR to BSBY substantially\nreduces the value transfer risks, and we use,\nand intend to continue to use, BSBY as a\nreference rate for a portion of our loan\nportfolio. Our ability to use BSBY more\nbroadly is limited by the current and\nanticipated widespread use of SOFR in capital\nand derivatives markets and because SOFR is\nthe preferred rate among certain domestic and\nglobal official sector entities.\n\nAnother set of risks associated with LIBOR\ncessation relates to how the transition from\nLIBOR to another rate will be effected. For\nsome instruments, the method of transitioning\nto a new reference rate may be challenging,\nespecially where the contract does not provide\nfor a transition upon LIBOR cessation or the\nrelevant contractual language relating to a\npotential transition is ambiguous or\ninadequate under the circumstances.\n\nFor example, most LIBOR-based interest rate\nderivative contracts executed prior to January\n25, 2021, do not include adequate fallbacks\nfor LIBOR cessation. In response, ISDA\npublished a protocol pursuant to which\nindustry participants can agree with any other\nindustry participant that adheres to the\nprotocol to include ISDA\u2019s new LIBOR fallback\nprovisions into legacy derivative contracts.\nAlthough we have adhered to the ISDA protocol,\nwe believe many \u201cend users\u201d of swaps (i.e.,\nour borrowers who have hedged their interest\nrate payment obligations) will not adhere. In\naddition, there are differences between the\nnew ISDA fallback provisions and the fallback\nprovisions that have been proposed for loans,\nwhich differences could result in a mismatch\nbetween the reference rate or other economics\nin our borrowers\u2019 legacy derivative contracts\nand their loans for which such derivative\ncontracts are intended as a hedge. For these\nend-user counterparties, one-on-one\nnegotiation with each counterparty will be\nnecessary to amend legacy swaps to adequately\naddress LIBOR cessation. If we are unable to\nagree to appropriate LIBOR cessation\nprovisions with these swaps\u2019 counterparties,\nrecently enacted New York State legislation\nwill incorporate fallback provisions into\nthese derivative contracts. However, these\nstatutory fallback provisions may not align\nwith fallback provisions in a loan for which\none of these derivative contracts is intended\nas a hedge. As a result, addressing transition\nunder these circumstances may be challenging\nor ineffective, could result in litigation,\nand in some cases may involve concession on\nour part that has the effect of reducing the\nvalue of the instrument to us.\n\nWe have other contracts that do contemplate\nLIBOR cessation but do so in a manner that may\ncreate other risks. For example, some\ncontracts provide for selecting replacement\nrates in a manner that presents significant\nchallenges (such as by assuming that there\nwould be a rate calculated substantially in\nthe same manner as LIBOR is) or that gives us\nor another party absolute discretion to select\na rate. Some provide for determination of a\nreference rate without providing for\nadjustment of the credit spread. In these\ntypes of cases, there will likely be\nuncertainty surrounding transition, with all\nof the risks described in this Risk Factor.\n\nTransitioning from LIBOR to alternative rates\nalso may result in operational errors during\nthe transition such that the replacement rate\nis not applied in a timely manner or is\nincorrectly applied. This is particularly true\ngiven the volume of contracts that will\nrequire transition and the diversity of\npotential approaches to transition and given\nthe possibility that the period during which\nthe transition will need to take place may\nhave a short duration. Similarly, our failure\nto successfully implement transition from\nLIBOR to alternative rates could result in\nregulatory scrutiny and actions by our\nregulators including fines and other\nsupervisory sanctions. It is\n\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nalso possible that LIBOR quotes will become\nunavailable prior to the currently anticipated\ncessation dates. In that case, the risks\nassociated with the transition to an\nalternative reference rate will be accelerated\nand magnified. These risks may also be\nincreased due to the shorter time for\npreparing for the transition.\n\nTransitioning from LIBOR to alternative rates\nalso impacts certain of our hedge accounting\nstrategies. Uncertainty about the application\nof ASC 848 Reference Rate Reform to pooled\ncash flow hedge strategies introduces\naccounting risk that could affect the extent\nto which we are able to apply this accounting\nin the future. See Note 1 Accounting Policies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report for more\ninformation about reference rate reform\naccounting standards impacts.\n\nTo address LIBOR cessation and the associated\nrisks, we have established an enterprise LIBOR\ntransition program, described in the Market\nRisk Management portion of the Risk Management\nsection in Item 7 of this Report. Any failure\nof this program to appropriately assess and\nmitigate risk and deliver in a timely manner\non operationalizing our ability to transition\nfrom LIBOR could magnify the risks previously\noutlined.\n\nNew customer privacy initiatives will impose\nadditional operational burdens on PNC, may\nlimit our ability to pursue desirable business\ninitiatives and increase the risks associated\nwith any future use of customer data.\n\nRecently there has been an increase in\nlegislative and regulatory efforts to protect\nthe privacy of consumer data. These\ninitiatives, among other things, limit how\ncompanies can use customer data and impose\nobligations on companies in their management\nof such data. Financial services companies\nsuch as PNC necessarily gather, maintain and\nuse a significant amount of customer data.\nThese types of initiatives increase compliance\ncomplexity and related costs, result in\nsignificant financial penalties for compliance\nfailures, and limit our ability to develop new\nproducts or respond to technological changes.\nSuch legal requirements also could heighten\nthe reputational impact of perceived misuses\nof customer data by us, our vendors or others\nwho gain unauthorized access to our customer\ndata. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar\nrequirements that impose different and\npotentially inconsistent compliance burdens.\nThe impacts will be greater to the extent\nrequirements vary across jurisdictions.\n\nClimate change and societal responses to\nclimate change could adversely affect our\nbusiness and performance, including indirectly\nthrough impacts on our customers.\n\nThere continues to be significant concern on\nthe part of scientists, public leadership and\nmany individuals regarding climate change and\nits impacts on virtually all aspects of life\nover the short- and long-term. These concerns\nover the current or anticipated impacts of\nclimate change have led and will continue to\nlead to governmental efforts around the world\nto mitigate those impacts. Consumers and\nbusinesses also are changing their behavior as\na result of these concerns. Climate change\nconcerns also create transition risk for PNC\narising from the process of adjusting to these\nconcerns, including transitioning to a low-\ncarbon economy. PNC and its customers will\nneed to respond to new laws and regulations as\nwell as consumer and business preferences as a\nresult. We and our customers may face cost\nincreases, asset value reductions, operating\nprocess changes and the like, as a result of\nclimate change and governmental actions or\nsocietal responses to climate change. The\nimpact on our customers will likely vary\ndepending on their specific attributes,\nincluding their reliance on or role in carbon\nintensive activities as well as their exposure\nto the effects of climate change. Among the\nimpacts to PNC could be a drop in demand for\nour products and services, particularly in\ncertain sectors, or increased losses due to\nthe impact of climate change (such as severe\nweather events) on PNC's operations or the\ncollateral that secures customer borrowings.\nIn addition, we could face reductions in\ncreditworthiness on the part of some customers\nor in the value of assets securing loans,\npressure from individuals or groups to cease\ndoing business with certain companies or\nsectors, or additional regulatory restrictions\nor costs associated with providing products or\nservices to certain companies or sectors.\nEnvironmental regulations or changes in the\nsupply, demand or available sources of energy\nor other resources may affect the availability\nor cost of goods and services necessary to run\nour business. The Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are\nat risk for an adverse impact on our business\ndue to damage to our reputation\u201d has further\ndiscussion of risks associated with activist\npressure. Our efforts to take these risks into\naccount in making lending and other decisions,\nincluding by increasing our business with\nclimate-friendly companies, may not be\neffective in protecting us from the negative\nimpact of new laws and regulations or changes\nin consumer or business behavior, including\nthose resulting from activist pressure. Our\nrisk management may not be effective in\nidentifying, measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling climate risk exposure particularly\ngiven that the timing, nature and severity of\nthe impacts of climate change may not be\npredictable.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Use of Technology      \n                                              \nThe use of technology is critical to our\nability to maintain or enhance the\ncompetitiveness of our businesses.\n\nAs a large financial services company, we\nhandle a substantial volume of customer and\nother financial transactions. As a result, we\nrely heavily on information systems to conduct\nour business and to process, record and\nmonitor our transactions and those of our\ncustomers. Over time, we have seen more\ncustomer usage of technological solutions for\nfinancial needs as well as higher expectations\nof customers and regulators regarding\neffective and safe systems operation. In many\ncases, the effective use of technology\nincreases efficiency and enables financial\ninstitutions to better serve customers. As a\nresult of these factors, the financial\nservices industry is undergoing rapid\ntechnological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services. Examples include\nexpanded use of cloud computing, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, virtual and\naugmented reality, biometric authentication,\nvoice and natural language, data protection\nenhancements and increased online and mobile\ndevice interaction with customers, including\ninnovative ways that customers can make\npayments or manage their accounts. The\nemergence of many of these technologies\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 21\nwas accelerated as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic and the shift to increased digital\nactivity. We expect these trends to continue\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer\nbehavior and expectations, as well as\ncompetitive pressures, we have been investing\nin technology and connectivity. We are seeking\nto automate functions previously performed\nmanually, facilitate the ability of customers\nto engage in financial transactions and\notherwise enhance the customer experience with\nrespect to our products and services. This\neffort has involved the expenditure of\nconsiderable amounts of funds and other\nresources. A failure to maintain or enhance\nour competitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because we fail to\nanticipate customer expectations or because\nour technological developments fail to perform\nas desired or are not rolled out in a timely\nmanner or because we fail to keep pace with\nour competitors, would likely cause us to lose\nmarket share or incur additional expense. Our\nability to maintain or enhance our relative\ntechnological position is in part dependent on\nour ability to attract and retain talented\nemployees in these fields, which, due to\noverall demand, is increasingly difficult.\n\nOur use of technology is dependent on having\nthe right to use the underlying intellectual\nproperty.\n\nIn some cases, we develop internally the\nintellectual property embedded in the\ntechnology we use. In others, we or our\nvendors license it from others. Regardless of\nthe source of the intellectual property, if\nanother person or entity were deemed to own\nintellectual property rights infringed by our\nactivities, we could be responsible for\nsignificant damages covering past activities\nand substantial fees to continue to engage in\nthese types of activities. It also is possible\nthat we could be prevented from using\ntechnology important to our business for at\nleast a period of time. In such a\ncircumstance, there may be no alternative\ntechnology for us to use or an appropriate\nalternative technology might be expensive to\nobtain. Protections offered by those from whom\nwe license technology against these risks may\nbe inadequate to cover fully any losses. Over\ntime, there have been instances where\ntechnology used by PNC and other financial\ninstitutions has been alleged to have\ninfringed patents held by others, and in some\ncases we, as well as other financial\ninstitutions, have suffered related losses.\n\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from\ninterruptions in the effective operation of\nour information systems and other technology.\n\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and\nresiliency of our information systems and\nother technology has become more important and\nmore challenging, and the costs involved in\nthat effort continue to be high. Effective\nmanagement of our current expanded remote work\nenvironment heightens our need for secure,\nreliable and adequate information systems and\ntechnology. The risks of operational failures\nin the use of these systems result from a\nvariety of factors. We are vulnerable to the\nimpact of failures of our systems to operate\nas needed or intended. Failures leading to\nmaterially adverse impacts could include those\nresulting from human error, unexpected\ntransaction volumes, or overall design or\nperformance issues. In addition, our ability\nto use our technology effectively could be\nimpacted due to electrical or\ntelecommunications outages, bad weather,\ndisasters, bad actors, terrorism and the like.\nSuch events could affect our systems directly\nor limit our ability to use our technology due\nto effects on key underlying infrastructure.\nIn some cases, the risk results from the\npotential for bad acts on the part of others,\ndiscussed in more detail in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cWe are vulnerable to the risk of third\nparty breaches of data security affecting the\nfunctioning of systems or the confidentiality\nof information, either at PNC or at third\nparties handling PNC information.\u201d\n\nWe also rely on information systems maintained\nby other companies. We use other companies\nboth to provide products and services directly\nto us and to assist in providing products and\nservices to our customers. Others provide the\ninfrastructure that supports, for example,\ncommunications, payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems, or information processing\nand storage. These companies range from those\nproviding highly sophisticated information\nprocessing to those that provide fundamental\nservices, such as electric power and\ntelecommunications. In some cases, these other\ncompanies themselves utilize third parties to\nsupport their delivery of products and\nservices to us and our customers. Systems\nmaintained by or for these other companies are\ngenerally subject to many of the same risks we\nface with respect to our systems and thus\ntheir issues could have a negative impact on\nPNC. We necessarily have less ability to\nprovide oversight over other companies\u2019\ninformation systems.\n\nA number of our customers choose to use\nfinancial applications (apps) that allow them\nto view banking and other financial account\ninformation, often held at different financial\ninstitutions, on a single platform, to monitor\nthe performance of their investments, to\ncompare financial and investment products, to\nmake payments or transfer funds, and otherwise\nto help manage their finances and investments.\nFinancial apps often ask users to provide\ntheir secure banking log-in information and\ncredentials (username and password) so the\napps can link to users\u2019 accounts at financial\ninstitutions. Companies offering these apps\nfrequently use third-party data aggregators,\nwhich are behind-the-scenes technology\ncompanies that serve as a data-gathering\nservice provider, to deliver customer\nfinancial data that is used by the financial\napps. To do this, data aggregators are\nprovided with customers\u2019 log-in information\nand credentials, which allows the aggregators\nto access the customers\u2019 online account and\n\u201cscrape\u201d the customers\u2019 data, often on a daily\nor even more frequent basis. That same\ninformation has the potential to facilitate\nfraud if it is not properly protected. In\nfact, a Director of the FinCEN stated that\nFinCEN had seen high incidences of fraud,\nincluding automated clearing house fraud,\ncredit card fraud, and wire fraud, enabled\nthrough the use of synthetic identities and\nthrough account takeovers via these platforms.\nIn some cases, cybercriminals appear to be\nusing such data aggregators and integrators to\nfacilitate account takeovers and fraudulent\nwires. PNC has and may continue to face\nincreased financial exposure due to fraudulent\nactivity associated with the increased use of\nthese apps and data aggregators. Even where\nPNC does not have responsibility for fraud\nlosses associated with these apps and data\naggregators, PNC could suffer increased\nreputational harm when such losses occur.\n\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nAlthough we regularly update and replace\nsystems that we depend on as our needs evolve\nand technology improves, we continue to\nutilize some older systems that may not be as\nreliable as newer ones. In addition, the\nimplementation of and transition to new or\nupdated systems creates risks related to\nassociated timing and costs, disruptions in\nfunctionality for customers and longer-term\nfailures to achieve desired improvements.\n\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or\nsecurity breach of any of our information or\ncommunications systems, or the systems of\nother companies on which we rely, could result\nin a wide variety of adverse consequences to\nus. This risk is greater if the issue is\nwidespread, extends for a significant period\nof time, or results in financial losses to our\ncustomers. The consequences of failures to\noperate systems properly can result in\ndisruptions to our critical business\noperations, including our ability to use our\naccounting, deposit, loan, payment and other\nsystems. Such events could also cause errors\nin transactions or impair system functionality\nwith customers, vendors or other parties.\nPossible adverse consequences also include\ndamage to our reputation or a loss of customer\nbusiness, which could occur even if the\nnegative impact on customers was de minimis.\nWe also could face litigation or additional\nregulatory scrutiny. This in turn could lead\nto liability or other sanctions, including\nfines and penalties or reimbursement of\nadversely affected customers. Even if we do\nnot suffer any material adverse consequences\nas a result of events affecting us directly,\ninformation systems issues at other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a general loss of\ncustomer confidence in financial institutions,\nincluding us. Also, system problems, including\nthose resulting from third party attacks,\nwhether at PNC or at our competitors, would\nlikely broadly increase legislative,\nregulatory and customer concerns regarding the\nfunctioning, safety and security of such\nsystems. In that case, we would expect to\nincur even higher levels of costs with respect\nto prevention and mitigation of these risks.\n\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of third party\nbreaches of data security affecting the\nfunctioning of systems or the confidentiality\nof information, either at PNC or at third\nparties handling PNC information.\n\nWe are faced with ongoing, bordering on\ncontinual, efforts by others to breach data\nsecurity at financial institutions or with\nrespect to financial transactions. Some of\nthese involve efforts to enter our systems\ndirectly by going through or around our\nsecurity protections. Others involve the use\nof social engineering schemes to gain access\nto confidential information from our\nemployees, customers or vendors. Our risk and\nexposure to data security breaches is\nheightened as a result of our remote work\nenvironment, which results in more access\npoints to our network. Most corporate and\ncommercial transactions are now handled\nelectronically, and our retail customers\nincreasingly use online access and mobile\ndevices to bank with us. The ability to\nconduct business with us in this manner\ndepends on the transmission and storage of\nconfidential information in electronic form.\nAs a result, efforts by bad actors to engage\nin various types of cyber attacks pose serious\nrisks to our business and reputation. The same\nrisks are presented by attacks potentially\naffecting information held by third parties on\nour behalf or accessed by third parties,\nincluding those offering financial apps, on\nbehalf of our customers. These risks also\narise to the extent that third parties with\nwhom we do business are subject themselves to\nbreaches and attacks which may impact our\nsystems.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we\nmaintain and process vast amounts of\ninformation about us, our customers and our\nemployees. This information tends to be\nconfidential or proprietary and much of it is\nhighly sensitive. The highly sensitive\ninformation includes information sufficient to\nsupport identity theft and personal health\ninformation, as well as information regarding\nbusiness plans and financial performance that\nhas not been made public. One way in which bad\nactors attempt to harm us is by seeking access\nto some of this confidential or proprietary\ninformation, often with the intent of stealing\nfrom or defrauding us or our customers. In\nother cases, they seek to disrupt our ability\nto conduct our business, including by\ndestroying or impairing our access to\ninformation maintained by us.\n\nOur customers often use their own devices,\nsuch as computers, smartphones and tablets, to\ndo business with us and may provide their PNC\ncustomer information (including passwords) to\na third party in connection with obtaining\nservices from the third party, including those\noffering financial apps. Although we take\nsteps to provide safety and security for our\ncustomers\u2019 transactions with us and their\ncustomer information to the extent they are\nutilizing their own devices or providing third\nparties access to their accounts, our ability\nto assure such safety and security is\nnecessarily limited.\n\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued\ncredit and debit cards to pay for transactions\nwith retailers and other businesses, there is\nalso the risk of data security breaches at\nthose other businesses covering PNC account\ninformation. When our customers use PNC issued\ncards to make purchases from those businesses,\ncard account information often is provided to\nthe business. If the business\u2019s systems that\nprocess or store card account information are\nsubject to a data security breach, holders of\nour cards who have made purchases from that\nbusiness may experience fraud on their card\naccounts. We can be responsible for\nreimbursing our customers for such fraudulent\ntransactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as\nwell as for other costs related to data\nsecurity compromise events, such as replacing\ncards associated with compromised card\naccounts. In addition, we provide card\ntransaction processing services to some\nmerchant customers under agreements we have\nwith payment networks such as Visa and\nMastercard. Under these agreements, we may be\nresponsible for certain losses and penalties\nif one of our merchant customers suffers a\ndata security breach. Over the last few years,\nseveral large companies disclosed that they\nhad suffered substantial data security\nbreaches compromising millions of user\naccounts and credentials. Moreover, to the\nextent more consumer confidential information\nbecomes available to bad actors through the\ncumulative effect of data breaches at\ncompanies generally, bad actors may find it\neasier to use such information to gain access\nto our customer accounts.\n\nOther cyber attacks are not focused on gaining\naccess to credit card or user credential\ninformation, but instead seek access to a\nrange of other types of confidential\ninformation, such as internal emails and other\nforms of customer financial information.\nRansomware\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 23\nattacks have sought to deny access to data and\npossibly shut down systems and devices\nmaintained by target companies. In a\nransomware attack, system data is encrypted or\naccess is otherwise denied, accompanied by a\ndemand for ransom to restore access to the\ndata.\n\nA number of companies have fallen victim to\nBEC scams in recent years. BEC scams involve\nusing social engineering to cause employees to\nwire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken\nbelief that the requests were made by a\ncompany executive or established vendor.\nAttacks on our customers may put these\nrelationships at risk, particularly if\ncustomers\u2019 ability to continue operations is\nimpaired due to the losses suffered.\n\nOther attacks in recent years have included\ndistributed denial of service cyber attacks,\nin which individuals or organizations flood\ncommercial websites with extraordinarily high\nvolumes of traffic with the goal of disrupting\nthe ability of commercial enterprises to\nprocess transactions and possibly making their\nwebsites unavailable to customers for extended\nperiods of time. We (as well as other\nfinancial services companies) have been\nsubject to such attacks.\n\nThe techniques used in cyber attacks change\nrapidly and frequently and are increasingly\nsophisticated and we may not be able to\nanticipate cyber attacks or information or\ndata security breaches.\n\nIn addition to threats from external sources,\ninsider threats represent a significant risk\nto us. Insiders, including those having\nlegitimate access to our systems and the\ninformation contained in them, have the\neasiest opportunity to make inappropriate use\nof the systems and information. Addressing\nthat risk requires understanding not only how\nto protect us from unauthorized use and\ndisclosure of data, but also how to engage\nbehavioral analytics and other tools to\nidentify potential internal threats before any\ndamage is done.\n\nTo date, while some of these types of attacks\nhave succeeded against us to some extent, none\nof these types of attacks have had a material\nimpact on us. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely\nblock efforts by bad actors to harm us. And\nour efforts to prevent significant harm from\nattacks may be insufficient. While we maintain\ninsurance coverage that may cover certain\naspects of cyber risks, such insurance\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all\nlosses. As a result, we could suffer material\nfinancial and reputational losses in the\nfuture from any of these or other types of\nattacks or the public perception that such an\nattack on our systems has been successful,\nwhether or not this perception is correct.\nAttacks on others, some of which have led to\nserious adverse consequences, demonstrate the\nrisks posed by new and evolving types of cyber\nattacks. Our ability to protect confidential\nor proprietary information is even more\nlimited with respect to information held by\nthird parties. We may suffer reputational\ndamage or legal liability for unauthorized\naccess to customer information held by third\nparties, even if we were in fact not\nresponsible for preventing such access and had\nno reasonable way of preventing it.\n\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk\nof failures or breaches occurring in our\ninformation systems and to mitigate the impact\nwhen they do.\n\nWe have policies, procedures and systems\n(including cyber security and business\ncontinuity programs) designed to prevent or\nlimit the effect of possible failures,\ninterruptions or breaches in security of\ninformation systems. In recent years, we have\ndevoted significant resources towards\nimproving the reliability of our systems and\ntheir security against external and internal\nthreats and expect to continue to do so in the\nfuture. We design our business continuity and\nother information and technology risk\nmanagement programs to manage our capabilities\nto provide services in the case of an event\nresulting in material disruptions of business\nactivities affecting our employees,\nfacilities, technology or suppliers. We cannot\nguarantee the effectiveness of our policies,\nprocedures and systems to protect us in any\nfuture situation, nor the effectiveness of our\noversight of risk at third parties. Our\nability to implement policies, procedures and\nsystems designed to prevent or limit the\neffect of possible failures, interruptions or\nbreaches in security of information systems\nwith respect to third party systems and the\nfinancial services industry infrastructure is\nnecessarily limited. Should an adverse event\naffecting another company\u2019s systems occur, we\nmay not have financial protection from the\nother company sufficient to compensate us or\notherwise protect us from the consequences.\n\nMethods used by others to attack information\nsystems change frequently (with generally\nincreasing sophistication). A new method of\nattack often is not recognized until launched\nagainst a target. Attacks in some cases appear\nto be supported by foreign governments or\nother well-financed entities and often\noriginate from less regulated and remote areas\naround the world. As a result, we may be\nunable to implement adequate preventive\nmeasures to address these methods in advance\nof attacks.\n\nEven with our proactive and defensive measures\nin place, adverse events are likely to occur,\nand there remains the risk that one or more\nsuch events would be material to PNC. Our\nability to mitigate the adverse consequences\nof such occurrences is in part dependent on\nthe quality of our business continuity\nplanning, our ability to understand threats to\nus from a holistic perspective, and our\nability to anticipate the timing and nature of\nany such event that occurs, with novel or\nunusual events posing a greater risk. It is\nalso the case that an adverse event can go\nundetected for a period of time, with the\nadverse consequences likely greater the longer\nit takes to discover the problem. In many\ncases, it also depends on the preparedness and\nresponses of national or regional governments,\nincluding emergency responders, or on the part\nof other organizations and businesses with\nwhich we deal.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Risks Related to the Business of Banking    \n                                              \nOur business and financial results are subject\nto risks associated with the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business. It results from, among\nother things, extending credit to customers,\npurchasing securities, and entering into\nfinancial derivative transactions and certain\nguarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our\nmost significant risks, particularly given the\nhigh percentage of our assets represented\ndirectly or indirectly by loans and securities\nand the importance of lending activity to our\noverall business. We manage credit risk by\nassessing and monitoring the creditworthiness\nof our customers and counterparties, by\ndiversifying our loan portfolio, by obtaining\nand monitoring collateral for certain\nexposures and by investing primarily in high\nquality securities.\n\nA borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan can be\nadversely affected by many factors. Individual\nborrowers can be affected, for example, by\ndeclines in income, job losses, health issues\nor family issues. Commercial borrowers can be\naffected, for example, by poor business\nperformance, changes in customer behavior or\ncatastrophic losses. Weakness in the economy\nor in financial markets would typically\nadversely impact the ability of our borrowers\nto repay outstanding loans. We are exposed to\nincreased credit risk if we fail to evaluate\nproperly at origination the likely ability of\na borrower to repay a loan. Properly\nestimating the current and potential value of\nany collateral pledged to support the loan\nalso is critical to effectively managing\ncredit risk. A failure to identify declining\ncreditworthiness of a borrower or declining\ncollateral value at a time when remedial\nactions could reduce our exposure also\nincreases credit risk. Any decrease in our\nborrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans would result\nin higher levels of nonperforming loans, net\ncharge-offs, provision for credit losses and\nvaluation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nManaging credit risk effectively also relies\non forecasts of future overall economic\nconditions, which are inherently imperfect.\n\nIn addition to credit risk associated with our\nlending activities, we have credit risk\narising from many other types of business\nrelationships. Routine transactions give us\ncredit exposure to brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds, other institutional clients, as\nwell as vendors and other non-financial\nentities.\n\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when the\nvalue of collateral held by us to secure\nobligations to us cannot be realized,\nincluding because of legal or regulatory\nchanges, or is liquidated at prices that are\nnot sufficient to recover the full amount of\nthe loan or derivative exposure due to us. In\naddition, credit risk may be exacerbated when\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\n\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and\nlease portfolio through our ACL estimated\nunder CECL. Under CECL, the ACL reflects\nexpected lifetime losses, which could lead to\nvolatility in the allowance and the provision\nfor credit losses as economic forecasts,\nactual credit performance and other factors\nused in the loss estimating process change. We\nalso have reserves for unfunded loan\ncommitments and letters of credit. Changes to\nexpected losses are reflected in net income\nthrough provision for credit losses. An\nincrease in credit risk would likely lead to\nan increase in provision for credit losses\nwith a resulting reduction in our net income\nand would increase our allowance. An\nimprovement of economic conditions or our\neconomic outlook, particularly following a\nperiod of poor economic conditions, has and\ncould continue to result in a recapture of\nprovision for credit losses for a period of\ntime with a resulting increase in our net\nincome and decrease in our allowance that is\nnot likely to be sustained and that may\nobscure actual current operations and\nfinancial performance.\n\nFor a discussion of the increased credit risk\narising from the pandemic and its impact to\nour estimation of credit losses, see the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had\nand is likely to continue to have an adverse\neffect, possibly materially, on our overall\nbusiness and financial performance.\u201d\n\nThe concentration and mix of our loan\nportfolio could increase the potential for\nsignificant losses.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often\nhave heightened credit exposure to a\nparticular industry, region or financial\nmarket. As an example, loans secured by\ncommercial and residential real estate\ntypically represent a significant percentage\nof our overall credit portfolio. They also\nrepresent a portion of the assets underlying\nour investment securities. Although there are\nlimitations on the extent of total exposure to\nan individual consumer or business borrower,\nevents adversely affecting specific customers\nor counterparties, industries, regions or\nfinancial markets, including a decline in\ntheir creditworthiness or a worsening overall\nrisk profile, could materially and adversely\naffect us. Declining economic conditions also\nmay impact commercial borrowers more than\nconsumer borrowers, or vice versa. Thus, the\nconcentration and mix of our loan portfolio\nmay affect the severity of the impact of a\nrecession on us.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 25\nOur business and financial performance are\nimpacted significantly by market interest\nrates and movements in those rates.\n\nAs a result of the high percentage of our\nassets and liabilities that are in the form of\ninterest-bearing or interest-related\ninstruments, changes in interest rates, in the\nshape of the yield curve, or in spreads\nbetween different market interest rates can\nhave a material effect on our business, our\nprofitability and the value of our financial\nassets and liabilities. For example:\n\n\u2022 Changes in interest rates or interest rate\nspreads affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets such as loans\nand investment securities and the interest\nthat we pay on liabilities such as deposits\nand borrowings, which impacts our overall net\ninterest income and margin as well as our\nprofitability.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can affect the ability of\nborrowers to meet obligations under variable\nor adjustable rate loans and other debt\ninstruments, and can, in turn, increase our\ncredit losses on those assets.\n\n\u2022 Such changes can decrease the demand for\ninterest rate-based products and services,\nincluding loans and deposit accounts.\n\n\u2022 Such changes affect our hedging of various\nforms of market and interest rate risk and may\ndecrease the effectiveness of those hedges in\nhelping to manage such risks.\n\n\u2022 Movements in interest rates also affect loan\nprepayment speeds and could result in\nimpairments of mortgage servicing assets or\notherwise affect the profitability of such\nassets.\n\n\u2022 Increases in interest rates likely lower the\nprice we would receive on fixed-rate customer\nobligations if we were to sell them.\n\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments\nadjust promptly in accordance with changes in\nmarket rates, while others adjust only\nperiodically or are fixed throughout a defined\nterm. As a result, the impact of changes in\ninterest rates can be either increased or\ndiluted due to differences in the relative\nvariability of the rates paid on our\nliabilities in relation to the rates received\non our assets. The extent to which we have\nelected to hedge interest rate risk through\ninterest rate swaps also affects the impact of\nrate changes. We attempt to manage the balance\nsheet to increase our benefit or reduce\nnegative impacts from future movements in\ninterest rates, but failures to anticipate\nactual movements may have the opposite result.\nIn addition, we do not generally hedge all of\nour risk and the fact that we attempt to hedge\nany risk does not mean we will be successful.\n\nWhile higher interest rates generally enhance\nour ability to grow our net interest income,\nthere are risks associated with a rising\ninterest rate environment. As a general\nmatter, increasing rates tend to decrease the\nvalue of fixed-rate financial instruments held\non our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk\nFactor headed \u201cOur business and financial\nperformance are vulnerable to the impact of\nchanges in the values of financial assets.\u201d\nAlso, customers may be less willing overall to\nborrow at higher rates. Higher interest rates\nmay indirectly affect the value of asset\nclasses such as real estate typically financed\nthrough secured loans, with a resulting\nnegative effect on collateral securing such\nloans. As another example, there may be\nincreased competitive pressures as rates on\ndeposit products rise. The benefits of higher\ninterest rates are best achieved if we can\nincrease the rates on loans and other assets\nfaster than the rates on deposits and other\nliabilities increase. We may not be able to\nachieve this result in a rising rate\nenvironment.\n\nOn the other hand, lower interest rates tend\nto have a negative impact on our net interest\nmargin, and, unless offset by higher earning\nassets, on our net interest income. Moreover,\na negative interest rate environment, in which\ninterest rates drop below zero either broadly\nor for some types of instruments, could reduce\nour net interest margin and net interest\nincome due to a likely decline in the interest\nwe could earn on loans and other earning\nassets, while also likely requiring us to pay\nto maintain our deposits with the Federal\nReserve Bank. In addition, our systems may not\nbe able to handle adequately a negative\ninterest rate environment and not all variable\nrate instruments are designed for such a\ncircumstance.\n\nWe discuss the impact of governmental monetary\npolicy on interest rates in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cThe policies of the Federal Reserve\nand other governmental agencies have a\nsignificant impact on interest rates and\noverall financial market performance, which\nare important to our business and financial\nperformance.\u201d\n\nOur business and financial performance are\nvulnerable to the impact of changes in the\nvalues of financial assets.\n\nAs a financial institution, a substantial\nmajority of our assets and liabilities are\nfinancial in nature. Examples include loans,\nsecurities, servicing rights, deposits and\nborrowings. Such assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value, often significantly, due\nto movements in the financial markets or\nmarket volatility as well as developments\nspecific to the asset or liability in\nquestion. The underlying value of assets under\nlease or securing an obligation generally\ndecreases due to increases in supply or\ndecreases in demand for the asset or\ndeterioration in the condition of the asset.\nThis could negatively impact the ability to\ncollect fully on the secured obligation.\nCredit-based assets and liabilities will\nfluctuate in value due to changes in the\nperceived creditworthiness of borrowers or\nother counterparties and due to changes in\nmarket interest rates.\n\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and\nliabilities to market and recognize such\nchanges either through net income or OCI.\nThus, gains or losses on these assets and\nliabilities can have a direct impact on our\nresults of operations, unless we have\neffectively hedged our exposures. We may need\nto record losses in the value of financial\nassets even where our expectation of realizing\nthe face value of the underlying instrument\nhas not changed. Other assets and liabilities\nare not marked to market. As a result, our\nbalance sheet does not precisely represent the\nfair market value of our financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\n26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nIn addition, asset management revenue is\nearned primarily based on a percentage of the\nvalue of the assets being managed and thus is\nimpacted by general changes in market\nvaluations. Thus, although we are not directly\nimpacted by changes in the value of such\nassets, decreases in the value of those assets\nwould affect related noninterest income.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nOur asset and liability valuations and the\ndetermination of the amount of loss allowances\nand impairments taken on our assets are highly\nsubjective. Inaccurate estimates could\nmaterially impact our results of operations or\nfinancial position.\n\nOur accounting policies are key to how we\nreport our financial condition and results of\noperations. We must exercise judgment in\nselecting and applying many of these policies\nand methods to comply with GAAP and reflect\nmanagement\u2019s judgment regarding the most\nappropriate manner to report PNC\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nManagement\u2019s selection of the accounting\npolicy to apply, while reasonable and\nappropriate, could result in PNC reporting\ndifferent results than would have been\nreported under a different alternative. In\naddition, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, SEC and other regulatory agencies may\nissue new or amend existing accounting and\nreporting standards or change existing\ninterpretations of those standards that could\nmaterially affect our financial statements. In\nsome cases, PNC may be required to\nretrospectively apply a new or amended\nstandard resulting in changes to previously\nreported financial results.\n\nCertain accounting policies require that we\nuse estimates, assumptions and judgments in\npreparing our financial statements, including\nin determining credit loss reserves, reserves\nrelated to legal proceedings and the fair\nvalue of certain assets and liabilities, among\nother items. These policies require management\nto make difficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are inherently\nuncertain and different amounts could be\nreported under different conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. For example, CECL\nrequires us to make difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about economic and market\nconditions in determining the ACL.\n\nSome of our financial instruments, including\ncertain derivatives, debt securities, loans,\nMSRs and private equity investments, among\nother items, require a determination of their\nfair value for our financial statements.\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value\ninherently result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Changes in\nunderlying factors or assumptions in any of\nthe areas underlying our estimates could\nmaterially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations. During\nperiods of market disruption, it would be\ndifficult to value certain assets if trading\nbecomes less frequent and/or market data\nbecomes less observable. There may be certain\nasset classes that were historically traded in\nactive markets with significant observable\ndata that rapidly become illiquid due to\nmarket volatility, a loss in market confidence\nor other factors. In addition, we have assets\nand liabilities carried at fair value that are\nestimated using unobservable inputs that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities. The valuation of any asset or\nliability substantially based on unobservable\ninputs is necessarily less reliable than those\nbased on active trading markets. Further,\nrapidly changing and unprecedented market\nconditions could materially impact the\nvaluation of assets as reported within our\nconsolidated financial statements. Our ability\nto hedge exposure is in part dependent on our\nability to value the related assets or\nliabilities.\n\nThe determination of the amount of loss\nallowances and asset impairments varies by\nasset type and is based upon our periodic\nevaluation and assessment of known and\ninherent risks associated with the respective\nasset class. Management updates its\nevaluations regularly and reflects changes in\nallowances and impairments in operations as\nsuch evaluations are revised. Although we have\npolicies and procedures in place to determine\nloss allowance and asset impairments, due to\nthe subjective nature of this area, the level\nof impairments taken, and allowances reflected\nin our financial statements may not accurately\nreflect the actual level of risk and the\namount of future losses.\n\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in our business.\n\nWe rely on models to measure risks and to\nestimate many financial values. We use models\nthroughout much of our business, relying on\nthem for much of our decision making. Examples\nof areas we use models include determining the\npricing of various products, grading loans and\nextending credit, measuring interest rate and\nother market risks, predicting or estimating\nlosses, assessing capital adequacy, and\ncalculating economic and regulatory capital\nlevels. We also use models to estimate the\nvalue of financial instruments and balance\nsheet items. In particular, we depend\nsignificantly on models for credit loss\naccounting under CECL.\n\nModels generally evaluate the performance of\nvarious factors under anticipated future\nconditions, relying on historical data to help\nbuild the model and in part on assumptions as\nto the future, often with respect to\nmacroeconomic conditions, to generate the\noutput. Poorly designed or implemented models,\nincluding in the choice of relevant historical\ndata or future-looking assumptions, present\nthe risk that our business decisions based on\ninformation incorporating model output will be\nadversely affected due to the inadequacy of\nthat information. For example, our models may\nnot be effective if historical data does not\naccurately predict future events or if our\nmodels rely on erroneous data, formulas,\nalgorithms or assumptions and our review\nprocesses fail to detect these flaws.\n\nInformation we provide to the public or to our\nregulators based on poorly designed or\nimplemented models could be inaccurate or\nmisleading. Some of the decisions that our\nregulators make, including those related to\ncapital distribution to our shareholders,\nwould likely be affected adversely if they\nperceive that the quality of the relevant\nmodels used is insufficient.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 27\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Our Need for Customers     \n                                              \nOur success depends on our ability to attract\nand retain customers for our products and\nservices.\n\nOur performance is subject to risks associated\nwith declines in customer demand for our\nproducts and services. As a result of the\nnature of those products and services, we are\nparticularly at risk for losses of economic\nconfidence or customer trust in us.\n\nEconomic and market developments may affect\nconsumer and business confidence levels. If\ncustomers lose confidence due to concerns\nregarding the economy, the demand for our\nproducts and services could suffer. If we fail\nto attract and retain customers, demand for\nour loans and other financial products and\nservices could decrease and we could\nexperience adverse changes in payment\npatterns. We could lose interest income from a\ndecline in credit usage and noninterest income\nfrom a decline in product sales, investments\nand other transactions.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customer\ndeposits is impacted by the levels of interest\nrates, as customers balance the benefits of\nbank accounts such as deposit insurance and\nsome of the convenience associated with more\ntraditional banking products against the\npossibility of higher yields from other\ninvestments. In general, if the spread between\nthe rates we offer and those offered by\nalternatives to bank accounts widens,\ncustomers are often willing to forego the\nbenefits of bank accounts (such as FDIC\ninsurance) for higher returns elsewhere. Our\ncustomers could remove money from checking,\nsavings or other types of deposit accounts\nwith us in favor of other banks or other types\nof cash management products. In such\ncircumstances, we would need either to\nincrease rates to levels that are seen as\ncompetitive or lose customers, in either case\nwith a negative impact to net interest income.\nIn addition, deposits are a low-cost source of\nfunds for us. Therefore, losing deposits could\nincrease our funding costs and reduce our net\ninterest income. Loss of customers could also\nharm noninterest income by decreasing fee-\nbearing transaction volume. In addition, when\nrates are higher, customers tend to shift\ndeposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to\ninterest-bearing ones, thereby negatively\nimpacting net interest income.\n\nOur customers increasingly use third party\nfinancial applications that are expected to\ninterface with their PNC accounts. This use\nleads to the risk that issues with respect to\nthe effective functioning of that interface,\nregardless of cause, could result in a loss of\ncustomers as they seek banking relationships\nthat work better with these other\napplications.\n\nNews or other publicity that harms our\nreputation, or harms the reputation of our\nindustry generally, also could cause a loss of\ncustomers or a reduction in the extent to\nwhich customers do business with us. This is\ndescribed further in the Risk Factor headed\n\u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\u201d\n\nIn our asset management business, investment\nperformance is an important factor influencing\nthe level of assets that we manage. Poor\ninvestment advice or performance could hurt\nrevenue and growth as existing clients might\nwithdraw funds in favor of better performing\nproducts. Additionally, the ability to attract\nfunds from existing and new clients might\ndiminish. Overall economic conditions may\nlimit the amount that customers are able or\nwilling to invest as well as the value of the\nassets they do invest. The failure or negative\nperformance of products of other financial\ninstitutions could lead to a loss of\nconfidence in similar products offered by us\nwithout regard to the performance of our\nproducts. Such a negative contagion could lead\nto withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity\nissues in such products and have an adverse\nimpact on our assets under management and\nasset management revenues and earnings.\n\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our\nbusiness due to damage to our reputation.\n\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract\nand retain customers and employees, and to\ngrow our business is dependent on maintaining\nour reputation and having the trust of our\ncustomers and employees. Many types of\ndevelopments, if publicized, can negatively\nimpact a company\u2019s reputation with adverse\nconsequences to its business.\n\nFinancial services companies are highly\nvulnerable to reputational damage when they\nare found to have harmed customers,\nparticularly retail customers, through conduct\nthat is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive,\nabusive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful.\nThere also may be reputational damage from\nhuman error or systems failures viewed as\nhaving harmed customers but not involving\nmisconduct, including service disruptions or\nnegative perceptions regarding our ability to\nmaintain the security of our technology\nsystems and protect client data. Our\nreputation may also be harmed by failing to\ndeliver products and services of the quality\nexpected by our customers. The reputational\nimpact is likely greater to the extent that\nthe bad conduct, error or failure are\npervasive, long-standing or affect a\nsignificant number of customers, particularly\nretail consumers. The negative impact of such\nreputational damage on our business may be\ndisproportionate to the actual harm caused to\ncustomers. It may be severe even if we fully\nremediate any harm suffered by our customers.\nFurthermore, because we conduct most of our\nbusinesses under the \u201cPNC\u201d brand, negative\npublic opinion about one business could also\naffect our other businesses. In addition, we\ncould suffer reputational harm and a loss of\ncustomer trust as a result of conduct of\nothers in the industry even where we have not\nengaged in the conduct. We use third parties\nto help in many aspects of our business, with\nthe risk that their conduct can affect our\nreputation regardless of the degree to which\nwe are responsible for it.\n\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nTo an increasing extent, financial services\ncompanies, including PNC, are facing criticism\nfrom social and environmental activists, with\naccompanying reputational risk. Activists\ntarget companies in our industry, including\nPNC, for engaging in business with specific\ncustomers or with customers in particular\nindustries, where the customers\u2019 activities,\neven if legal, are perceived as having harmful\nimpacts on matters such as environment,\nconsumer health and safety, or society at\nlarge. In addition, other activists target\ncompanies in our industry, including PNC,\nseeking increased transparency and action with\nrespect to environmental, social and\ngovernance activities, political activities\nand activities that are or may be perceived to\nbe politically partisan in nature. Activist\ncriticism has come in many forms, including\nprotests at PNC facilities. PNC, together with\nmany other financial services companies, have\nin recent years been criticized for financing\ncompanies engaged in, for example, extraction\nand distribution of fossil fuels, manufacture\nof nuclear and other weapons (including\npersonal firearms), private prisons and border\ncontrol activities. In contrast, recently\nstate laws affecting our industry have been\nproposed and in some cases enacted reflecting\nthe opposite approach. For example, to conduct\nmost business with a municipality in Texas,\nPNC must certify, among other things, that it\ndoes not discriminate against the firearms\nindustry or the fossil fuel industry. Many of\nthese issues are divisive without broad\nagreement as to the appropriate steps a\ncompany such as PNC should take and often with\nstrong feelings on both sides. As a result,\nhowever we respond to such criticism, we\nexpose ourselves to the risks that current or\npotential customers decline to do business\nwith us or current or potential employees\nrefuse to work for us. This can be true\nregardless of whether we are perceived by some\nas not having done enough to address activist\nconcerns or by others as having\ninappropriately yielded to activist pressures.\nActivist pressure can also be a factor in\ndecisions as to which business opportunities\nand customers we pursue, potentially resulting\nin foregone profit opportunities.\n\nWe may also face criticism, with accompanying\nreputational risk, from investors who are\nincreasingly focused on environmental, social\nand governance matters and the adequacy of\ncompanies\u2019 responses to these matters when\nmaking investment decisions.\n\nThe speed with which information now moves\nthrough social media and other news sources on\nthe internet means that negative information\nabout PNC can rapidly have a broadly adverse\nimpact on our reputation. This is true whether\nor not the information is accurate. Once\ninformation has gone viral, it can be hard to\ncounter it effectively, either by correcting\ninaccuracies or communicating remedial steps\ntaken for actual issues. The potential impact\nof negative information going viral means that\nmaterial reputational harm can result from a\nsingle discrete or isolated incident.\n\nWe are also subject to the risk of\nreputational harm resulting from conduct of\npersons identified as our employees but acting\noutside of the scope of their employment,\nincluding through their activities on personal\nsocial media.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nin terms of the products and services we offer\nand the geographic markets in which we conduct\nbusiness.\n\nWe are subject to intense competition both\nfrom other financial institutions and from\nnon-bank entities, including financial\ntechnology companies (often referred to as\nFinTech). In many cases, non-bank entities can\nengage in many activities similar to ours or\noffer products and services desirable to our\ncustomers without being subject to the same\ntypes of regulation, supervision and\nrestrictions as are applicable to banks, which\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nEmerging financial technologies, including\nwith respect to payment services, lending and\ndigital and crypto currencies, may affect our\ncustomers\u2019 needs and expectations for products\nand services. We may fail to attract or retain\ncustomers if we are unable to develop and\nmarket products and services that meet\nevolving customer needs or demands or if we\nare unable to deliver them effectively and\nsecurely to our customers. This is\nparticularly true to the extent that our\ncompetitors are better able to do so. We may\nalso fail to attract or retain customers if we\nare unwilling to provide products or services\nthat we deem to be speculative or risky. The\ncompetition we face is described in Item 1 of\nthis Report under \u201cCompetition.\u201d\n\nConsolidation in our industry, including among\nsmaller banks combining to form more\ncompetitive larger ones and between banks and\nnon-bank entities, could result in PNC facing\nmore intense competition, particularly in\nimpacted regions or with respect to particular\nproducts. As we expand into new markets, we\nmay face competitors with more experience and\nestablished relationships in these markets,\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to\ncompete.\n\nA failure to adequately address the\ncompetitive pressures we face could make it\nharder for us to attract and retain customers\nacross our businesses. On the other hand,\nmeeting these competitive pressures could\nrequire us to incur significant additional\nexpense or to accept risk beyond what we would\notherwise view as desirable under the\ncircumstances. In addition, in our interest\nrate sensitive businesses, competitive\npressures to increase rates on deposits or\ndecrease rates on loans could reduce our net\ninterest margin, negatively impacting our net\ninterest income.\n\nWe depend on skilled labor, and employee\nattrition, competition for talented employees\nand labor shortages may have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operations.\n\nOur performance is dependent on attracting and\nretaining talented and diverse employees. We\nface significant competition for these\nemployees across many of our businesses and\nsupport areas. This presents greater risk as\nwe expand into new markets, develop new\nproduct lines, or enhance staffing in certain\nareas, particularly technology. This\ncompetition leads to increased expenses in\naffected business areas. In addition, changes\nto the labor market as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (including elevated employee\nattrition,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 29\nlabor availability and wage inflation) have\nexacerbated and may continue to exacerbate the\nchallenges of attracting and retaining\ntalented and diverse employees. Limitations on\nthe way regulated financial institutions can\ncompensate their officers and employees,\nincluding those contained in pending rule\nproposals implementing requirements of Dodd-\nFrank, may make it more difficult for\nregulated financial institutions, including\nPNC, to compete with unregulated companies for\ntalent.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Other Operational Issues   \n                                              \nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity\nof employees, and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible, to manage\noperational risks.\n\nWe are a large company that offers a wide\nvariety of products and services to a broad\nand diverse group of customers. We rely on our\nemployees to design, manage, and operate our\nsystems and controls to assure that we\nproperly enter into, record and manage\nprocesses, transactions and other\nrelationships with customers, suppliers and\nother parties with whom we do business. In\nsome cases, we rely on employees of third\nparties to perform these tasks. We also depend\non employees and the systems and controls for\nwhich they are responsible to assure that we\nidentify and mitigate the risks that are\ninherent in our relationships and activities.\nThese concerns are increased when we change\nprocesses or procedures, introduce new\nproducts or services, or implement new\ntechnologies, as we may fail to adequately\nidentify or manage operational risks resulting\nfrom such changes. These concerns may be\nfurther exacerbated by employee turnover and\nlabor shortages.\n\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on\nemployees, whether ours or those of third\nparties, to perform these tasks and manage\nresulting risks, we are thus subject to human\nvulnerabilities. These range from innocent\nhuman error to misconduct or malfeasance,\npotentially leading to operational breakdowns\nor other failures. Our controls may not be\nadequate to prevent problems resulting from\nhuman involvement in our business, including\nrisks associated with the design, operation\nand monitoring of automated systems. We may\nalso fail to adequately develop a culture of\nrisk management among our employees.\n\nErrors by our employees or others responsible\nfor systems and controls on which we depend\nand any resulting failures of those systems\nand controls could result in significant harm\nto PNC. This could include customer\nremediation costs, regulatory fines or\npenalties, litigation or enforcement actions\nor limitations on our business activities. We\ncould also suffer damage to our reputation, as\ndescribed under \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse\nimpact on our business due to damage to our\nreputation.\u201d\n\nWe use automation, machine learning,\nartificial intelligence and robotic process\nautomation tools to help reduce some risks of\nhuman error. Nonetheless, we continue to rely\non many manual processes to conduct our\nbusiness and manage our risks. In addition,\nuse of automation tools does not eliminate the\nneed for effective design and monitoring of\ntheir operation to make sure they operate as\nintended. Enhanced use of automation may\npresent its own risks. Automated systems may\nthemselves experience outages or problems.\nSome tools are dependent on the quality of the\ndata used by the tool to learn and enhance the\nprocess for which it is responsible. Not only\nbad or missing data but also anomalous data\ncan adversely affect the functioning of such\ntools. It is possible that humans in some\ncases are better able than highly automated\ntools to identify that anomalous data is being\nused or that results are themselves anomalous.\n\nWe rely on third party vendors, service\nproviders and other counterparties to help\nsupport many aspects of our business. When we\ndo so, our direct control of activities\nrelated to our business is reduced, which\ncould introduce risk.\n\nOur use of third parties to support our\nbusiness needs typically means that we do not\ndirectly control the activities we are having\nthem perform. Any disruption in services\nprovided by these third parties could\nadversely affect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. Replacing third parties could also\nentail significant delay and expense. Risks\ncan arise through inadequate performance by\nthe third party (including by their downstream\nservice providers), specifically where that\nperformance could affect us or our customers,\nand even when the result of factors or events\nare beyond such third party\u2019s control. Many of\nthe kinds of risks presented by activities\nperformed by third parties are described\nelsewhere in these Risk Factors. For example,\nwe use outside companies to assist us in\nprocessing some confidential customer or\nemployee information. In such a case, a cyber\nattack on such a company may result in access\nto our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information.\nWe are also vulnerable, including to\nregulatory penalties, where an outside company\nfails to comply with legal requirements\nrelevant to its work on our behalf. We may in\nany such circumstance suffer financial losses,\nlegal consequences and injury to our\nreputation. Even if the other company makes us\nwhole for financial losses, which is not\nnecessarily the case, it is unlikely that it\nwould be able to restore any injury to our\nreputation. As a result, the use of third\nparties to assist in our business activities\nheightens the risks to us inherent in those\nactivities.\n                                              \n  Other Key Risks                             \n                                              \nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse\nresults in legal proceedings.\n\nMany aspects of our business involve\nsubstantial risk of legal liability. We have\nbeen named or threatened to be named as\ndefendants in various lawsuits arising from\nour business activities. In addition, we are\nregularly the subject of governmental\ninvestigations and other forms of regulatory\ninquiry. We also are at risk when we have\nagreed to indemnify others for losses related\nto legal proceedings\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nthey face, such as in connection with the sale\nof a business or assets by us. The results of\nthese legal proceedings could lead to\nsignificant monetary damages or penalties,\nrestrictions on the way in which we conduct\nour business or reputational harm.\n\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal\nproceedings when information related to the\nloss contingencies represented by those\nmatters indicates both that a loss is probable\nand that the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we do not have accruals for all\nlegal proceedings where we face a risk of\nloss. In addition, due to the inherent\nsubjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of the outcome of legal\nproceedings, amounts accrued often do not\nrepresent the ultimate loss to us from the\nlegal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nultimate future losses may be higher, and\npossibly significantly so, than the amounts\naccrued for legal loss contingencies. We\ndiscuss further the unpredictability of legal\nproceedings and describe certain of our\npending legal proceedings in Note 21 Legal\nProceedings in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring\nother financial services businesses from time\nto time. Sometimes these are businesses with\ntechnologies or other assets valuable to us\neven if they do not themselves provide\nfinancial services to customers. These\nacquisitions present a number of risks and\nuncertainties related both to the acquisition\ntransactions themselves and to the integration\nof the acquired businesses into PNC after\nclosing.\n\nAcquisitions of other companies or of\nfinancial assets and deposits and other\nliabilities present risks and uncertainties to\nus in addition to those presented by the\nnature of the business acquired. These risks\nand uncertainties are found in the acquisition\nof BBVA, including its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA, and its integration into\nPNC. Many of the same risks arise when we\nengage in strategic partnerships.\n\nSpecific factors that can affect the ultimate\nresults from acquisitions include, depending\non the nature of the business acquired, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Diligence Risk: Our ability to analyze the\nrisks presented by prospective acquisitions,\nas well as our ability to prepare in advance\nof closing for integration, depends, in part,\non the information we can gather with respect\nto the business we are acquiring. We may not\nhave access to all of the information that\nwould be desirable. Our pre-acquisition review\nof the business also impacts our ability to\nprepare for and execute on the integration of\nan acquired business.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy of Assumptions: We make certain\nassumptions related to an acquisition that may\nprove to be inaccurate. Anticipated benefits\n(such as cost savings from synergies or\nstrategic gains from being able to offer\nenhanced product sets) may take longer or\nrequire greater resources to achieve or may\nnot be achieved in their entirety.\nAcquisitions also may be substantially more\nexpensive or take longer to complete than\nanticipated. We may also incur unanticipated\ncosts in connection with the integration of an\nacquired business.\n\n\u2022 Regulatory Approval: Completing attractive\nacquisition opportunities generally requires\nvarious governmental and regulatory approvals\nand consents prior to closing. These\nauthorities have broad discretion, and\nregulatory approvals could be delayed,\nrestrictively conditioned or denied, including\ndue to regulatory issues we (or the target\ncompany) have, or may have, under any of the\nnumerous governmental regulations to which we\n(or they) are subject. Moreover, as a\ncondition to approval, governmental\nauthorities may impose requirements, require\ndivestitures or place restrictions on the\nconduct of the business of the combined\ncompany, which could limit the benefits of the\nacquisition or result in delay or the failure\nto close the acquisition. Significant\nacquisitions by large banks also often attract\npublic scrutiny, which may result in negative\npublicity that adversely affects our\nreputation. Our ability to make large\nacquisitions may be negatively impacted as\nwell by changes in leadership at the\nregulatory agencies responsible for reviewing\nor approving the transaction, changes in\nregulatory rules or standards or the\napplication of those rules or standards, or\nfuture regulatory initiatives designed to\nlimit systemic risk and the potential for a\nfinancial institution to become \u201ctoo big to\nfail.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Pre-closing Risk: Prospective acquisition\ntargets are also subject to their own risks\nthat we cannot manage or control prior to\nclosing. As a result, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash\nflows could be adversely affected after\nclosing to the extent that any such risks\nresult in non-indemnified losses for which we\nare responsible.\n\n\u2022 Target-specific Risk: Acquisition targets\nhave their own risks specific to their\nbusinesses that could impact the success of a\ntransaction.\n\n\u2022 If a significant aspect of the value of\ntransaction is intellectual property, the\nextent to which the intellectual property may\nbe utilized or protected and commercialized by\nPNC.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition includes loan portfolios,\nthe extent of actual credit losses and the\nrequired allowance for credit losses following\ncompletion of the acquisition.\n\n\u2022 If the acquisition involves entering into\nnew businesses or geographic or other markets,\npotential limitations on our ability to take\nadvantage of these opportunities because of\nour inexperience with respect to them.\n\n\u2022 The results of litigation and governmental\ninvestigations that may be pending at the time\nof the acquisition or be filed or commenced\nthereafter, because of an acquisition or\notherwise. It is often hard to predict the\nresults of such legal proceedings. It may also\nbe hard to anticipate what legal proceedings\nmay be started following an acquisition based\non the prior activities of the acquired\ncompany (and its predecessors).\n\n\u2022 If the acquired company depends on models\nfor, among other things, capital planning and\ncredit loss accounting, we may have to rely on\nthe acquired company\u2019s models post-closing\nprior to integrating the acquired company\u2019s\ndata into PNC\u2019s models. These models may be\ndesigned or implemented in a manner different\nthan the models used by PNC. As a result,\nincorporation of the acquired company\u2019s data\ninto our models could materially impact our\nresults of operations or financial position to\nthe extent that our estimates based on the\nacquired company\u2019s models prove to be\ninaccurate.\n\n\u2022 The acquired company may operate under\nenterprise risk management systems, policies\nand procedures that are different and less\nmature than those of PNC, and we may need to\nrely on the acquired company\u2019s enterprise risk\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 31\nmanagement systems, policies and procedures\nfor a period of time after acquisition, which\nmight limit PNC\u2019s ability to identify,\nmonitor, manage and report risks. The acquired\ncompany may also implement its policies and\nprocedures in a different manner than PNC\nwould, which may result in heightened\nregulatory, legal, operational or reputational\nrisk.\n\n\u2022 Retention Risk: The success of an\nacquisition generally is at least partially\ndependent on our ability to retain and expand\nupon the acquired company\u2019s customer base. It\nis also frequently subject to risks related to\nhuman capital, including, to the extent being\nretained, the quality of leadership of the\nacquired company.\n\n\u2022 Integration Risk: Successful integration of\nan acquired company may present challenges due\nto differences in policies, procedures and\nsystems, the level of details or\ncomprehensiveness of an acquired company\u2019s\nfinancial and business information and data,\nand corporate culture. Integration challenges\ncould also result in damage to our reputation,\nas described under \u201cWe are at risk for an\nadverse impact on our business due to damage\nto our reputation.\u201d\n\nOur business and financial performance could\nbe adversely affected, directly or indirectly,\nby disasters, natural or otherwise, by\nterrorist activities, by international\nhostilities or by domestic civil unrest.\n\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential\nimpact of disasters (whether caused naturally\nor by human conduct), pandemics, terrorist\nactivities, international hostilities and\ndomestic civil unrest can be predicted.\nHowever, these occurrences could adversely\nimpact us, for example, by causing significant\ndamage to our facilities or preventing us from\nconducting our business in the ordinary\ncourse. Also, their impact on our borrowers,\ndepositors, other customers, suppliers or\nother counterparties could result in indirect\nadverse effects on us. Other indirect adverse\nconsequences from disasters, pandemics,\nterrorist activities, international\nhostilities or domestic civil unrest could\nresult from impacts to the financial markets,\nthe economy in general or in any region, or\nkey parts of the infrastructure (such as the\npower grid) on which we and our customers\nrely. These types of indirect effects, whether\nspecific to our counterparties or more\ngenerally applicable, could lead, for example,\nto an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies\nor defaults that could result in PNC\nexperiencing higher levels of nonperforming\nassets, net charge-offs and provisions for\ncredit losses. They could also cause a\nreduction in demand for lending or other\nservices that we provide. To the extent that\nclimate change increases the frequency or\nseverity of adverse weather conditions, the\nimpact from these types of natural disasters\non us or our customers would be worse. The\nspecific risks associated with the COVID-19\npandemic are discussed in the Risk Factor\nheaded \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is\nlikely to continue to have an adverse effect,\npossibly materially, on our overall business\nand financial performance.\u201d\n\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse\nconsequences of such occurrences is in part\ndependent on the quality of our resiliency\nplanning. This includes our ability to\nanticipate the nature of any such event that\nmight occur.

The Board of Directors presently\nintends to continue the policy of paying\nquarterly cash dividends. The amount of any\nfuture dividends will depend on economic and\nmarket conditions, our financial condition and\noperating results, and other factors,\nincluding contractual restrictions and\napplicable government regulations and policies\n(such as those relating to the ability of bank\nand non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to\nthe parent company and regulatory capital\nlimitations).

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour view that:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to be softer in\nthe first quarter of 2022 due to the omicron\nvariant, and then pick up in the spring,\nremaining above the economy\u2019s long-run average\nthroughout this year. Consumer spending growth\nwill remain solid in 2022 due to good\nunderlying fundamentals.\n\n\u2022 Supply-chain difficulties, which weighed on\ngrowth in the second half of 2021, will\ngradually ease over the course of 2022. Labor\nshortages will remain a constraint this year,\nalthough strong wage growth will support\nconsumer spending.\n\n\u2022 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to\nstrong demand but limited supplies coming out\nof the pandemic for some goods and services.\nInflation will slow in 2022 as supply and\ndemand for these goods and services normalize,\nbut also broaden throughout the economy due to\nwage growth. Inflation will end 2022 above the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 0.25 percentage points five\ntimes in 2022 to reach a range of 1.25% to\n1.50% by the end of the year, and then further\nincrease the federal funds rate in 2023. The\nFederal Reserve will also end its purchases of\nlong-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed\nsecurities in March 2022, and then start to\nreduce its balance sheet in mid-2022.\n\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nItem 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report\nfor other factors that could cause future\nevents to differ, perhaps materially, from\nthose anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nFull year guidance for 2022 includes the\nimpact of twelve months of BBVA operations\ncompared to seven months in 2021.\n\nFor the full year 2022, compared to full year\n2021, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loan growth of approximately 10%,\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans to be up approximately 5%,\n\n\u2022 Revenue growth to be 8% to 10% (we now\nexpect revenue growth to be on the higher end\nof this range based on our revised projection\nof the number of increases to the federal\nfunds rate in 2022),\n\n\u2022 Expenses, excluding integration expense, to\nbe up 4% to 6%,\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate to be approximately\n18%, and\n\n\u2022 To generate positive operating leverage.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2022, compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2021, we expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans, excluding PPP, to be up\napproximately 1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be down approximately\n1% to 2%,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be down 4% to 6%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, excluding\nintegration costs, net securities and Visa\nactivity, to be between $375 million and $425\nmillion,\n\n\u2022 Total revenue to decline approximately 3% to\n5%,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense, excluding approximately\n$30 million of integration expense, to be down\napproximately 4% to 6%, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $100\nmillion and $150 million.\n\nAdditionally, as of year-end 2021, actions\nthat will drive our $900 million of\nanticipated savings related to the BBVA\nacquisition have been substantially completed,\nand we expect the savings to be fully realized\nin 2022. Since the announcement of the\nacquisition, we have incurred approximately\n95% of the total $980 million expected\nintegration costs, which include $120 million\nof write-offs for capitalized items.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 41\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ONSOLIDATED                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  I                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  NCOME                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  S                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  TATEMENT                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVIEW                                       \n                                              \nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented\nin Item 8 of this Report.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis and Analysis Of Year-To-Year Changes\nIn Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n\nNet interest income increased $701 million, or\n7% in 2021 compared with 2020. The increase\nwas primarily due to the benefit of BBVA\ninterest-earning asset balances and lower\ndeposit rates, partially offset by lower\nyields on securities. Net interest margin\ndecreased 24 basis points, largely due to\nlower yields on interest-earning assets as\nwell as higher balances held at the Federal\nReserve Bank, partially offset by lower rates\npaid on deposits and borrowings.\n\nAverage investment securities grew $23.7\nbillion, or 27%, primarily as a result of\nincreased purchase activity and the BBVA\nacquisition. Average investment securities\nrepresented 24% of average interest-earning\nassets in 2021, compared to 22% in 2020.\n\nAverage loans increased $16.1 billion, or 6%,\nprimarily as a result of the BBVA acquisition,\npartially offset by lower utilization of loan\ncommitments by commercial customers and\ndeclines in home equity, credit card and auto\nloans as paydowns outpaced new originations.\nAverage loans represented 57% of average\ninterest-earning assets in 2021 compared to\n64% in 2020.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\ngrew $32.5 billion as average balances held\nwith the Federal Reserve Bank increased\nprimarily due to higher liquidity from deposit\ngrowth.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits grew $40.5\nbillion, or 17%, due to overall growth in\ncommercial and consumer liquidity, including\ndeposits from BBVA.

The increase was\nalso attributable to the addition of BBVA,\nhigher treasury management product revenue and\nhigher revenue from commercial mortgage\nbanking activities.\n\nResidential mortgage revenue declined as\nhigher loan sales were more than offset by\nlower servicing fees and lower mortgage\nservicing rights valuation, net of economic\nhedge.\n\nService charges on deposits increased\nprimarily due to the addition of BBVA\ncustomers, partially offset by lower\ntransaction volumes including the impact of\nLow Cash Mode \u00ae on overdraft revenue. For\nadditional information on Low Cash Mode \u00ae ,\nsee the Business Segments Review section of\nthis Item 7.\n\nOther noninterest income increased primarily\ndue to higher private equity revenue,\npartially offset by lower net securities\ngains.

We have included credit ratings\ninformation because we believe that the\ninformation is an indicator of the degree of\ncredit risk to which we are exposed. Changes\nin credit ratings classifications could\nindicate increased or decreased credit risk\nand could be accompanied by a reduction or\nincrease in the fair value of our investment\nsecurities portfolio. We continually monitor\nthe credit risk in our portfolio and maintain\nthe allowance for investment securities at an\nappropriate level to absorb expected credit\nlosses on our investment securities portfolio\nfor the remaining contractual term of the\nsecurities adjusted for expected prepayments.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3\nInvestment Securities in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Report for additional details\nregarding the methodology for determining the\nallowance and the amount of the allowance for\ninvestment securities, respectively.\n\nThe duration of investment securities was 3.7\nyears at December 31, 2021. We estimate that\nat December 31, 2021 the effective\n\nduration of investment securities was 3.8\nyears for an immediate 50 basis points\nparallel increase in interest rates and 3.5\nyears for an\n\nimmediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in\ninterest rates. Comparable amounts at December\n31, 2020 for the effective duration of\n\ninvestment securities were 3.1 years and 2.0\nyears, respectively.\n\nBased on expected prepayment speeds,

earnings increased $804 million\nin 2021 compared with the same period in 2020.\nThe increase in earnings was attributable to a\nprovision recapture, higher net interest\nincome and higher noninterest income,\npartially offset by higher noninterest\nexpense. The 2021 amounts reflect the benefit\nof BBVA's business operations since the\nacquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\n\nNet interest income increased primarily due to\ngrowth in average deposits and loan balances,\nreflecting the BBVA acquisition, along with\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\nloans, partially offset by narrower interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits.\n\nNoninterest income increased due to higher\nconsumer services revenue driven by debit card\nand brokerage fees and higher service charges\non deposits which benefited from the addition\nof BBVA customers and higher business\nactivity. The increase in noninterest income\nwas partially offset by declines in\nresidential mortgage revenue, driven by lower\nnet servicing fees primarily due to higher\npayoffs and lower revenue from residential\nmortgage servicing rights valuation, net of\neconomic hedge.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 51\nProvision recapture in 2021 was driven by\nportfolio changes, including improved credit\nquality and changes in portfolio composition,\nalong with the impact from an improved\neconomic environment, partially offset by the\nadditional provision for credit losses related\nto the BBVA acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense increased, primarily as a\nresult of the impact of BBVA operating\nexpenses, increased marketing activity and\nadditions to litigation reserves.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In\n2021, average total deposits increased\ncompared to the same period in 2020 primarily\ndriven by growth in demand and savings\ndeposits which benefited from the impact of\nthe BBVA acquisition and continued government\nstimulus payments.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin 2021 compared with the same period in 2020\ndue to the impact of the BBVA acquisition on\nall loan classes except education loans, which\nBBVA did not have in their loan portfolio. The\nbelow outlines portfolio drivers excluding the\nimpact of BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Average residential real estate loans\nincreased primarily due to originations\noutpacing paydowns.\n\n\u2022 Average commercial loans increased primarily\ndue to PPP loans.\n\n\u2022 Average other consumer loans decreased due\nto liquidations outpacing new volumes.\n\n\u2022 Average credit card balances decreased due\nto changes in customer behavior resulting in\nhigher balance paydowns driven by government\nstimulus combined with credit tightening\nactions taken as a result of the pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Average education loans decreased driven by\na decline in the runoff portfolio of\ngovernment guaranteed education loans.\n\n\u2022 Average home equity loans decreased as\npaydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated\nvolume.\n\n\u2022 Average auto loan balances decreased due to\nthe impacts of the pandemic on the auto\nindustry and proactive credit tightening.\n\nOur national expansion strategy is designed to\ngrow customers with digitally-led banking and\na thin branch network as we expand into new\nmarkets. In 2018, we began offering our\ndigital high yield savings deposit product and\nopened our first solution center in Kansas\nCity. Solution centers are an emerging branch\noperating model with a distinctive layout,\nwhere routine transactions are supported\nthrough a combination of technology and\nskilled banker assistance to create\npersonalized experiences. The primary focus of\nthe solution center is to bring a community\nelement to our digital banking capabilities.\nThe solution center provides a collaborative\nenvironment that connects our customers with\nour digital solutions and services, beyond\ndeposits and withdrawals. In 2021, we opened\n13 new solution centers, including in three\nnew markets, Denver, Minneapolis and Phoenix.\nIn total, we have 33 open solution centers\nwithin the markets of Boston, Dallas/Fort\nWorth, Denver, Houston, Kansas City,\nMinneapolis, Nashville and Phoenix. We also\noffer digital unsecured installment and small\nbusiness loans in the expansion markets. As a\nresult of the BBVA acquisition, we have become\na coast-to-coast Retail Bank and added over\n600 branches across seven states to our\nnetwork.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of our\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking and investment products. In\nApril 2021, we announced our Low Cash Mode \u00ae\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae feature which gives all\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae customers the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent\nor address overdrafts, and controls to choose\nwhether to return certain debits rather than\nthe bank making the decision. Through the end\nof December, we have successfully rolled out\nLow Cash Mode \u00ae to all Virtual Wallet \u00ae\ncustomers. Upon conversion, BBVA customers\nbecame eligible for the full suite of PNC\nproducts and services, including Low Cash Mode\n\u00ae .\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result closed 196 branches,\nconsistent with our plan. These branch\nclosures included two solution centers due to\ntheir proximity to pre-existing BBVA USA\nbranch locations.\n\n52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

Results\nfor 2021 reflect the benefit of BBVA's\nbusiness operations since the acquisition\nclosed on June 1, 2021.\n\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to higher average\ndeposit and loan balances reflecting the BBVA\nacquisition and wider interest rate spreads on\nthe value of loans, partially offset by\nnarrower interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits.\n\nGrowth in noninterest income in the comparison\nreflected broad-based increases, including the\nbenefit from BBVA, in capital markets-related\nrevenue, treasury management product revenue\nand revenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities.\n\nProvision recapture in 2021 was driven by\nportfolio changes, including improved credit\nquality and changes in portfolio composition,\nalong with the impact from an improved\neconomic environment, partially offset by the\nadditional provision for credit losses related\nto the BBVA acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense increased in the\ncomparison largely due to higher variable\ncosts associated with increased business\nactivity and the BBVA acquisition.\n\nAverage loans increased compared with 2020 due\nto increases in Real Estate, Commercial\nBanking and Business Credit, partially offset\nby a decline in Corporate Banking:\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing, and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting loans from\nBBVA, partially offset by lower commercial\nmortgage and multifamily agency warehouse\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets-\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business increased primarily driven by\nloans from BBVA, partially offset by lower\naverage utilization of loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased primarily\ndriven by new production and loans from BBVA,\npartially offset by lower average utilization\nof loan commitments.\n\n\u2022 Corporate Banking provides lending,\nequipment finance, treasury management and\ncapital markets-related products and services\nto mid-sized and large corporations and\ngovernment, and not-for-profit entities.\nAverage loans for this business declined\nslightly reflecting lower average utilization\nof loan commitments, mostly offset by loans\nfrom BBVA and new production.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased in the\ncomparison reflecting deposits from BBVA and\ncustomers maintaining liquidity due to the\neconomic impacts of the pandemic. We continue\nto actively monitor the interest rate\nenvironment and make adjustments in response\nto evolving market conditions, bank funding\nneeds and client relationship dynamics.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking continues to\nexpand its Corporate Banking business, focused\non the middle market and larger sectors. We\nexecuted on our expansion plans into the\nSeattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in\n2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated our\nexpansion efforts across the Southwest;\nhowever, this has not changed our strategy\nregarding our de novo expansion efforts. This\nfollows offices opened in Boston and Phoenix\nin 2019, Denver, Houston and Nashville in\n2018, and Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis\nin 2017. These locations complement Corporate\n& Institutional Banking national businesses\nwith a significant presence in these cities,\nand build on past successes in the markets\nwhere PNC\u2019s retail banking presence was\nlimited, such as in the Southeast. Our full\nsuite of commercial products and services is\noffered in these locations.\n                                              \n  Product Revenue                             \n                                              \nIn addition to credit and deposit products for\ncommercial customers, Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking offers other services,\nincluding treasury management, capital\nmarkets-related products and services, and\ncommercial mortgage banking activities, for\ncustomers of all business segments. On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome, corporate service fees and other\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses. The Other\nInformation section in Table 11 includes the\nconsolidated revenue to PNC for these\nservices. A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\n54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nWithin Treasury Management, PNC Global\nTransfers (formerly BBVA Transfer Services,\nInc.) provides wholesale money transfer\nprocessing capabilities between the U.S. and\nMexico and other countries primarily in\nCentral and South America. Treasury management\nrevenue is reported in noninterest income and\nnet interest income. Noninterest income\nincludes treasury management product revenue\nless earnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services. Net interest income\nprimarily includes revenue from all treasury\nmanagement customer deposit balances. Compared\nwith 2020, treasury management revenue\nincreased primarily due to higher noninterest\nincome and higher deposit balances including\nthe impact of the BBVA acquisition, partially\noffset by narrower interest rate spreads on\nthe value of deposits.\n\nCapital markets-related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The increase in capital\nmarkets-related revenue in the comparison was\nmostly driven by higher merger and acquisition\nfees, higher loan syndications and higher\nequity capital market advisory fees. These\nincreases were partially offset by lower fees\nand credit valuations on customer-related\nderivative activities.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income) and revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nrelated hedges. Total revenue from commercial\nmortgage banking activities increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to higher commercial\nmortgage loan servicing income, partially\noffset by lower revenue from commercial\nmortgage loans held for sale.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 55\n                                              \n  Asset

Bank and\nInstitutional Asset Management.\n\nThe PNC Private Bank is focused on being a\npremier private bank in each of the markets it\nserves. The business seeks to deliver high\nquality banking, trust, and investment\nmanagement services to our emerging affluent,\nhigh net worth, and ultra-high net worth\nclients through a broad array of products and\nservices.\n\nInstitutional Asset Management provides\noutsourced chief investment officer, custody,\nprivate real estate, cash and fixed income\nclient solutions, and retirement plan\nfiduciary investment services to institutional\nclients including corporations, healthcare\nsystems, insurance companies, unions,\nmunicipalities, and non-profits.\n\nWith the inclusion of BBVA, PNC Private Bank\nhas approximately 100 offices operating in\nnine out of the ten most affluent states in\nthe U.S. with a majority co-located with\nretail banking branches.\n\nAsset Management Group earnings increased $151\nmillion in 2021 compared with the same period\nin 2020, driven by higher revenue and lower\nprovision for credit losses, partially offset\nby an increase in noninterest expense. Results\nfor 2021 reflect the benefit of BBVA's\nbusiness operations since the acquisition\nclosed on June 1, 2021.\n\nNet interest income increased due to growth in\naverage loan and deposit balances, reflecting\nthe BBVA acquisition and wider interest rate\nspreads on the value of loans. This was\npartially offset by narrower interest rate\nspreads on the value of deposits. The private\nbanking business continues to refine and offer\nbanking products targeted to the emerging\naffluent, the affluent and the ultra-affluent\nclient segments. A key focus of the lending\nbusiness is to drive growth within both the\nresidential real estate product and\nsecurities-based lines of credit product. In\naddition, the deposit strategy focuses on\nliquidity management for optimizing a client\u2019s\noverall portfolio.\n\nThe increase in noninterest income was\nprimarily attributable to increases in the\naverage equity markets and the benefit of\nBBVA.\n\nNoninterest expense increased due to the\nimpact of BBVA operations and higher\noperational loss reserves, partially offset by\nintangible asset amortization run-off.\n\nProvision recapture in 2021 was driven by\nimprovements in credit quality and the\neconomic environment, partially offset by the\nadditional provision for credit losses related\nto the BBVA acquisition.\n\nDiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased in comparison to the prior year\nprimarily attributable to higher equity\nmarkets and the benefit from BBVA as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                              \n   R                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ISK                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n   M                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ANAGEMENT                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n   Enterprise Risk Management                 \n                                              \nWe encounter risk as part of the normal course\nof operating our business. Accordingly, we\ndesign our risk governance framework, referred\nto as the ERM Framework, and risk management\nprocesses to help manage this risk. We manage\nrisk in light of our risk appetite to optimize\nlong-term shareholder value while supporting\nour employees, customers and communities.\n\nOur ERM Framework is structurally aligned with\nregulatory enhanced prudential standards and\nheightened standards, promulgated by the\nFederal Reserve and OCC, respectively, which\nestablish minimum requirements for the design\nand implementation of a risk governance\nframework. This Risk Management section\ndescribes our ERM Framework, which consists of\nseven core components that provide executive\nmanagement and the Board of Directors with an\naggregate view of significant risks impacting\nthe organization. The seven core components\nare risk culture, enterprise strategy\n(including risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing), risk\ngovernance and oversight, risk identification,\nrisk assessments, risk controls and\nmonitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting\n(see the figure below). The overall Risk\nManagement section of this Item 7 also\nprovides an analysis of the firm\u2019s Capital\nManagement and our key areas of risk, which\ninclude, but are not limited to Credit,\nMarket, Liquidity and Operational (including\nCompliance and Information Security). Our use\nof financial derivatives as part of our\noverall asset and liability risk management\nprocess is also addressed within this Risk\nManagement section.\n\nWe operate within a rapidly evolving\nregulatory environment. Accordingly, we are\nactively focused on the timely incorporation\nof applicable regulatory pronouncements into\nour ERM Framework.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 57\n                                              \n  Risk Culture                                \n                                              \nA strong risk culture helps us make well-\ninformed decisions, helps ensure individuals\nconform to the established culture, reduces an\nindividual\u2019s ability to do something for\npersonal gain, and rewards employees for\nworking toward a common goal rather than\nindividual interests. Our risk culture\nreinforces the appropriate protocols for\nresponsible and ethical behavior. These\nprotocols are especially critical in terms of\nour risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and\nrisk management practices.\n\nManaging risk is every employee\u2019s\nresponsibility. All of our employees\nindividually and collectively are responsible\nfor ensuring the organization is performing\nwith the utmost integrity, is applying sound\nrisk management practices and is striving to\nachieve our stated objectives rather than\npursuing individual interests. All employees\nare also responsible for understanding our\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM\nFramework and how risk management applies to\ntheir respective roles and responsibilities.\nEmployees are encouraged to collaborate across\ngroups to identify and mitigate risks and\nelevate issues as required. We reinforce risk\nmanagement responsibilities through a\nperformance management system where employee\nperformance goals include risk management\nobjectives and incentives for employees to\nreinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted\nperformance.\n\nProactive and open communication, between\ngroups and up to the Board of Directors,\nfacilitates timely identification and\nresolution of risk issues. Our multi-level\nrisk committee structure provides formal\nchannels to identify and report risk.\n                                              \n  Enterprise Strategy                         \n                                              \nWe seek to ensure that our overall enterprise\nstrategy is within acceptable risk parameters\nthrough our risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing processes.\nThese components are reviewed and approved at\nleast annually by the Board of Directors.\n\nRisk Appetite : Our risk appetite represents\nthe organization\u2019s desired enterprise risk\nposition, set within our capital-based risk\nand liquidity capacity to achieve our\nstrategic objectives and business plans. The\nEnterprise Risk Appetite Statement\nqualitatively describes the aggregate level of\nrisk we are willing to accept in order to\nexecute our business strategies. Qualitative\nguiding principles further define each of the\nrisks within our taxonomy to support the risk\nappetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and\nlimits, including forward-looking metrics,\nquantitatively measure whether we are\noperating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our\nrisk appetite metrics reflect material risks,\nalign with our established Risk Appetite\nFramework, balance risk and reward, leverage\nanalytics, and are adjusted to changes in the\nexternal and internal risk environments.\n\nStrategic Planning : Our enterprise and line\nof business strategic plans outline major\nobjectives, strategies and goals which are\nexpected to be achieved over the next five\nyears while seeking to ensure we remain\ncompliant with all capital, risk appetite and\nliquidity targets and guidelines. Our chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer\nlead the development of the corporate\nstrategic plan, the strategic objectives and\nthe comprehensive identification of material\nrisks that could hinder successful\nimplementation and execution of strategies.\nStrategic planning is linked to our risk\nmanagement and capital planning processes.\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing : Capital\nplanning helps to ensure we are maintaining\nsafe and sound operations and viability. The\ncapital planning process and the resulting\ncapital plan evolve as our overall risks,\nactivities and risk management practices\nchange. Capital planning aligns with our\nstrategic planning process. Stress testing is\nan essential element of the capital planning\nprocess. Effective stress testing enables us\nto consider the estimated effect on capital of\nvarious hypothetical scenarios.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance and Oversight               \n                                              \nWe employ a comprehensive risk management\ngovernance framework to help ensure that risks\nare identified, balanced decisions are made\nthat consider risk and return, and risks are\nadequately monitored and managed.

Committee composition is\ndesigned to provide effective oversight\nbalanced across the three lines of defense in\naccordance with the OCC\u2019s heightened standards\nand the Federal Reserve Board's enhanced\nprudential standards rules. See the\nSupervision and Regulation section in Item 1\nof this Report for more information.\n\nTo ensure appropriate risks are being taken\nand effectively managed and controlled, risk\nis managed across three lines of defense. The\nBoard of Directors\u2019 and each line of defense\u2019s\nresponsibilities are detailed below:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 The Board of Directors\noversees our risk-taking activities, holds\nmanagement accountable for adhering to the ERM\nFramework and is responsible for exercising\nsound, independent judgment when assessing\nrisk.\n\nFirst line of defense \u2013 The front line units\nare accountable for identifying, owning and\nmanaging risks to within acceptable levels\nwhile adhering to the ERM Framework. Our\nbusinesses strive to enhance risk management\nand internal control processes within their\nareas. Integrated and comprehensive processes\nare designed to adequately manage the\nbusiness\u2019 risk profile and risk appetite\nthrough identifying, assessing, monitoring and\nreporting risks that may significantly impact\neach business.\n\nSecond line of defense \u2013 The second line of\ndefense is independent from the first line of\ndefense and is responsible for establishing\nthe risk governance framework and the\nstandards within each independent risk area\nfor identifying, measuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting aggregate risks. As\nthe second line of defense, the independent\nrisk areas monitor the risks generated by the\nfirst line of defense, review and challenge\nthe implementation of effective risk\nmanagement practices, and report any issues or\nexceptions. The risk areas help to ensure\nprocesses and controls owned by the businesses\nare designed and operating as intended, and\nthey may intervene directly to modify and\ndevelop first line of defense risk processes\nand controls .\n\nThird line of defense \u2013 As the third line of\ndefense, Internal Audit is independent from\nthe first and second lines of defense.\nInternal Audit provides the Board of Directors\nand executive management comprehensive\nassurance on the effectiveness of the ERM\nFramework and the risk management practices\nacross the organization.\n\nWithin the three lines of defense, the\nindependent risk organization has sufficient\nauthority to influence material decisions. Our\nbusiness oversight and decision-making is\nsupported through a governance structure at\nthe Board of Directors and management level.\nSpecific responsibilities include:\n\nBoard of Directors \u2013 Our Board of Directors\noversees our business and affairs as managed\nby our officers and employees. The Board of\nDirectors may receive assistance in carrying\nout its duties and may delegate authority\nthrough the following standing committees:\n\n\u2022 Audit Committee : monitors the integrity of\nour consolidated financial statements;\nmonitors internal control over financial\nreporting; monitors compliance with our code\nof ethics; evaluates and monitors the\nqualifications and independence of our\nindependent auditors; and evaluates and\nmonitors the performance of our Internal Audit\nfunction and our independent auditors.\n\n\u2022 Nominating and Governance Committee :\noversees the implementation of sound corporate\ngovernance principles and practices while\npromoting our best interests and those of our\nshareholders.\n\n\u2022 Human Resources Committee : oversees the\ncompensation of our executive officers and\nother specified responsibilities related to\ntalent and human capital matters affecting us.\nThe committee is also responsible for\nevaluating the relationship between risk-\ntaking activities and incentive compensation\nplans.\n\n\u2022 Risk Committee : oversees our enterprise-\nwide risk structure and the processes\nestablished to identify, measure, monitor and\nmanage the organization\u2019s risks and evaluates\nand approves our risk governance framework.\nThe Risk Committee has formed a Technology\nSubcommittee and a Compliance Subcommittee to\nfacilitate Board-level oversight of risk\nmanagement in these areas.\n\n\u2022 Special Committee on Equity & Inclusion:\noversees management\u2019s equity and inclusion\nefforts, internally and externally, focusing\non our systemic processes (including for\nemployees and suppliers); low and moderate\nincome communities (including community\ndevelopment banking, and product offerings and\nfinancial support for such communities); and\nadvocacy (including partnerships with leading\norganizations, and advocacy for necessary\nstructural changes to help provide greater\naccess to the banking system and end systemic\nracism).\n\nManagement Level Executive Committee \u2013 The\nManagement Level Executive Committee is\nresponsible for guiding the creation and\nexecution of our business strategy across the\ncompany. With this responsibility, the\nManagement Level Executive Committee executes\nvarious strategic approval and review\nactivities, with a focus on capital\ndeployment, business performance and risk\nmanagement. This Committee also helps ensure\nPNC is staffed with sufficient resources and\ntalent to operate within its risk appetite.\n\nCorporate Committees \u2013 The Corporate\nCommittees generally operate based on the\ndelegated approval authority from a Board-\nlevel Committee, the Management Level\nExecutive Committee or other Corporate\nCommittees. These Committees operate at the\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 59\nsenior management level and are designed to\nfacilitate the review, evaluation, oversight\nand approval of key business and risk\nactivities.\n\nWorking Committees \u2013 The Working Committees\ngenerally operate on delegated approval\nauthority from a Corporate Committee or other\nWorking Committees. Working Committees are\nintended to provide oversight of\nregulatory/legal matters, assist in the\nimplementation of key enterprise-level\nactivities within a business or function and\nsupport the oversight of the businesses key\nrisk activities.\n\nTransactional Committees \u2013 Transactional\nCommittees generally operate based on\ndelegated approval authority from a Corporate\nor Working Committee to approve individual\ntransactions, transactional related activities\nor movements on the organization's balance\nsheet.\n\nPolicies and Procedures \u2013 We have established\nrisk management Policies and Procedures to\nsupport our ERM Framework, articulate our risk\nculture, define the parameters and processes\nwithin which employees are to manage risk and\nconduct our business activities and to provide\ndirection, guidance and clarity on roles and\nresponsibilities to management and the Board\nof Directors. These Policies and Procedures\nare organized in a multi-tiered framework and\nrequire periodic review and approval by\nrelevant Committees, including where\nappropriate Committees of the Board of\nDirectors, or management.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nRisk identification takes place across a\nvariety of risk types throughout the\norganization. These risk types include, but\nare not limited to, credit, liquidity and\ncapital, market and operational (which\nincludes, among other types of risk,\ncompliance and information security). Risks\nare identified based on a balanced use of\nanalytical tools and management judgment for\nboth on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our\ngovernance structure supports risk\nidentification by facilitating assessment of\nkey risk issues, emerging risks and\nidiosyncratic risks and implementation of\nmitigation strategies as appropriate. These\nrisks are prioritized based on quantitative\nand qualitative analysis and assessed against\nour risk appetite. Multiple tools and\napproaches are used to help identify and\nprioritize risks, including Risk Appetite\nMetrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance\nIndicators, Risk and Control Self-Assessments,\nscenario analysis, stress testing and special\ninvestigations.\n\nRisks are aggregated and assessed within and\nacross risk functions and businesses. The\naggregated risk information is reviewed and\nreported at an enterprise level to the Board\nof Directors or appropriate committees. This\nenterprise aggregation and reporting approach\npromotes the identification and appropriate\nescalation of material risks across the\norganization and supports an understanding of\nthe cumulative impact of risk in relation to\nour risk appetite.\n                                              \n  Risk Assessment                             \n                                              \nOnce risks are identified, they are evaluated\nbased on quantitative and qualitative analysis\nto determine whether they are material. Risk\nassessments support the overall management of\nan effective ERM Framework and allow us to\ncontrol and monitor our actual risk level and\nrisk management effectiveness through the use\nof risk measures. Comprehensive, accurate and\ntimely assessments of risk are essential to an\neffective ERM Framework. Effective risk\nmeasurement practices are designed to uncover\nrecurring risks that have been experienced in\nthe past; facilitate the monitoring,\nunderstanding, analysis and reporting of known\nrisks; and reveal unanticipated risks that may\nnot be easy to understand or predict.\n                                              \n   Risk Controls and Monitoring               \n                                              \nOur ERM Framework consists of policies,\nprocesses, personnel and control systems. Risk\ncontrols and limits provide the linkage from\nour Risk Appetite Statement and associated\nguiding principles to the risk-taking\nactivities of our businesses. In addition to\nrisk appetite limits, a system of more\ndetailed internal controls exists which\noversees and monitors our various processes\nand functions. These control systems measure\nperformance, help employees make correct\ndecisions, help ensure information is accurate\nand reliable and facilitate compliance with\nlaws and regulations.\n\nWe design our monitoring and evaluation of\nrisks and controls to provide assurance that\npolicies, procedures and controls are\neffective and also to result in the\nidentification of control improvement\nrecommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily,\nongoing process used by both the first and\nsecond line of defense to help ensure\ncompliance with our ERM Framework. Risk\nmonitoring is accomplished in many ways,\nincluding performing risk assessments at the\nprime process and risk assessment unit level,\nmonitoring an area\u2019s key controls, the timely\nreporting of issues, and establishing a\nquality control and/or quality assurance\nfunction, as applicable.\n                                              \n  Risk Aggregation and Reporting              \n                                              \nRisk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i)\naggregate risks; (ii) identify concentrations;\n(iii) help ensure we remain within our\nestablished risk appetite; (iv) monitor our\nrisk profile in relation to our risk appetite\nand (v) communicate risks and views on the\neffectiveness of our risk management\nactivities to the Board of Directors and\nexecutive management.\n\nRisk reports are produced at the line of\nbusiness, functional risk and enterprise\nlevels. The enterprise level risk report\naggregates material risks identified in the\nrisk area reports and in the business reports\nto define the enterprise risk profile. The\nenterprise risk profile is a point-in-time\nassessment of enterprise risk and represents\nour overall risk position in relation to the\ndesired enterprise risk\n\n60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nappetite. The determination of the enterprise\nrisk profile is based on analysis of\nquantitative reporting of risk limits and\nother measures along with qualitative\nassessments. Quarterly aggregation of risk\nreports from the risk areas and lines of\nbusiness to inform our risk profile is\ndesigned to provide a clear view of our risk\nlevel relative to our quantitative risk\nappetite. The enterprise level report is\nprovided through the governance structure to\nthe Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nEach individual risk report includes an\nassessment of inherent risk, quality of risk\nmanagement, residual risk, risk appetite and\nrisk outlook. The enterprise level risk report\nincludes an aggregate view of material risks\nidentified in the individual reports and\nprovides a summary of our overall risk profile\ncompared to our risk appetite.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk Management                      \n                                              \nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with the contractual\nterms of their loan, extension of credit or\nother financial obligation with PNC. Credit\nrisk is inherent in the financial services\nbusiness and results from extending credit to\ncustomers, purchasing securities, and entering\ninto financial derivative transactions and\ncertain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is\none of our most significant risks. Our\nprocesses for managing credit risk are\ndesigned to be embedded in our risk culture\nand in our decision-making processes using a\nsystematic approach whereby credit risks and\nrelated exposures are identified and assessed,\nmanaged through specific policies and\nprocesses, measured and evaluated against our\nrisk appetite and credit concentration limits,\nand reported, along with specific mitigation\nactivities, to management and the Board of\nDirectors through our governance structure.\nOur most significant concentration of credit\nrisk is in our loan portfolio.\n\nCredit Risk Management employs a governance,\npolicy and monitoring framework for\nenvironmental and social risk topics that\nincludes periodic updates to PNC\u2019s Credit\nPortfolio Strategy Committee. Outcomes from\nthose updates may be incorporated into credit\npolicies and risk procedures that govern our\nrisk appetite, credit decisioning, portfolio\nmanagement and reserve processes.\n\nCredit Risk Management is currently evaluating\nhow it may best understand the impacts to\ncredit risk that may accelerate or be\nintroduced as a result of climate change,\nincluding impacts from physical risk events\nand risks associated with the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy. These risk events may\nimpact a borrower\u2019s income, cash flow or\ncollateral due to frequency or severity of\nweather events, changing market conditions,\nconsumer preferences and demand for products,\nor changes to the legislative and regulatory\nlandscape. As disruptive events occur, PNC\nfollows a process to determine if enhanced\nportfolio monitoring, reporting and executive\ncommunication is warranted to ensure\nappropriate oversight and action.\n\nIn commercial lending, PNC limits new\noriginations in sectors that are no longer\nconsistent with our strategic direction, such\nas mountain-top removal coal mining, Arctic\noil and gas and private prisons. Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking transactions are subject\nto an Environmental and Social Risk Management\nassessment designed to help us better identify\nand mitigate environmental, human rights and\nother social risks early in the credit\napplication process. Transactions identified\nas having a potential environmental, human\nrights or other social risk are evaluated to\ndetermine whether enhanced due diligence is\nwarranted. In consumer lending, PNC strives to\nensure adequate insurance is present for\nproperties exposed to flooding while also\nmonitoring other water-related risks such as\nthe increased shoreline (and coastal) erosion\nand weather related events such as hurricanes\nand wildfires.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 61\n                                              \n  Loan Portfolio Characteristics and          \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 13: Details of Loans                  \n                                              \nIn billions\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators, as\nfurther detailed in Note 4 Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Report, to monitor and measure\nour exposure to credit risk within our loan\nportfolio. The following provides additional\ninformation about the significant loan classes\nthat comprise our Commercial and Consumer\nportfolio segments.\n\nCommercial\n\nC ommercial and Industrial\n\nCommercial and industrial loans comprised 53%\nand 55% of our total loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The\nmajority of our commercial and industrial\nloans are secured by collateral that provides\na secondary source of repayment for the loan\nshould the borrower experience cash generation\ndifficulties. Examples of this collateral\ninclude short-term assets, such as accounts\nreceivable, inventory and securities, and\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-\noccupied real estate and other business\nassets.\n\nWe actively manage our commercial and\nindustrial loans to assess any changes (both\npositive and negative) in the level of credit\nrisk at both the borrower and portfolio level.\nTo evaluate the level of credit risk, we\nassign internal risk ratings reflecting our\nestimates of the borrower\u2019s PD and LGD for\neach related credit facility. This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geography that may exist in our portfolio.\nOur commercial and industrial portfolio is\nwell-diversified as shown in the following\ntable which provides a breakout by industry\nclassification (classified based on the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System).\n\nTable 14: Commercial and Industrial Loans by\nIndustry\n                                              \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026    $  22\u2026     15  %    $  20\u2026     15  %  \n  t\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026       22\u2026     15          20\u2026     16     \n  S\u2026       20\u2026     14          19\u2026     15     \n  p\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026       17\u2026     12          14\u2026     11     \n  s\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026       15\u2026     10          13\u2026     10     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       10\u2026      7          7,\u2026      5     \n  &                                           \n  t\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       9,\u2026      7          8,\u2026      7     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       7,\u2026      5          7,\u2026      5     \n  w\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       26\u2026     15          20\u2026     16     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $  15\u2026    100  %    $  13\u2026    100  %  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real\nestate and construction industries.\n\n62 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nThe increase in commercial and industrial\nloans compared to December 31, 2020, primarily\nreflects the acquisition of BBVA along with\norganic loan growth in the PNC legacy\nportfolio, partially offset by PPP loan\nforgiveness.

Included in\nour outstanding loan balances are $0.9 billion\nof loans that are funded through the PPP and\nguaranteed by the Small Business\nAdministration. We continue to carefully\nmonitor and manage the loans in these\nindustries, and we believe uncertainty\nrelative to the timing and level of long-term\nrecovery for leisure recreation and leisure\ntravel remains high.\n\nAs the impact from COVID-19 persists, real\nestate related to the office sector is an area\nof growing uncertainty. Notable portions of\nleased office space remain vacant and the mass\nwork-from-home experience continues to be a\nfeasible alternative, suggesting a structural\nchange for office demand moving forward.\nHowever, the change is anticipated to be slow\nmoving and could evolve over a number of\nyears. PNC continues to closely monitor our\nexposure in the office sector as these\nconcerns develop, and while internal risk\nassessments have moved moderately higher, we\nhave not seen a notable change in performance.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding FICO scores and LTVs, and we update\nthese and other credit metrics at least\nquarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming, conforming). This\ninformation is used for internal reporting and\nrisk management. As part of our overall risk\nanalysis and monitoring, we also segment the\nportfolio based upon loan delinquency,\nnonperforming status, modification and\nbankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and\ngeographic concentrations. Loan performance is\nevaluated by source originators and loan\nservicers.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our residential real\nestate portfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 16: Residential Real Estate           \n  Statistics                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  15\u2026    38    %    $  7\u2026     35   %  \n  \u2026       4,\u2026    11            4\u2026      2      \n  \u2026       3,\u2026     8            1\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      7      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     4            1\u2026      1      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            2\u2026      1      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     3            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       957     2            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       7,\u2026    19            6\u2026     27      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  39\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  775                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              67    %              67   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at December 31, 2021.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans\nnationwide through our national mortgage\nbusiness as well as within our branch network.\nResidential mortgage loans underwritten to\nagency standards, including conforming loan\namount limits, are typically sold with\nservicing retained by us.

Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 17: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5,\u2026    21    %    $  5\u2026     23   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    13            3\u2026     14      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026    10            2\u2026     11      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     7            1\u2026      6      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      6      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      6      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      6      \n  \u2026       978     4             7             \n  \u2026       918     4            1\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       777     3            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       5,\u2026    23            4\u2026     20      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  24\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              62    %              63   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              38                   37      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  782                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              66    %              67   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at December 31, 2021.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $15.4 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.2 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of December 31,\n2021.

2021 balance of\nnonperforming assets attributable to BBVA.\nChanges in this acquired portfolio for the six\nmonths ended December 31, 2021 are reflected\nin the appropriate category based on activity.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of\ntotal nonperforming loans were secured by\ncollateral which lessened reserve requirements\nand is expected to reduce credit losses.\n\nWithin consumer nonperforming loans,\nresidential real estate TDRs comprised 42% of\ntotal residential real estate nonperforming\nloans, while home equity TDRs comprised 36% of\nhome equity nonperforming loans at December\n31, 2021. Comparable amounts at December 31,\n2020 were 47% and 41%, respectively. TDRs\ngenerally remain in nonperforming status until\na borrower has made at least six consecutive\nmonths of both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms or ultimate\nresolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus and loans to borrowers not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Loans that have\nbeen restructured for COVID-19 related\nhardships and meet certain criteria under the\nCARES Act are not identified as TDRs. Refer to\nthe Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications discussion in this Credit Risk\nManagement section for more information on the\ntreatment of loan modifications under the\nCARES Act.\n\nLoan Delinquencies\n\nWe regularly monitor the level of loan\ndelinquencies and believe these levels may be\na key indicator of credit quality in our loan\nportfolio. Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower, repayment sources,\nunderlying collateral, and other support given\ncurrent events, economic conditions and\nexpectations. We refine our practices to meet\nthe changing environment and the continuing\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate\nlosses and enhance customer support, we have\ncustomer assistance, loan modification and\ncollection programs that align with the CARES\nAct and subsequent interagency guidance.\n\nAs a result, under the CARES Act credit\nreporting rules, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020 based on the contractual terms of the\nloan, even where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period. Loan modifications due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships that permanently\nreduce either the contractual interest rate or\nthe principal balance of a loan do not qualify\nfor TDR relief under the CARES Act or the\ninteragency guidance.\n\nTable 21: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed loans of $0.5 billion\nand $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\n\nThe increase in accruing loans past due from\nDecember 31, 2020 was the result of lower\ndelinquencies in the PNC legacy portfolio\nbeing more than offset by delinquencies\nattributable to BBVA, including increases from\nBBVA conversion-related administrative and\noperational delays.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 67\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\ncontinue to accrue interest because they are\n(i) well secured by collateral and are in the\nprocess of collection, (ii) managed in\nhomogeneous portfolios with specified charge-\noff timeframes adhering to regulatory\nguidelines, or (iii) certain government\ninsured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that have been\nrestructured but that meet certain criteria\nunder the CARES Act are not categorized as\nTDRs at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\ntroubled debt restructurings at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively:\n\nTable 22: Summary of Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (a)\n                                              \n              D\u2026           D\u2026                 \n              31           31                 \n              2\u2026           2\u2026       C\u2026        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $            %                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  6\u2026        $  5\u2026        $  1\u2026    2\u2026  \n  \u2026       9\u2026           1\u2026           -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  1\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  9\u2026        $  9\u2026        $  86    1\u2026  \n  \u2026       6\u2026           7\u2026           -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  1\u2026        $  -\u2026    (\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table do not include associated\nvaluation allowances.\n\n(b) Accruing loans include consumer credit\ncard loans and certain loans that have\ndemonstrated a period of at least six months\nof performance under the restructured terms\nand are excluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nNonperforming TDRs represented approximately\n40% of total nonperforming loans and 62% of\ntotal TDRs at December 31, 2021.

Throughout 2021, consumer\nloan modifications were being granted in\nresponse to customer hardships that extended\nbeyond the initial relief programs and\nincluded all hardship related modifications.\nAt December 31, 2021, consumer loans in active\nassistance under hardship relief programs on\nour balance sheet had an unpaid principal\nbalance of $494 million and primarily related\nto residential real estate. Excluded from this\namount are government insured or guaranteed\nloans of $205 million and $278 million in the\nResidential real estate and Education loan\nclasses, respectively, as these loans present\nminimal credit risk to PNC. The comparable\nunpaid principal balance on our balance sheet\nat December 31, 2020 was $1.0 billion.\n\nUnder the CARES Act, loan modifications\nmeeting certain criteria qualify the loan for\nrelief from TDR treatment. Loans that do not\nmeet this criteria may also be evaluated under\ninteragency guidance. Loan modifications that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate and/or principal balance of the\nloan would not meet the qualifications for\nrelief from TDR treatment under the CARES Act.\nConsumer loan modifications that qualified for\nTDR accounting amounted to $93 million and\n$149 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nThe impact of these modifications was\nconsidered within the quarterly reserve\ndetermination. See the Allowance for Credit\nLosses discussion within the Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments section of\nthis Report for additional information.

We maintain the ACL at\nan appropriate level for expected losses on\nour existing investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, trade receivables\nand other financial assets and off-balance\nsheet credit exposures and determine this\nallowance based on quarterly assessments of\nthe remaining estimated contractual term of\nthe assets or exposures as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nExpected losses are estimated primarily using\na combination of (i) the expected losses over\na reasonable and supportable forecast period,\n(ii) a period of reversion to long run average\nexpected losses where applicable and (iii)\nlong run average expected losses for the\nremaining estimated contractual term.\n\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we have established a\nframework which includes a three year forecast\nperiod and the use of four economic scenarios\nand associated probability weights, which in\ncombination create a forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes over the forecasted period.\nForward looking information, such as\nforecasted relevant macroeconomic variables,\nis incorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates using quantitative macroeconomic\nmodels, as well as through analysis from PNC\u2019s\neconomists and management\u2019s judgment in\nqualitatively assessing the ACL.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long run average expected\ncredit losses. We may consider a number of\nfactors in determining the duration of the\nreversion period, such as contractual maturity\nof the asset, observed historical patterns and\nthe estimated credit loss rates at the end of\nthe forecast period relative to the beginning\nof the long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long run average expected credit losses\nare derived from our available historical\ncredit information. We use long run average\nexpected loss for the portfolio over the\nestimated remaining contractual term beyond\nour forecast period and the reversion period.\n\nThe following discussion provides additional\ninformation related to our reserves under CECL\nfor loans and leases as well as unfunded\nlending related commitments. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for further discussion on our ACL,\nincluding details of our methodologies and\ndiscussion of the allowances for investment\nsecurities and other financial assets. See\nalso the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section for further discussion of\nthe assumptions used in the determination of\nthe ACL.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is\nbased upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD\nand the remaining estimated contractual term\nfor a loan or loan segment. We also consider\nthe impact of prepayments and amortization on\ncontractual maturity in our expected loss\nestimates. We use historical data, current\nborrower characteristics and forecasted\neconomic variables in quantitative methods to\nestimate these risk parameters by loan or loan\nsegments. PDs represent a quantification of\nrisk that a borrower may not be able to pay\ntheir contractual obligation over a defined\nperiod of time. LGD describes the estimate of\npotential loss if a borrower were to default,\nand EAD (or utilization rates for revolving\nloans) is the estimated balance outstanding at\nthe time of default. These parameters are\ncalculated for each forecasted scenario, and\nare combined to generate expected loss\nestimates by scenario in proportion to the\nscenario weights.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology for\nour consumer real estate related loan classes\nand for certain commercial and consumer TDR\nloans. For non-TDR residential real estate\nloans and lines, we determine effective\ninterest rates considering contractual cash\nflows adjusted for prepayments and market\ninterest rates. We then determine the net\npresent value of expected cash flows and ALLL\nby discounting contractual cash flows adjusted\nfor both prepayments and expected credit\nlosses using the effective interest rates.\n\nFor loans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans, we\nestablish individually assessed reserves using\nmethods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for\nindividual commercial nonperforming loans and\ncommercial TDRs exceeding a defined dollar\nthreshold are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Commercial\nloans that are below the defined threshold and\naccruing TDRs are collectively reserved for,\nas we believe these loans continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. For consumer\nnonperforming loans classified as collateral\ndependent, charge-off and ALLL related to\nrecovery of amounts previously charged-off are\nevaluated through an analysis of the fair\nvalue of the collateral less costs to sell.\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 69\nnot limited to, potential imprecision in the\nestimation process due to the inherent time\nlag of obtaining information and normal\nvariations between expected and actual\noutcomes. We may hold additional reserves that\nare designed to provide coverage for losses\nattributable to such risks. A portion of the\nallowance is related to qualitative\nmeasurement factors. These factors may\ninclude, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\nincluding the impacts of COVID-19 on highly\nimpacted segments,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends, including the\nimpact of COVID-19 hardship related loan\nmodifications,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures, and\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information, including\nthe performance of first lien positions.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable, ( e.g., unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees) at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. The allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments is recorded as a\nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNet adjustments to this reserve are included\nin the provision for credit losses.\n\nThe following table summarizes our ACL related\nto loans:\n\nTable 23: Allowance for Credit Losses by Loan\nClass (a)\n                                              \n

The second is the potential\ninability to operate our businesses because\nadequate contingent liquidity is not\navailable. We manage liquidity risk at the\nconsolidated company level (bank, parent\ncompany and all subsidiaries combined) to help\nensure that we can obtain cost-effective\nfunding to meet current and future obligations\nunder both normal \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and\nstressful circumstances, and to help ensure\nthat we maintain an appropriate level of\ncontingent liquidity.\n\nManagement monitors liquidity through a series\nof early warning indicators that may indicate\na potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity\nstress event. In addition, management performs\na set of liquidity stress tests over multiple\ntime horizons with varying levels of severity\nand maintains a contingency funding plan to\naddress a potential liquidity stress event. In\nthe most severe liquidity stress simulation,\nwe assume that our liquidity position is under\npressure, while the market in general is under\nsystemic pressure. The simulation considers,\namong other things, the impact of restricted\naccess to both secured and unsecured external\nsources of funding, accelerated runoff of\ncustomer deposits, valuation pressure on\nassets and heavy demand to fund committed\nobligations.

The\nFederal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed\nas a primary means of funding our routine\nbusiness activities, but rather as a potential\nsource of liquidity in a stressed environment\nor during a market disruption. At December 31,\n2021, our unused secured borrowing capacity at\nthe FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled\n$78.8 billion.\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. As of December 31, 2021,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing senior\nunsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $9.0 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is held in intercompany cash\nand investments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends it receives from\nPNC Bank, which may be impacted by the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was approximately $2.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021. See Note 20 Regulatory\nMatters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report for a\nfurther discussion of these limitations.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 73\nOn October 14, 2021, following completion of\nthe bank merger on October 8, 2021, PNC Bank\ncompleted a return of capital of $3.0 billion\nto the parent company.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper.

The rating action was driven by a change\nin Moody\u2019s rating methodology and no impact to\nPNC or its businesses is expected as a result\nof this downgrade. PNC Bank\u2019s senior unsecured\nand subordinated debt ratings were affirmed at\nA2 and A3, respectively. At the same time, the\nMoody\u2019s rating outlook on PNC Bank\u2019s long-term\ndeposit, senior unsecured debt and issuer\nratings were raised from negative to stable.\n                                              \n  Capital Management                          \n                                              \nWe manage our funding and capital positions by\nmaking adjustments to our balance sheet size\nand composition, issuing or redeeming debt,\nissuing equity or other capital instruments,\nexecuting treasury stock transactions and\ncapital redemptions or repurchases and\nmanaging dividend policies and retaining\nearnings.\n\nOn September 13, 2021, PNC issued 1,500,000\ndepositary shares each representing 1/100th\nownership in a share of 3.400% fixed-rate\nreset non-cumulative perpetual preferred\nstock, Series T, with a par value of $1 per\nshare.\n\nIn 2021, we returned $3.0 billion of capital\nto shareholders through dividends on common\nshares of $2.0 billion and repurchases of 5\nmillion common shares for $1.0 billion.\n\nWe repurchase shares of PNC common stock under\na share repurchase authorization provided by\nour Board of Directors in the amount of up to\n100 million shares. Our repurchases are made\non the open market or in privately negotiated\ntransactions and the extent and timing of\nshare repurchases under authorizations depend\non a number of factors including, among\nothers, market and general economic\nconditions, economic and regulatory capital\nconsiderations, alternative uses of capital,\nthe potential impact on our credit ratings,\ncontractual and regulatory limitations, and\nthe results of supervisory assessments of\ncapital adequacy and capital planning\nprocesses undertaken by the Federal Reserve\nand the OCC as part of the CCAR and DFAST\nprocesses. Repurchases of common stock are\nsubject to regulatory requirements, including\ncompliance with SCB requirements.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Federal\nReserve extended the special limitations on\ndividends and share repurchases by CCAR-\nparticipating BHCs that were put in place in\n2020 as a result of ongoing uncertainty from\nCOVID-19. While these restrictions permitted\nshare repurchases based on income, we\nrefrained from repurchasing shares until the\nclose of the BBVA transaction. These\nrestrictions ended on June 30, 2021 for firms\nwith capital levels above those required by\nthe 2021 stress tests, such as PNC. In June\n2021, we announced the reinstatement of our\nshare repurchase programs with repurchases of\nup to $2.9 billion for the four-quarter period\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn January 5, 2022, the PNC Board of Directors\ndeclared a quarterly cash dividend on common\nstock of $1.25 per share paid on February 5,\n2022.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n

effective for PNC. The most\nsignificant changes involved PNC\u2019s election to\n\nexclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital\nand higher thresholds used to calculate CET1\ncapital deductions. As a result, PNC deducts\nfrom CET1 capital investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs\nand deferred tax assets (in each case, net of\nassociated deferred tax liabilities) to the\nextent such items individually exceed 25% of\nits adjusted CET1 capital.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\n\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date compared to the CECL ACL at\ntransition. The estimated CECL impact was\nadded to CET1 capital through December 31,\n2021, and will be phased-out over the\nfollowing three years. PNC elected to adopt\nthis optional transition provision effective\nas of March 31, 2020. See additional\ndiscussion of this rule in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of this Report.\n\n76 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nAt December 31, 2021, PNC and PNC Bank, our\nsole bank subsidiary, were both considered\n\u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based on applicable U.S.\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. To\nqualify as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, PNC must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6% for\nTier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total\nrisk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have\nBasel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for\nCET1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-\nbased capital, 10% for Total risk-based\ncapital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our December 31,\n2021 capital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management                     \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk of a loss in earnings\nor economic value due to adverse movements in\nmarket factors such as interest rates, credit\nspreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity\nprices and equity prices. We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily by our involvement in\nthe following activities, among others:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans,\n\n\u2022 Equity and other investments and activities\nwhose economic values are directly impacted by\nmarket factors, and\n\n\u2022 Fixed income securities, derivatives and\nforeign exchange activities, as a result of\ncustomer activities and securities\nunderwriting.\n\nWe have established enterprise-wide policies\nand methodologies to identify, measure,\nmonitor and report market risk. Market Risk\nManagement provides independent oversight by\nmonitoring compliance with established\nguidelines and reporting significant risks in\nthe business to the Risk Committee of the\nBoard of Directors.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans. Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our risk management policies,\nwhich are approved by management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2021 and\n2020 follow:\n                                              \n   Table 32: Interest Sensitivity Analysis    \n                                              \n                                              \n                  Fourth            Fourth    \n                  Quarter           Quarter   \n                  2021              2020      \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  (a)                                         \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis      3.7  %            4.7  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis      9.9  %           12.5  %         \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n                                              \n(a) Given the inherent limitations in certain\nof these measurement tools and techniques,\nresults become less meaningful as interest\nrates approach zero.

We believe\nthat we have the deposit funding base and\nbalance sheet flexibility to adjust, where\nappropriate and permissible, to changing\ninterest rates and market conditions.\n\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, the\nscheduled discontinuance of the requirement\nthat banks submit rates for the calculation of\nLIBOR after June 30, 2023 presents risks to\nthe financial instruments originated, held or\nserviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference\nrate. PNC holds instruments and services its\ninstruments and instruments owned by others\nthat may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC, like other\nfinancial participants, to financial, legal,\noperational, and reputational risks.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, PNC has established a cross-\nfunctional governance structure to oversee the\noverall strategy for the transition from LIBOR\nand mitigate risks associated with the\ntransition. A LIBOR impact and risk assessment\nhas been performed, which identified the\nassociated risks across products, systems,\nmodels, and processes. PNC also established an\nenterprise-level program, which is actively\nmonitoring PNC\u2019s overall firm-wide exposure to\nLIBOR and using these results to plan\ntransitional strategies and track progress\nversus these goals. Program workstreams were\nformed by Line of Business to ensure\naccountability and alignment with the\nappropriate operational, technology, and\ncustomer-facing stakeholders, while\nestablishing a centralized Program Management\nOffice to ensure consistency in execution and\ncommunication. Project plans and established\nmilestones have been developed and have\ncontinued to evolve and be refined in line\nwith industry developments and internal\ndecisions and progress. PNC is also involved\nin industry discussions, preparing milestones\nfor readiness and assessing progress against\nthose milestones, along with developing and\ndelivering on internal and external LIBOR\ncessation communication plans.\n\nKey efforts to date have included:\n\n\u2022 Enhancing fallback language in new contracts\nand reviewing existing legal\ncontracts/agreements to assess fallback\nlanguage impacts,\n\n\u2022 Making preparations for internal operational\nreadiness,\n\n\u2022 Making necessary enhancements to PNC's\ninfrastructure, including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes,\n\n78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n\u2022 Developing and delivering on internal and\nexternal LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n\n\u2022 Engaging with PNC clients, industry working\ngroups and regulators,\n\n\u2022 Monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments,\n\n\u2022 Incorporating BBVA into PNC\u2019s LIBOR\ntransition effort, and\n\n\u2022 Initiating the offering of instruments\nreferencing alternative rates in order to\nalign with regulatory guidance encouraging the\ntransition away from the use of USD LIBOR in\nnew contracts after December 31, 2021.\n\nPNC also was an active participant in efforts\nwith the Federal Reserve and other regulatory\nagencies to explore the potential need for a\ncredit-sensitive rate or add-on to SOFR for\nuse in commercial loans. Those efforts led to\nthe formation of the Credit Sensitivity Group,\nwhich held a series of workshops to assess how\na credit-sensitive rate or add-on to SOFR\nmight be constructed and discuss associated\nimplementation issues.\n\nPNC began offering conforming adjustable rate\nmortgages using SOFR instead of USD LIBOR, in\nline with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nrequirements, and nonconforming adjustable\nrate residential mortgages using SOFR and\nprivate student loans using Prime. Alternative\nrates including, but not limited to, the BSBY\nIndex and SOFR are currently being offered to\nour corporate and commercial customers. The\nmajority of PNC\u2019s LIBOR exposure maturing\nafter June 30, 2023 is represented by\napproximately $100 billion in loans\noutstanding, most of which reside in Corporate\n& Institutional Banking, and approximately\n$370 billion in derivatives, most of which\ninclude language defining the new rate upon\ncessation. The focus for 2022 will be planning\nfor the cessation event in 2023 for all lines\nof business. Corporate & Institutional Banking\nwill also be amending contracts with\ninadequate fallback language, working on\nsystems enhancements and continuing with\nclient outreach and education. PNC has\nprovided regular updates to Federal Reserve,\nOCC and FDIC examination staff regarding its\nLIBOR cessation and transition plans.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities. These transactions,\nrelated hedges and the credit valuation\nadjustment related to our customer derivatives\nportfolio are marked-to-market daily and\nreported as customer-related trading\nactivities. We do not engage in proprietary\ntrading of these products.\n\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and\nmonitor market risk in customer-related\ntrading activities. VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on\nthe statistical analysis of historical market\nrisk factors. A diversified VaR reflects\nempirical correlations across different asset\nclasses. We calculate a diversified VaR at a\n95% confidence interval and the results for\n2021 and 2020 were within our acceptable\nlimits.\n\nTo help ensure the integrity of the models\nused to calculate VaR for each portfolio and\nenterprise-wide, we use a process known as\nbacktesting. The backtesting process consists\nof comparing actual observations of gains or\nlosses against the VaR levels that were\ncalculated at the close of the prior day. Our\nVaR measure assumes that exposures remain\nconstant and that recent market variability is\na good predictor of future variability. Actual\nobservations include customer-related revenue\nand intraday hedging which helps to reduce\nlosses and can reduce the number of instances\nactual losses exceed the prior day VaR\nmeasure. There were no instances during 2021\nand minimal instances during 2020 under our\ndiversified VaR measure where actual losses\nexceeded the prior day VaR measure and those\nlosses were insignificant. Our portfolio and\nenterprise-wide VaR models utilize a\nhistorical approach with a 500 day look back\nperiod.\n\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $372\nmillion in 2021 compared with $466 million in\n2020 and is recorded in Other noninterest\nincome and Other interest income on our\nConsolidated Income Statement. The decrease\nwas primarily due to the impact of the changes\nin credit valuations for customer-related\nderivative activities and lower client-related\nderivatives sales revenues, partially offset\nby higher foreign exchange client sales\nrevenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

These tax\ncredit investment balances included unfunded\ncommitments totaling $2.2 billion and $1.4\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. These unfunded commitments are\nincluded in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNote 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and\nVariable Interest Entities in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report has further information on tax\ncredit investments.\n\nPrivate Equity and Other\n\nThe largest component of our other equity\ninvestments is our private equity portfolio.\nThe private equity portfolio is an illiquid\nportfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity\ninvestments that vary by industry, stage and\ntype of investment. Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.8\nbillion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively. As of December 31,\n2021, $1.7 billion was invested directly in a\nvariety of companies and $0.1 billion was\ninvested indirectly through various private\nequity funds. See the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report\nfor discussion of the potential impacts of the\nVolcker Rule on our interests in and\nrelationships with private funds covered by\nthe Volcker Rule.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the December 31, 2021\nper share closing price of $216.71 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.2 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements. The estimated\nvalue does not represent fair value of the\nVisa B common shares given the shares\u2019 limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $50 million in 2021 and were\ninsignificant in 2020.\n                                              \n  Impact of Inflation                         \n                                              \nOur assets and liabilities are primarily\nfinancial in nature and typically have varying\nmaturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in\n\nprices do not affect the obligations to pay or\nreceive fixed and determinable amounts of\nmoney. However, during periods of inflation,\n\nthere may be a subsequent impact affecting\ncertain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of\nconsumer and customer purchasing power,\n\nand fluctuations in the need or demand for our\nproducts and services. When significant levels\nof inflation occur, our business could\n\npotentially be impacted by, among other\nthings, reducing our tolerance for extending\ncredit or causing us to incur additional\ncredit\n\nlosses resulting from possible increased\ndefault rates. In the second half of 2021,\ninflation accelerated to its fastest pace in\ndecades due\n\nto strong demand but limited supplies as a\nresult of the pandemic.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives\nrepresent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net\ninvestment and result in one party delivering\ncash or another type of asset to the other\nparty based on a notional and an underlying as\nspecified in the contract. Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n\n80 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk Management                 \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to the current or\nprojected financial condition and resilience\narising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses or systems, human errors or\nmisconduct or adverse external events.\nOperational risk is inherent to the entire\norganization.\n\nOperational risk management is embedded in our\nculture and decision-making processes through\na systematic approach whereby operational\nrisks and exposures are: i) identified and\nassessed; ii) managed through the design and\nimplementation of controls; iii) measured and\nevaluated against our risk tolerance limits;\nand iv) appropriately reported to management\nand the Risk Committee. Strong operational\nrisk management and well-informed risk-based\ndecisions benefit us by improving the customer\nexperience, enhancing compliance, reducing\nreputational risk, minimizing losses and\nestablishing an appropriate amount of required\noperational risk capital held by us.\n\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is\ndesigned to provide effective and consistent\nmanagement of operational risk. The primary\npurpose of the framework is to enable us to\nunderstand our operational risks and manage\nthem to the desired risk profile, in line with\nour Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance\nestablished within the framework enables\nmanagement to make well-informed risk-based\nbusiness decisions.\n\nThe framework provides a disciplined and\nstructured process for us to manage\noperational risk across eight operational risk\ndomains. These domains provide a comprehensive\nview of operational risk and allow us to\ndiscuss operational risk in a standard way,\nfacilitating reporting and ongoing risk\nmitigation.\n\nThe operational risk domains are:\n\n\u2022 Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate\nor failed internal processes, misconduct or\nerrors of people or fraud.\n\n\u2022 Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory\nsanctions, financial loss, or damage to\nreputation resulting from failure to comply\nwith laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory\nstandards or other regulatory requirements.\n\n\u2022 Data Management: Risk associated with\nincomplete or inaccurate data.\n\n\u2022 Model: Risk associated with the design,\nimplementation and ongoing use and management\nof models.\n\n\u2022 Technology and Systems: Risk associated with\nthe use, operation and adoption of technology.\n\n\u2022 Information Security: Risk resulting from\nthe failure to protect information and ensure\nappropriate access to, and use and handling of\ninformation assets.\n\n\u2022 Business Continuity: Risk of potential\ndisruptive events to business activities.\n\n\u2022 Third Party: Risk arising from failure of\nthird party providers to conduct activity in a\nsafe and sound manner and in compliance with\ncontract provisions and applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nWe utilize operational risk management\nprograms within the framework, including Risk\nand Control Self-Assessments, scenario\nanalysis, and internal and external loss event\nreviews and analysis, to assess existing\nrisks, determine potential/emerging risks and\nevaluate the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols.

Additionally, independent risk\nmanagement reviews and challenges line of\nbusiness adherence to the framework to help\nensure proper controls are in place and\nappropriate risk mitigation plans are\nestablished as necessary.\n                                              \n  Conduct, Reputational and Strategic Risk    \n                                              \nPNC\u2019s risk culture seeks to reinforce the\nappropriate protocols for responsible and\nethical behavior through sound processes and\ncontrols. In order to promote a robust risk\nculture, the Board and executive management\nestablish code of conduct and professional\nstandards to which all employees must adhere.\nA strong risk culture discourages misconduct\nand supports conduct risk management at PNC.\nConduct risk is defined as the risk that\nemployees fail to comply with the ethical\nstandards expected of them. Strong conduct\nrisk management is important in supporting\nPNC\u2019s reputation and PNC maintains a corporate\nculture that emphasizes complying with laws,\nregulations, and managing reputational risks.\nReputational risk is the risk to the franchise\nand/or shareholder value based on a negative\nperception of PNC by its stakeholders and/or\nthe changing expectations of its stakeholders.\nStrategic risk is another component of the ERM\nFramework that is also critical to optimizing\nshareholder returns. Strategic risk is the\nrisk to earnings that may arise from adverse\nbusiness decisions, improper implementation of\nbusiness decisions and/or inadequate response\nto changes in the business environment.\nStrategic risk is considered and assessed by\nour businesses in the annual strategic\nplanning processes and monitored on an on-\ngoing basis as those plans are carried out.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 81\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nEnterprise Compliance is responsible for\noversight of compliance risk for the\norganization.

Note 1 Accounting Policies in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report describes the most\nsignificant accounting policies that we use.\nCertain of these policies require us to make\nestimates or economic assumptions that may\nvary under different assumptions or\nconditions, and such variations may\nsignificantly affect our reported results and\nfinancial position for the period or in future\nperiods.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments. Our\ndetermination of the ACL is based on\nhistorical loss and performance experience, as\nwell as current borrower and transaction\ncharacteristics including collateral type and\nquality, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply\nqualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our\nbest estimate of amounts that we do not expect\nto collect because of, among other things,\nidiosyncratic risk factors, changes in\neconomic conditions that may not be reflected\nin forecasted results, or other potential\nmethodology limitations. The major drivers of\nACL estimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Change to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\nAccounting Policies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\n\n82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC, and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios\u2019 weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2021 reflect an improved near-\nterm economic outlook compared to the\nscenarios used for the period ended December\n31, 2020. The overall improvement in the\ncomparison was driven largely by improvements\nin both the outlook for consumer spending and\nthe labor market, along with the impact from\ncontinued vaccine distribution, while also\nconsidering the lingering effects of COVID-19\nthat slowed the momentum of economic recovery\nin recent months and the impacts of supply-\nchain disruptions.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with the most significant drivers\nbeing Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate.\nThe following table presents a comparison of\nthese two economic variables based on the\nweighted-average scenario forecasts used in\ndetermining our ACL at December 31, 2021 and\n2020.\n\nTable 36: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2021                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. Real                                   \n  GDP (a)               2.8%    1.4%    1.3%  \n  (b)                                         \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.4%    4.1%    3.9%  \n  Rate (c)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2020                  \n                        2021    2022    2023  \n  U.S. Real                                   \n  GDP (a)               2.3%    2.7%    2.2%  \n  (d)                                         \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            6.8%    5.7%    5.0%  \n  Rate (c)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n(b) Year-over-year growth for 2022 in the\nassumptions used at December 31, 2021 reflects\n5.4% growth above pre-recession levels.\n\n(c) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31.\n\n(d) Year-over-year growth for 2021 in the\nassumptions used at December 31, 2020\nreflected growth that remained 0.5% below pre-\nrecession levels.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to remain robust\nin 2022, with output expanding 2.8% on a\nweighted-average basis, similar to the 2.7%\nweighted-average expectation this time last\nyear, before slowing to 1.4% and 1.3% in 2023\nand 2024, respectively. The improvement in the\nlabor market has outpaced expectations over\nthe past year. As such, the weighted-average\nprojection of the unemployment rate is\nexpected to end 2022 at 4.4% and 2023 at 4.1%.\nThis is an improvement from the weighted-\naverage projections taken as of December 31,\n2020, which had the unemployment rate reaching\n5.7% and 5.0% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe economy has seen significant recovery from\nthe onset of the pandemic. National\nmacroeconomic indicators, forecasts and\nperformance expectations have all steadily\nimproved, helping to lower overall loss\nexpectations. These improvements have been\nreflected in the reserve releases throughout\n2021, including in certain segments initially\nimpacted by COVID-19 related restrictions.\nHowever, for certain portions of our\ncommercial and consumer portfolios,\nconsiderable uncertainty remains regarding\nlifetime losses. For commercial borrowers,\nthere are still lingering concerns around\nindustries that have been affected by COVID-19\nrelated restrictions and emerging secular\nchanges. For these industries, where\nunrestricted commerce has recently returned,\nthe recovery will lag the broader economy.\nWhere restrictions persist and/or secular\nchanges have emerged, the impact and eventual\nlevel of recovery are less certain. For\nconsumer borrowers, payment behavior upon\nexpiration of government stimulus, including\nexpired enhanced unemployment benefits is\nstill difficult to predict. As such, for both\nour commercial and consumer loan portfolios,\nPNC identified and performed significant\nanalysis around these segments to ensure our\nreserves are adequate in the current economic\nenvironment. We believe the economic scenarios\nhave effectively provided sufficient variation\nto capture probable recovery paths.\nAdditionally, through in-depth and granular\nanalysis of COVID-19 related impacts, we have\naddressed reserve requirements for specific\npopulations most affected in the current\nenvironment. Through this approach, we believe\nthe reserve levels appropriately reflect the\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio as of\nthe balance sheet date.\n\nTo provide additional context regarding the\nsensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic\nforecast of expected economic outcomes, we\nconsidered what our ACL would be when applying\na 100% probability weighting to the most\nseverely adverse scenario. This severely\nadverse scenario estimated that Real GDP\ncontracted in 2022 ending the year down 2.1%\ncompared to 2021 levels, with growth\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 83\npicking up again beginning in 2023, while the\nunemployment rate increased to end 2022 at\n7.9% before gradually improving again through\n2023 and 2024. Excluding consideration of\nqualitative adjustments, this sensitivity\nanalysis would result in a hypothetical\nincrease in our ACL of $2.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021. This scenario was not our\nexpectation at December 31, 2021 and does not\nreflect our current expectation, nor does it\ncapture all the potential unknown variables\nthat could arise in the forecast period, but\nit provides an approximation of a possible\noutcome under hypothetical severe conditions.\nThe CECL methodology inherently requires a\nhigh degree of judgment, and as a result, it\nis possible that we may, at another point in\ntime, reach different conclusions regarding\nour credit loss estimates.\n\nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing\nRights\n\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value.\nThis election was made to be consistent with\nour risk management strategy to hedge changes\nin the fair value of these assets. The fair\nvalue of our MSRs is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model which\ncalculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into\nconsideration actual and expected mortgage\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs, and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\n\nWe employ risk management strategies designed\nto protect the value of MSRs from changes in\ninterest rates and related market factors. The\nvalues of the MSRs are economically hedged\nwith securities and derivatives, including\ninterest-rate swaps, options, and forward\nmortgage-backed and futures contracts. As\ninterest rates change, these financial\ninstruments are expected to have changes in\nfair value negatively correlated to the change\nin fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios.\nThe hedge relationships are actively managed\nin response to changing market conditions over\nthe life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate\nfinancial instruments to economically hedge\nresidential or commercial MSRs requires\nsignificant management judgment to assess how\nmortgage rates and prepayment speeds could\naffect the future values of MSRs. Hedging\nresults can frequently be less predictable in\nthe short term, but over longer periods of\ntime are expected to protect the economic\nvalue of the MSRs.\n\nFor information on how each estimate has\nchanged and a sensitivity analysis of the\nhypothetical effect of the fair value of MSRs\nto immediate adverse changes in key\nassumptions, see Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage\nServicing Rights in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nFor additional information on our residential\nand commercial MSRs, see Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage\nServicing Rights and Note 15 Fair Value in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 8 of this Report.\n                                              \n  Fair Value Measurements - Level 3           \n                                              \nWe must use estimates, assumptions and\njudgments when assets and liabilities are\nrequired to be recorded at, or adjusted to\nreflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value inherently result in a\nhigher degree of financial statement\nvolatility. When observable price and third-\nparty information is not available, we\nestimate fair value primarily by using cash\nflow and other financial modeling techniques.\nChanges in underlying factors, assumptions, or\nestimates in any of these valuation techniques\ncould materially impact our future financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nWe apply ASC 820 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\nThis guidance defines fair value as the price\nthat would be received to sell a financial\nasset or paid to transfer a financial\nliability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nThis guidance requires a three level hierarchy\nfor disclosure of assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value. The classification of\nassets and liabilities within the hierarchy is\nbased on whether the inputs to the valuation\nmethodology used in the measurement are\nobservable or unobservable. Level 3 assets and\nliabilities are those where the fair value is\nestimated using significant unobservable\ninputs. While estimating potential\nsensitivities around fair value measurements\nis inherently challenging, we provide a\nsummary of the key unobservable inputs in Note\n15 Fair Value in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n\nFor additional information on Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements, see Note 15 Fair Value in\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Item 8 of this Report.\n                                              \n  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  \n                                              \nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Report regarding the impact of new\naccounting pronouncements which we have\nadopted.\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for financial\nperformance, such as earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\n84 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time.

These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to be softer in\nthe first quarter of 2022 due to the omicron\nvariant, and then pick up in the spring,\nremaining above the economy\u2019s long-run average\nthroughout this year. Consumer spending growth\nwill remain solid in 2022 due to good\nunderlying fundamentals.\n\n\u2013 Supply-chain difficulties, which weighed on\ngrowth in the second half of 2021, will\ngradually ease over the course of 2022. Labor\nshortages will remain a constraint this year,\nalthough strong wage growth will support\nconsumer spending.\n\n\u2013 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to\nstrong demand but limited supplies coming out\nof the pandemic for some goods and services.\nInflation will slow in 2022 as supply and\ndemand for these goods and services normalize,\nbut also broaden throughout the economy due to\nwage growth. Inflation will end 2022 above the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 0.25 percentage points five\ntimes in 2022 to reach a range of 1.25% to\n1.50% by the end of the year, and then further\nincrease the federal funds rate in 2023. The\nFederal Reserve will also end its purchases of\nlong-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed\nsecurities in March 2022, and then start to\nreduce its balance sheet in mid-2022.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding a SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 85\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our acquisition of BBVA presents us with\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nintegration of the acquired business into PNC\nincluding:\n\n\u2013 The business of BBVA going forward may not\nperform as we project or in a manner\nconsistent with historical performance. As a\nresult, the anticipated benefits, including\nestimated cost savings, of the transaction may\nbe significantly more difficult or take longer\nto achieve than expected or may not be\nachieved in their entirety as a result of\nunexpected factors or events, including those\nthat are outside of our control.\n\n\u2013 The integration of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with that of PNC\nand PNC Bank may be more difficult to achieve\nthan anticipated or have unanticipated adverse\nresults. Our ability to integrate BBVA,\nincluding its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA\nUSA, successfully may be adversely affected by\nthe fact that this transaction results in us\nentering several geographical markets where we\ndid not previously have any meaningful\npresence.\n\n\u2022 I n addition to the BBVA transaction, we\ngrow our business in part through acquisitions\nand new strategic initiatives. Risks and\nuncertainties include those presented by the\nnature of the business acquired and strategic\ninitiative, including in some cases those\nassociated with our entry into new businesses\nor new geographic or other markets and risks\nresulting from our inexperience in those new\nareas, as well as risks and uncertainties\nrelated to the acquisition transactions\nthemselves, regulatory issues, and the\nintegration of the acquired businesses into\nPNC after closing.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures,

consolidated\nbalance sheet of The PNC Financial Services\nGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the\n\u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nand the related consolidated statements of\nincome, comprehensive income, changes in\nequity and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2021,\nincluding the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial\nstatements\u201d). We also have audited the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2021 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCOSO.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company changed the\nmanner in which it accounts for the allowance\nfor credit losses in 2020.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinions                          \n                                              \nThe Company's management is responsible for\nthese consolidated financial statements, for\nmaintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 87\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matters communicated below\nare matters arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loans and Lease Losses \u2013\nCommercial Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loans and lease losses was\napproximately $4,868 million as of December\n31, 2021, of which $3,185 million relates to\ncommercial loans. For commercial loans, the\ndetermination of the allowance is based on\nhistorical loss experience, current borrower\nrisk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\neconomic forecasts and other relevant factors.\nAs disclosed by management, the Company\nconsiders reasonable and supportable forecasts\nin estimating expected credit losses and has\nestablished a framework which includes the use\nof four economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. To generate the four economic\nforecast scenarios, the Company uses a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic\nmodels, other measures of economic activity\nand forward-looking judgment to forecast the\ndistribution of economic outcomes. Management\nused a number of economic variables in the\nscenarios, which are inputs into the loss\nforecasting models, with the most significant\ndrivers being Real GDP and U.S. unemployment\nrate. Also included in the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans are\nqualitative reserves to cover losses that are\nexpected but, in the Company\u2019s assessment, may\nnot be adequately represented in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. For example, qualitative factors\nmay include industry concentration and\nconditions, including the impacts of COVID-19\non highly impacted segments, changes in market\nconditions, changes in the nature and volume\nof the Company\u2019s portfolio, recent credit\nquality trends, recent loss experience in\nparticular portfolios, recent macroeconomic\nfactors, limitations of available input data,\nmodel imprecision, changes in lending\npolicies, and other factors.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in developing\neconomic forecast scenarios of Real GDP and\nU.S. unemployment rate, determining weighting\nof each scenario, and estimating qualitative\nreserves related to the impacts of COVID-19 on\ncertain highly impacted segments, which in\nturn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity and effort in performing\nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence\nrelated to management\u2019s significant judgements\nand estimations and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the allowance for loan\nand lease losses for commercial loans,\nincluding controls over the development and\napproval of economic forecast scenarios,\nrelated weightings, and qualitative reserves.\nThese procedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for determining\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans, including (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness and methodology of certain\nloss forecasting models, (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain borrower risk\ncharacteristics, (iii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain forecasted economic\nvariables, including Real GDP and U.S.\nunemployment rate, (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s weighting of\neconomic forecast scenarios used in the loss\nforecast models, (v) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the estimate, and\n(vi) evaluating certain qualitative reserves\nmade to the model output results to determine\nthe overall allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for commercial loans. The procedures\nalso included the involvement of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist\nin evaluating certain models, model inputs,\neconomic forecasts, and qualitative reserves\nin the allowance for commercial loans.\n\nAcquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. -\nFair Value of Commercial Loans Acquired\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company acquired\nBBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cBBVA\u201d) on June 1,\n2021. The transaction has been accounted for\nas a business combination and accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA were recorded\nat fair value as of the acquisition date. The\nfair value of loans acquired from BBVA was\napproximately $61,423 million as of June 1,\n2021, of which $39,742 million were commercial\nloans. For commercial loans, as disclosed by\nmanagement, the fair value is based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology that\nconsiders credit loss and prepayment\nexpectations, market interest rates and other\nmarket factors.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the fair value of commercial loans\nacquired is a critical audit matter are (i)\nthe significant judgment and estimation by\nmanagement in developing the credit loss\nexpectations, prepayment expectations, and\nmarket interest rates used in the discounted\ncash flow methodology, which in turn led to a\nhigh degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity,\nand effort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained related to\nthe\n\n88 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nsignificant judgments and estimations by\nmanagement, and (ii) the audit effort involved\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the fair value of\ncommercial loans acquired, including controls\nover the credit loss expectations, prepayment\nexpectations, and market interest rates used\nin the discounted cash flow methodology. These\nprocedures also included, among others (i) the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge to assist in developing\nindependent ranges of fair value for the\ncommercial loans acquired, including the\ndevelopment of independent expectations for\ncredit losses, prepayments, and market\ninterest rates, (ii) comparing management\u2019s\nestimate to the independently developed\nranges, and (iii) testing the completeness and\naccuracy of the underlying loan data provided\nby management that was used to develop these\nexpectations.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

Our results for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021 reflect\nBBVA's acquired business operations for the\nperiod since the acquisition closed on June 1,\n2021. Our balance sheet at December 31, 2021\nincludes balances from BBVA. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity for\nadditional information related to this\nacquisition.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements, including for the\nBBVA acquisition. Actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates and the differences may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash\nand cash equivalents for financial reporting\npurposes because they represent a primary\nsource of liquidity. Certain cash balances\nwithin Cash and due from banks on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as\nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding\ncontractual agreements or regulatory\nrequirements.\nInvestments\nWe hold interests in various types of\ninvestments. The accounting for these\ninvestments is dependent on a number of\nfactors including, but not limited to, items\nsuch as:\n\u2022 Ownership interest,\n\u2022 Our plans for the investment, and\n\u2022 The nature of the investment.\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date\nbasis. We classify debt securities as either\ntrading, held to maturity, or available for\nsale. Debt securities that we purchase for\ncertain risk management activities or\ncustomer-related trading activities are\nclassified as trading securities, are reported\nin the Other assets line item on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and are carried at\nfair value. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses on trading securities are included in\nOther noninterest income. We classify debt\nsecurities as held to maturity when we have\nthe positive intent and ability to hold the\nsecurities to maturity, and carry them at\namortized cost, less any allowance. Debt\nsecurities not classified as held to maturity\nor trading are classified as securities\navailable for sale and are carried at fair\nvalue. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable for sale securities are included in\nAOCI net of income taxes.\n96 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nWe include all interest on debt securities,\nincluding amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on investment\nsecurities, in net interest income using the\nconstant effective yield method generally\ncalculated over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities. Effective yields reflect either\nthe effective interest rate implicit in the\nsecurity at the date of acquisition or, for\ndebt securities where an OTTI was recorded,\nthe effective interest rate determined based\non improved cash flows subsequent to an\nimpairment. We compute gains and losses\nrealized on the sale of available for sale\ndebt securities on a specific security basis.\nThese securities gains and losses are included\nin Other noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe CECL standard requires expected credit\nlosses on both held to maturity and available\nfor sale securities to be recognized through a\nvaluation allowance, ACL, instead of as a\ndirect write-down to the amortized cost basis\nof the security. An available for sale\nsecurity is considered impaired if the fair\nvalue is less than its amortized cost basis.\nIf any portion of the decline in fair value is\nrelated to credit, the amount of allowance is\ndetermined as the portion related to credit,\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis and the fair value of the\nsecurity. If we have the intent to sell or\nbelieve it is more likely than not we will be\nrequired to sell an impaired available for\nsale security before recovery of the amortized\ncost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a\ndirect write-down of the amortized cost basis.\nCredit losses on investment securities are\nrecognized through the Provision for credit\nlosses on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nDeclines in the fair value of available for\nsale securities that are not considered credit\nrelated are recognized in AOCI on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The CECL standard\nwas applied prospectively to debt securities\nand, as a result, the amortized cost basis of\ninvestment securities for which OTTI had\npreviously been recorded did not change upon\nadoption.\n\nWe consider a security to be past due in terms\nof payment based on its contractual terms. A\nsecurity may be placed on nonaccrual, with\ninterest no longer recognized until received,\nwhen collectability of principal or interest\nis doubtful. As of December 31, 2021,\nnonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity and\navailable-for-sale securities were immaterial.\n\nA security may be partially or fully charged\noff against the allowance if it is determined\nto be uncollectible, including, for an\navailable for sale security, if we have the\nintent to sell or believe it is more likely\nthan not we will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of the amortized cost\nbasis. Recoveries of previously charged-off\navailable for sale securities are recognized\nwhen received, while recoveries on held to\nmaturity securities are recognized when\nexpected.\n\nSee the Allowance for Credit Losses section of\nthis Note 1 for further discussion regarding\nthe methodologies used to determine the\n\nallowance for investment securities. See Note\n3 Investment Securities for additional\ninformation about the investment securities\nportfolio and the related ACL.\n\nEquity Securities and Partnership Interests\n\nWe account for equity securities, equity\ninvestments, private equity investments, and\ninvestments in limited partnerships, limited\nliability companies and other investments that\nare not required to be consolidated under one\nof the following methods:\n\n\u2022 We use the equity method for general and\nlimited partner ownership interests and\nlimited liability companies in which we are\nconsidered to have significant influence over\nthe operations of the investee. Under the\nequity method, we record our equity ownership\nshare of net income or loss of the investee in\nNoninterest income and any dividends received\non equity method investments are recorded as a\nreduction to the investment balance. When an\nequity investment experiences an other-than-\ntemporary decline in value, we may be required\nto record a loss on the investment.\n\n\u2022 We measure equity securities that have a\nreadily determinable fair value at fair value\nthrough Net income. Both realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are included in\nNoninterest income. Dividend income on these\nequity securities is included in Other\ninterest income on our Consolidated Income\nStatement.\n\n\u2022 We generally use the practicability\nexception to fair value measurement for all\nother investments without a readily\ndeterminable fair value. When we elect this\nalternative measurement method, the investment\nis recorded at cost and the carrying value is\nadjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus\nchanges in value resulting from observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for\nidentical or similar instruments of the same\nissuer. Adjustments to fair value based on\nchanges in observable price are recorded in\nOther noninterest income. These investments\nare written down to fair value if a\nqualitative assessment indicates impairment\nand the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue. The amount of the write-down is\naccounted for as a loss included in Other\nnoninterest income. Distributions received on\nthese investments are included in Noninterest\nincome.\n\nInvestments described above are included in\nEquity investments on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\nPrivate Equity Investments\n\nWe report private equity investments, which\ninclude direct investments in companies,\naffiliated partnership interests and indirect\ninvestments in private equity funds, at\nestimated fair value. These estimates are\nbased on available information and may not\nnecessarily represent amounts that we will\nultimately realize through distribution, sale\nor liquidation of the investments. Fair values\nof publicly-traded direct investments are\ndetermined using quoted market prices and are\nsubject to various discount factors arising\nfrom security level restrictions, when\nappropriate. The valuation procedures applied\nto direct investments and indirect investments\nare\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 97\ndetailed in Note 15 Fair Value. We include all\nprivate equity investments within Equity\ninvestments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nChanges in fair value of private equity\ninvestments are recognized in Other\nnoninterest income.\n\nWe consolidate affiliated partnerships when we\nhave determined that we have control of the\npartnership or are the primary beneficiary if\nthe entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own\nis reflected in Noncontrolling interests on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment\nwhen management has both the intent and\nability to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff.\nManagement\u2019s intent and view of the\nforeseeable future may change based on changes\nin business strategies, the economic\nenvironment, market conditions and the\navailability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on\nthe contractual terms of each loan. Loans that\nare 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. See Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nfor additional information on how COVID-19\nhardship related loan modifications are\nreported from a delinquency perspective as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD\nloans, are recorded at amortized cost basis\nunless we elect to measure these under the\nfair value option. Amortized cost basis\nrepresents principal amounts outstanding, net\nof unearned income, unamortized deferred fees\nand costs on originated loans, premiums or\ndiscounts on purchased loans and charge-offs.\nAmortized cost basis does not include accrued\ninterest, as we include accrued interest in\nOther assets on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued\nbased on the principal amount outstanding and\nrecorded in Interest income as earned using\nthe constant effective yield method over the\ncontractual life. Loan origination fees,\ndirect loan origination costs, and loan\npremiums and discounts are deferred and\naccreted or amortized into Net interest income\nusing the constant effective yield method,\nover the contractual life of the loan. The\nprocessing fee received for loans originated\nthrough PPP lending under the CARES Act is\ndeferred and accreted into Net interest income\nusing the effective yield method, over the\ncontractual life of the loan. Loans under the\nfair value option are reported at their fair\nvalue, with any changes to fair value reported\nas Noninterest income on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement, and are excluded from\nmeasurement of ALLL.\nIn addition to originating loans, we also\nacquire loans through the secondary loan\nmarket, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of\nother financial services companies. Certain\nacquired loans that have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration of credit\nquality since origination (i.e., PCD) are\nrecognized at an amortized cost basis equal to\ntheir purchase price plus an ALLL measured at\nthe acquisition date. PNC considers a variety\nof factors in connection with the\nidentification of more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality, including but\nnot limited to nonperforming status,\ndelinquency, risk ratings, TDR classification\nand other qualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Subsequent decreases in expected\ncash flows that are attributable, at least in\npart, to credit quality are recognized through\na charge to the provision for credit losses\nresulting in an increase in the ALLL.\nSubsequent increases in expected cash flows\nare recognized as a provision recapture of\npreviously recorded ALLL .\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent\nwhen we determine that substantially all of\nthe expected cash flows will be generated\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, or when the borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty and we have\nelected to measure the loan at the estimated\nfair value of collateral (less costs to sell\nif sale or foreclosure of the property is\nexpected).\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be\ncollateral dependent when foreclosure or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral is\nprobable.\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. A concession has been\ngranted when we do not expect to collect all\namounts due, including original interest\naccrued at the original contract rate, as a\nresult of the restructuring, or there is a\ndelay in payment that is more-than-\ninsignificant. TDRs result from our loss\nmitigation activities, and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization, and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us. In those\nsituations where principal is forgiven, the\namount of such principal forgiveness is\nimmediately charged off.\nPotential incremental losses or recoveries on\nTDRs have been factored into the ALLL\nestimates for each loan class under the\nmethodologies described in this Note. Once a\nloan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be\nreported as a TDR until it is ultimately\nrepaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed\nupon or it is fully charged off.\nPNC excludes loans held for sale, loans\naccounted for under the fair value option and\ncertain government insured or guaranteed loans\nfrom our TDR population. PCD loans do not\nrequire additional considerations and thus are\nevaluated for inclusion in our TDR population.\nIn addition, PNC has elected not to apply a\nTDR designation to loans that have been\nrestructured due to a COVID-19 hardship\npursuant to specific criteria under the CARES\nAct for restructurings that occurred prior to\nthe expiration of TDR relief on January 1,\n2022. Since loans restructured due to a\nCOVID-19 related hardship were not identified\nas TDRs, they are not placed on\n98 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nnonaccrual at the time of modification unless\npayment in full of principal or interest is\nnot expected. These loans continue to be\nsubject to our existing nonaccrual policy.\n\nSee the following for additional information\nrelated to loans, including further discussion\nregarding our policies, the methodologies and\nsignificant inputs used to determine the ALLL\nand additional details on the composition of\nour loan portfolio:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming Loans and Leases section of\nthis Note

industrial, commercial real estate and\nequipment lease financing) nonperforming loans\nwhen we determine that a specific loan, or\nportion thereof, is uncollectible. This\ndetermination is based on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the individual loans. In\nmaking this determination, we consider the\nviability of the business or project as a\ngoing concern, the past due status when the\nasset is not well-secured, the expected cash\nflows to repay the loan, the value of the\ncollateral and the ability and willingness of\nany guarantors to perform. For commercial\nloans and leases less than a defined dollar\nthreshold, balances are charged-off in full\nafter pre-determined days past due.\n\nConsumer\n\nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home\nequity, residential real estate and\nautomobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                  Form 10-K 99\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell, if\nlower than the amortized cost basis of the\nloan outstanding, when delinquency of the\nloan, combined with other risk factors (e.g.,\nbankruptcy, lien position or troubled debt\nrestructuring), indicates that the loan, or\nsome portion thereof, is uncollectible as per\nour historical experience, or the collateral\nhas been repossessed. We charge-off secured\nconsumer loans no later than 180days past due.\nMost consumer loans and lines of credit, not\nsecured by automobiles or residential real\nestate, are charged-off once they have reached\n120- 180days past due.\n\nFor secured collateral dependent loans,\ncollateral values are updated at least\nannually and subsequent declines in collateral\nvalues are charged-off resulting in\nincremental provision for credit loss.\nSubsequent increases in collateral values may\nbe reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to\nreflect the expectation of recoveries in an\namount greater than previously expected,\nlimited to amounts previously charged-off.\n\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases\nand Other Nonaccrual Loans\n\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual\nand deferred fee/cost recognition is\ndiscontinued. Additionally, depending on\nwhether the accrued interest has been\nincorporated into the ACL estimates, as\ndiscussed in the Accrued Interest section of\nthis Note 1, the accrued and uncollected\ninterest is either reversed through Net\ninterest income (if a CECL reserve is not\nmaintained for accrued interest) or charged-\noff against the allowance (if a CECL reserve\nis maintained for accrued interest), except\nfor credit cards, where we reverse any accrued\ninterest through Net interest income at the\ntime of charge-off, as per industry standard\npractice. Nonaccrual loans that are also\ncollateral dependent may be charged-off to\nreduce the basis to the fair value of\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan,\ngenerally the payment is first applied to the\nremaining principal balance; payments are then\napplied to recover any charged-off amounts\nrelated to the loan. Finally, if both\nprincipal balance and any charge-offs have\nbeen recovered, then the payment will be\nrecorded as fee and interest income. For\ncertain consumer loans, the receipt of\ninterest payments is recognized as interest\nincome on a cash basis. Cash basis income\nrecognition is applied if a loan\u2019s amortized\ncost basis is deemed fully collectible and the\nloan has performed for at least six months.\n\nFor TDRs, payments are applied based upon\ntheir contractual terms unless the related\nloan is deemed non-performing. TDRs are\ngenerally included in nonperforming and\nnonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable\nperiod of time, generally six months, in which\nthe loan performs under restructured terms and\nmeets other performance indicators, it is\nreturned to performing/accruing status. This\nreturn to performing/accruing status\ndemonstrates that the bank expects to collect\nall of the loan\u2019s remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest. TDRs resulting from\n(i) borrowers that have been discharged from\npersonal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed\ntheir loan obligations to us, and (ii)\nborrowers that are not currently obligated to\nmake both principal and interest payments\nunder the restructured terms are not returned\nto accrual status.\n\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not\nreturned to accrual status until the borrower\nhas performed in accordance with the\ncontractual terms and other performance\nindicators for at least six months, the period\nof time which was determined to demonstrate\nthe expected collection of the loan\u2019s\nremaining contractual principal and interest.\nNonaccrual loans with partially charged-off\nprincipal are not returned to accrual. When a\nnonperforming loan is returned to accrual\nstatus, it is then considered a performing\nloan.\n\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized\nor property acquired through a foreclosure\nproceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure. OREO comprises principally\ncommercial and residential real estate\nproperties obtained in partial or total\nsatisfaction of loan obligations. After\nobtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some\njurisdictions the initiation of proceedings\nunder a power of sale in the loan instruments,\nthe property will be sold. When we are awarded\ntitle or completion of deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure, we transfer the loan to\nforeclosed assets included in Other assets on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property\nobtained in satisfaction of a loan is\ninitially recorded at estimated fair value\nless cost to sell. Based upon the estimated\nfair value less cost to sell, the amortized\ncost basis of the loan is adjusted and a\ncharge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL.\nWe estimate fair values primarily based on\nappraisals, or sales agreements with third\nparties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are\nvalued at the lower of the amount recorded at\nacquisition date or estimated fair value less\ncost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these\nassets and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of such property are reflected in\nOther noninterest expense.\n\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a\ngovernment guarantee, we establish a separate\nother receivable upon foreclosure. The\nreceivable is measured based on the loan\nbalance (inclusive of principal and interest)\nthat is expected to be recovered from the\nguarantor.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses in this Report for additional\ninformation on nonperforming assets, TDRs and\ncredit quality indicators related to our loan\nportfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL, in accordance with the CECL standard,\nis based on historical loss experience,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics, current\neconomic conditions, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future conditions and\nother relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at\nan\nappropriate level for expected losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the estimated contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures as of the\nbalance sheet date. The\n100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nremaining contractual term of assets in scope\nof CECL is estimated considering contractual\nmaturity dates, prepayment expectations,\nutilization or draw expectations and any\nembedded extension options that do not allow\nus to unilaterally cancel the extension\noptions. For products without a fixed\ncontractual maturity date ( e.g ., credit\ncards), we rely on historical payment behavior\nto determine the length of the paydown or\ndefault time period.\n\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis\nusing a combination of (i) the expected losses\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii) a period of reversion to long run\naverage expected losses where applicable and\n(iii) the long run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term. For\nall assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also\nincludes individually assessed reserves and\nqualitative reserves, as applicable.\n\nWe use forward-looking information in\nestimating expected credit losses for our\nreasonable and supportable forecast period.\nFor this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios\nproduced by PNC\u2019s Economics Team, which are\ndesigned to reflect business cycles and their\nrelated estimated probabilities. The forecast\nlength that we have determined to be\nreasonable and supportable is three years. As\nnoted in the methodology discussions that\nfollow, forward-looking information is\nincorporated into the expected credit loss\nestimates. Such forward looking information\nincludes forecasted relevant macroeconomic\nvariables, which are estimated using\nquantitative macroeconomic models, analysis\nfrom PNC economists and management judgment.\n\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our\nthree year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and the long run average expected\ncredit losses. We consider a number of factors\nin determining the duration of the reversion\nperiod, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the\nestimated credit loss rates at the end of the\nforecast period relative to the beginning of\nthe long run average period. The reversion\nperiod is typically 1-3 years, if not\nimmediate.\n\nThe long run average expected credit losses\nare derived from long run historical credit\nloss information adjusted for the credit\nquality of the current portfolio, and\ntherefore do not consider current and\nforecasted economic conditions.\n\nSee the following sections related to\ninvestment securities, loans, trade\nreceivables, other financial assets and\nunfunded lending related commitments for\ndetails about specific methodologies.\n\nAllowance for Investment Securities\n\nA significant portion of our investment\nsecurities are issued or guaranteed by either\nthe U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or GNMA) or\na government-sponsored agency (FNMA or FHLMC).\nTaking into consideration historical\ninformation and current and forecasted\nconditions, we do not expect to incur any\ncredit losses on these securities.\n\nInvestment securities that are not issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government or a\ngovernment-sponsored agency consist of both\nsecuritized products, such as non-agency\nmortgage and asset-backed securities, as well\nas non-securitized products, such as corporate\nand municipal debt securities. A discounted\ncash flow approach is primarily used to\ndetermine the amount of the allowance\nrequired. The estimates of expected cash flows\nare determined using macroeconomic sensitive\nmodels taking into consideration the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period and\nscenarios discussed above. Additional factors\nunique to a specific security may also be\ntaken into consideration when estimating\nexpected cash flows. The cash flows expected\nto be collected, after considering expected\nprepayments, are discounted at the effective\ninterest rate. For an available-for-sale\nsecurity, the amount of the allowance is\nlimited to the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nestimated fair value.\n\nSee Note 3 Investment Securities in this\nReport for additional information about the\ninvestment securities portfolio.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 101\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based\nupon the quantification of risk parameters,\nsuch as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan or loan\nsegment. We also consider the impact of\nprepayments and amortization on contractual\nmaturity in our expected loss estimates. We\nuse historical credit loss information,\ncurrent borrower risk characteristics and\nforecasted economic variables for the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period,\ncoupled with analytical methods, to estimate\nthese risk parameters by loan or loan\nsegments.

the\nlong run average over the reversion period\nnoted above, which is the period between the\nend of the forecast period and when losses are\nestimated to have completely reverted to the\nlong run average.\n\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of\ncredit losses ( i.e. , for the forecast\nperiod, reversion period and long run average)\nunder each of the forecasted scenarios, we\nproduce a probability-weighted credit loss\nestimate by loan class. We then add or deduct\nany qualitative components and other\nadjustments, such as individually assessed\nloans, to produce the ALLL. See the\nIndividually Assessed Component and\nQualitative Component discussions that follow\nin this Note 1 for additional information\nabout those adjustments.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n\nIn addition to TDRs, we also use a discounted\ncash flow methodology for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes. We\ndetermine effective interest rates considering\ncontractual cash flows adjusted for estimated\nprepayments. Changes in the ALLL due to the\nimpact of the passage of time under the\ndiscounted cash flow estimate are recognized\nthrough the provision for credit losses.\n\nIndividually Assessed Component\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with a pool of loans are\nindividually assessed as follows:\n\n\u2022 For commercial nonperforming loans greater\nthan or equal to a defined dollar threshold,\nreserves are based on an analysis of the\npresent value of the loan\u2019s expected future\ncash flows or the fair value of the\ncollateral, if appropriate under our policy\nfor collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans below the defined threshold,\nand accruing TDRs are reserved for under a\npooled basis.\n\n\u2022 For consumer nonperforming loans classified\nas collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL\nrelated to recovery of amounts previously\ncharged-off are evaluated through an analysis\nof the fair value of the collateral less costs\nto sell.\n\nQualitative Component\n\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to\nreflect all relevant credit risk factors,\nthere continues to be uncertainty associated\nwith, but not limited to, potential\nimprecision in the estimation process due to\nthe inherent time lag of obtaining information\nand normal variations between expected and\nactual outcomes. We may hold additional\nreserves that are designed to provide coverage\nfor losses attributable to such risks. The ACL\nalso takes into account factors that may not\nbe directly measured in the determination of\nindividually assessed or pooled reserves. Such\nqualitative factors may include, but are not\nlimited to:\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 103\n\u2022 Industry concentrations and conditions,\nincluding the impacts of COVID-19 on highly\nimpacted segments,\n\n\u2022 Changes in market conditions, including\nregulatory and legal requirements,\n\n\u2022 Changes in the nature and volume of our\nportfolio,\n\n\u2022 Recent credit quality trends, including the\nimpact of COVID-19 hardship related loan\nmodifications,\n\n\u2022 Recent loss experience in particular\nportfolios, including specific and unique\nevents,\n\n\u2022 Recent macroeconomic factors that may not be\nreflected in the forecast information,\n\n\u2022 Limitations of available input data,\nincluding historical loss information and\nrecent data such as collateral values,\n\n\u2022 Model imprecision and limitations,\n\n\u2022 Changes in lending policies and procedures,\nincluding changes in loss recognition and\nmitigation policies and procedures,\n\n\u2022 Timing of available information, including\nthe performance of first lien positions.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nour loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-\noff in a timely manner, the CECL standard\nprovides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We\nconsider our nonaccrual and charge-off\npolicies to be timely for all of our\ninvestment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the\nexception of consumer credit cards, education\nloans and certain unsecured consumer lines of\ncredit. We consider the length of time before\nnonaccrual/charge-off and the use of\nappropriate other triggering events for\nnonaccrual and charge-offs in making this\ndetermination. Pursuant to these policy\nelections, we calculate reserves for accrued\ninterest on credit cards, education loans and\ncertain unsecured consumer lines of credit,\nwhich are then included within the ALLL. See\nthe Debt Securities and Nonperforming Loans\nand Leases sections of this Note 1 for\nadditional information on our nonaccrual and\ncharge-off policies.\nAdditionally, pursuant to our use of a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology in estimating\ncredit losses for our home equity and\nresidential real estate loan classes,\napplicable reserves for accrued interest are\nalso included within the ALLL for these loan\nclasses .\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or\nSecurities\n\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is\ndetermined at the time of acquisition\n(including January 1, 2020 when certain\npurchased impaired loans were grandfathered\nand transitioned to PCD upon adoption of\nCECL), as the estimated expected credit loss\nof the outstanding balance or par value, based\non the methodologies described previously for\nloans and securities. In accordance with CECL,\nthe allowance recognized at acquisition is\nadded to the acquisition date purchase price\nto determine the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis.\n\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related\nCommitments\n\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending\nrelated commitments on off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures that are not unconditionally\ncancelable (e.g., unfunded loan commitments,\nletters of credit and certain financial\nguarantees), at a level we believe is\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on these\nexposures. Other than the estimation of the\nprobability of funding, this reserve is\nestimated in a manner similar to the\nmethodology used for determining reserves for\nloans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan\nand Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for\nthe key credit risk characteristics for\nunfunded lending related commitments. The\nallowance for unfunded lending related\ncommitments is recorded as a liability on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to\nthis reserve are included in the provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for\nCredit Losses for additional information about\nthis allowance.\n\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets\n\nWe determine the allowance for other financial\nassets (e.g., trade receivables, servicing\nadvances on PNC-owned loans, balances with\nbanks) considering historical loss information\nand other available indicators. In certain\ncases where there are no historical, current\nor forecast indicators of an expected credit\nloss, we may estimate the reserve to be close\nto zero. As of December 31, 2021, the\nallowance for other financial assets was\nimmaterial.\nLoans Held for Sale\nWe designate loans as held for sale when we\nhave the intent and ability to sell them. At\nthe time of designation to held for sale, any\nACL is reversed, and a valuation allowance for\nthe shortfall between the amortized cost basis\nand the net realizable value is recognized,\nexcluding the amounts already charged off.\nSimilarly, when loans are no longer considered\nheld for sale, the valuation allowance (net of\nwritedowns) is reversed, and an allowance for\ncredit losses is established, excluding the\namounts already charged-off. Write-downs on\nthese loans (if required) are recorded as\ncharge-offs through the valuation allowance.\nAdjustments to the valuation allowance on held\nfor sale loans are recognized in Other\nnoninterest income.\nWe have elected to account for certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale at fair value. The changes in the\nfair value of the commercial mortgage loans\nare measured and recorded in Other noninterest\nincome while such changes for the residential\n104 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nmortgage loans are measured and recorded in\nResidential mortgage noninterest income each\nperiod. See Note 15 Fair Value for additional\ninformation.\n\nInterest income with respect to loans held for\nsale is accrued based on the principal amount\noutstanding and the loan\u2019s contractual\ninterest rate.\n\nIn certain circumstances, loans designated as\nheld for sale may be transferred to held for\ninvestment based on a change in strategy. We\ntransfer these loans at the lower of cost or\nestimated fair value; however, any loans\noriginated or purchased for the held for sale\nportfolio and for which the fair value option\nhas been elected remain at fair value for the\nlife of the loan.\nLoan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained\nInterests\nWe recognize the sale of loans or other\nfinancial assets when the transferred assets\nare legally isolated from our creditors and\nthe appropriate accounting criteria are met.\nWe have sold mortgage and other loans through\nsecuritization transactions. In a\nsecuritization, financial assets are\ntransferred into trusts or to SPEs in\ntransactions to effectively legally isolate\nthe assets from us.\nIn a securitization, the trust or SPE issues\nbeneficial interests in the form of senior and\nsubordinated securities backed or\ncollateralized by the assets sold to the\ntrust. The senior classes of the asset-backed\nsecurities typically receive investment grade\ncredit ratings at the time of issuance. These\nratings are generally achieved through the\ncreation of lower-rated subordinated classes\nof asset-backed securities, as well as\nsubordinated or residual interests. In certain\ncases, we may retain a portion or all of the\nsecurities issued, interest-only strips, one\nor more subordinated tranches, servicing\nrights and, in some cases, cash reserve\naccounts. Securitized loans are removed from\nthe balance sheet and a net gain or loss is\nrecognized in Noninterest income at the time\nof initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on\nthe sale of the loans depend on the fair value\nof the loans sold and the retained interests\nat the date of sale. We generally estimate the\nfair value of the retained interests based on\nthe present value of future expected cash\nflows using assumptions as to discount rates,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, credit\nlosses and servicing costs, if applicable.\nWith the exception of loan sales to certain\nU.S. government-chartered entities, our loan\nsales and securitizations are generally\nstructured without recourse to us except for\nrepresentations and warranties and with no\nrestrictions on the retained interests. We\noriginate, sell and service commercial\nmortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program.\nUnder the provisions of the DUS program, we\nparticipate in a loss-sharing arrangement with\nFNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing\nor recourse, our policy is to record such\nliabilities initially at fair value and\nsubsequently reserve for estimated losses in\naccordance with guidance contained in\napplicable GAAP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited\nliability company, or any other legal\nstructure used to conduct activities or hold\nassets generally that either:\n\u2022 Does not have equity investors with voting\nrights that can directly or indirectly make\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s most significant\neconomic activities through those voting\nrights or similar rights, or\n\u2022 Has equity investors that do not provide\nsufficient equity for the entity to finance\nits activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support.\nA VIE often holds financial assets, including\nloans or receivables, real estate or other\nproperty.\nVIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC\n810 \u2013 Consolidation when we hold a variable\ninterest in these entities. We consolidate a\nVIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The\nprimary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to\nbe the party that meets both of the following\ncriteria: (i) has the power to make decisions\nthat most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE; and (ii) has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Upon\nconsolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of\nthe VIE\u2019s assets, liabilities and\nnoncontrolling interests on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we\ndetermine whether any changes occurred\nrequiring a reassessment of whether we are the\nprimary beneficiary of an entity.\nSee Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities\nand Variable Interest Entities for information\nabout VIEs that we consolidate as well as\nthose that we do not consolidate but in which\nwe hold a significant variable interest.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe provide servicing under various loan\nservicing contracts for commercial and\nresidential loans. These contracts are either\npurchased in the open market or retained as\npart of a loan securitization or loan sale.\nAll acquired or originated servicing rights\nare measured at fair value. Fair value is\nbased on the present value of the expected\nfuture net cash flows, including assumptions\nas to:\n\u2022 Deposit balances and interest rates for\nescrow and commercial reserve earnings,\n\u2022 Discount rates,\n\u2022 Estimated prepayment speeds, and\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 105\n\u2022 Estimated servicing costs.\n\nWe measure commercial and residential MSRs at\nfair value in order to reduce any potential\nmeasurement mismatch between our economic\nhedges and the MSRs. We manage the risk by\nhedging the fair value of MSRs with\nderivatives and securities which are expected\nto increase in value when the value of the\nservicing right declines. Changes in the fair\nvalue of MSRs are recognized as\ngains/(losses). The fair value of these\nservicing rights is estimated by using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation model which\ncalculates the present value of estimated\nfuture net servicing cash flows, taking into\nconsideration actual and expected mortgage\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nSee Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions\nrepresents the value attributable to\nunidentifiable intangible elements in the\nbusiness acquired. At least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events\noccur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date,\nmanagement performs the goodwill impairment\ntest at a reporting unit level.\nPNC may first perform a qualitative analysis\nto evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. If, after\nconsidering all relevant events and\ncircumstances, PNC determines it is not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, then performing a quantitative\nimpairment test is not necessary. If PNC\nelects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or\nconcludes via qualitative analysis that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest is performed. Inputs are generated and\nused in calculating the fair value of the\nreporting unit, which is compared to its\ncarrying amount. The fair value of our\nreporting units is determined by using\ndiscounted cash flows and/or market\ncomparability methodologies. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying amount, an entity should recognize an\nimpairment charge for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of goodwill exceeds the\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value. The loss\nrecognized should not exceed the total amount\nof goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nSee Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing\nRights for additional information.\n\nLeases\nLessor Arrangements\nWe provide financing for various types of\nequipment, including aircraft, energy and\npower systems and vehicles through a variety\nof lease arrangements. Finance leases are\ncarried at the aggregate of lease payments\nplus estimated residual value of the leased\nequipment, less unearned income. Leveraged\nleases, a form of financing leases, are\ncarried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize\nincome over the term of the lease using the\nconstant effective yield method. Lease\nresidual values are reviewed for impairment at\nleast annually. Gains or losses on the sale of\nleased assets are included in Other\nnoninterest income. Valuation adjustments on\noperating lease residuals are included in\nOther noninterest expense while valuation\nadjustments on the net investment of a direct\nfinancing or sales-type lease are included in\nProvision for credit losses. Prior to the\nadoption of CECL, valuation adjustments on\nlease residuals were included in Other\nnoninterest expense.\nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office\nspace, land and equipment under operating and\nfinance leases. Under ASC 842, we elected the\npractical expedient to account for the lease\nand nonlease components of real estate leases\nand leases of advertising assets, such as\nsignage, as a single lease component. For\nother leased asset classes, lease and nonlease\ncomponents of new lease agreements are\naccounted for separately. In addition, we\nelected the practical expedient to not apply\nthe recognition requirements under the\nstandard to short-term leases. Leases with an\ninitial term of 12 months or less are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize\nlease expense for these leases on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term. Generally, we\nhave elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap\nrate corresponding to the term of the lease at\nthe lease measurement date as our incremental\nborrowing rate to measure the right-of-use-\nasset and lease liability.\nSee Note 7 Leases for additional information\non our leasing arrangements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor financial reporting purposes, we\ndepreciate premises and equipment, net of\nsalvage value, principally using the straight-\nline method over their estimated useful lives.\nWe use estimated useful lives for furniture\nand equipment ranging from oneto 10years, and\ndepreciate buildings over an estimated useful\nlife of up to 40years. We amortize leasehold\nimprovements over their estimated useful lives\nof up to 15years or the respective lease\nterms, whichever is shorter.\n106 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nWe purchase, as well as internally develop and\ncustomize, certain software to enhance or\nperform internal business functions. Software\ndevelopment costs incurred in the planning and\npost-development project stages are charged to\nNoninterest expense. Costs associated with\ndesigning software configuration and\ninterfaces, installation, coding programs and\ntesting systems are capitalized and amortized\nusing the straight-line method over periods\nranging from oneto 10years.\n\nWe review the remaining useful lives and\ncarrying values of premises and equipment to\ndetermine whether an event has occurred that\nwould indicate a change in useful life is\nwarranted or if any impairment exists.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income, on an after-tax\nbasis, primarily consists of unrealized gains\nor losses on debt securities, unrealized gains\nor losses on derivatives designated as cash\nflow hedges, and changes in plan assets and\nbenefit obligations of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans. Details of each\ncomponent are included in Note 13 Other\nComprehensive Income.\nTreasury Stock\nWe record common stock purchased for treasury\nat cost. At the date of subsequent reissue,\nthe treasury stock account is reduced by the\ncost of such stock on the first-in, first-out\nbasis.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated\nusing the two-class method to determine income\nattributable to common shareholders. Unvested\nshare-based payment awards that contain\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents are considered participating\nsecurities under the two-class method.\nDistributed dividends and dividend equivalents\nrelated to participating securities and an\nallocation of undistributed net income to\nparticipating securities reduce the amount of\nincome attributable to common shareholders. In\na period with a loss, no allocation will be\nmade to the participating securities, as they\ndo not have a contractual obligation to absorb\nlosses. Income attributable to common\nshareholders is then divided by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding for the\nperiod.\nDiluted earnings per common share is\ncalculated under the more dilutive of either\nthe treasury method or the two-class method.\nFor the diluted calculation, we increase the\nweighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding by the assumed conversion of\noutstanding convertible preferred stock from\nthe beginning of the year or date of issuance,\nif later, and the number of shares of common\nstock that would be issued assuming the\nexercise of stock options and warrants and the\nissuance of incentive shares using the\ntreasury stock method. These adjustments to\nthe weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding are made only when\nsuch adjustments will dilute earnings per\ncommon share. For periods in which there is a\nloss from continuing operations, any potential\ndilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this\nscenario, no potential dilutive shares will be\nincluded in the continuing operations,\ndiscontinued operations or total earnings per\ncommon share calculations, even if overall net\nincome is reported. See Note 14 Earnings Per\nShare for additional information.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments and\nthe methods and assumptions used in estimating\nfair value amounts and financial assets and\nliabilities for which fair value was elected\nare detailed in Note 15 Fair Value.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to\nboth mitigate exposure to market (primarily\ninterest rate) and credit risks inherent in\nour business activities, as well as to\nfacilitate customer risk management\nactivities. We manage these risks as part of\nour asset and liability management process and\nthrough credit policies and procedures.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments at\nfair value as either Other assets or Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nand the related cash flows in the Operating\nActivities section of the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for\ncounterparty credit risk are included in the\ndetermination of fair value. The accounting\nfor changes in the fair value of a derivative\ninstrument depends on whether it has been\ndesignated and qualifies as part of a cash\nflow or net investment hedging relationship.\nFor all other derivatives, changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in earnings.\nWe utilize a net presentation for derivative\ninstruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ntaking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash collateral exchanged with counterparties\nis also netted against the applicable\nderivative exposures by offsetting obligations\nto return, or general rights to reclaim, cash\ncollateral against the fair values of the net\nderivatives being collateralized.\nFor those derivative instruments that are\ndesignated and qualify as accounting hedges,\nwe designate the hedging instrument, based on\nthe exposure being hedged, as a fair value\nhedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net\ninvestment in a foreign operation.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 107\nWe formally document the relationship between\nthe hedging instruments and hedged items, as\nwell as the risk management objective and\nstrategy, before undertaking an accounting\nhedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the\nderivatives and related hedged items must be\ndesignated as a hedge at inception of the\nhedge relationship. In addition, a derivative\nmust be highly effective at reducing the risk\nassociated with the exposure being hedged. For\naccounting hedge relationships, we formally\nassess, both at the inception of the hedge and\non an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are\nhighly effective in offsetting designated\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item. If it is determined that the\nderivative instrument is not highly effective,\nhedge accounting is discontinued. We assess\neffectiveness using statistical regression\nanalysis. Where the critical terms of the\nderivative and hedged item match,\neffectiveness may be assessed qualitatively.\n\nFor derivatives that are designated as fair\nvalue hedges ( i.e ., hedging the exposure to\nchanges in the fair value of an asset or a\nliability attributable to a particular risk,\nsuch as changes in benchmark interest rates),\nchanges in the fair value of the hedging\ninstrument are recognized in earnings and\noffset by also recognizing in earnings the\nchanges in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk. To the extent\nthe change in fair value of the derivative\ndoes not offset the change in fair value of\nthe hedged item, the difference is reflected\nin the Consolidated Income Statement in the\nsame income statement line as the hedged item.\n\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges\n( i.e ., hedging the exposure to variability\nin expected future cash flows), the gain or\nloss on derivatives is reported as a component\nof AOCI and subsequently reclassified to\nincome in the same period or periods during\nwhich the hedged cash flows affect earnings\nand recorded in the same income statement line\nitem as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives\ndesignated as a hedge of net investment in a\nforeign operation, the gain or loss on the\nderivatives is reported as a component of\nAOCI.\n\nWe discontinue hedge accounting when it is\ndetermined that the derivative no longer\nqualifies as an effective hedge; the\nderivative expires or is sold, terminated or\nexercised; or the derivative is de-designated\nas a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a\ncash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that\nthe forecasted transaction will occur by the\nend of the originally specified time period.\nWe purchase or originate financial instruments\nthat contain an embedded derivative. For\nfinancial instruments not measured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings, we assess, at inception of the\ntransaction, if the economic characteristics\nof the embedded derivative are clearly and\nclosely related to the economic\ncharacteristics of the host contract, and\nwhether a separate instrument with the same\nterms as the embedded derivative would be a\nderivative. If the embedded derivative is not\nclearly and closely related to the host\ncontract and meets the definition of a\nderivative, the embedded derivative is\nrecorded separately from the host contract\nwith changes in fair value recorded in\nearnings, unless we elect to account for the\nhybrid instrument at fair value.\n\nWe enter into commitments to originate\nresidential and commercial mortgage loans for\nsale. We also enter into commitments to\npurchase or sell commercial and residential\nreal estate loans. These commitments are\naccounted for as free-standing derivatives\nwhich are recorded at fair value in Other\nassets or Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss\nfrom the change in fair value after the\ninception of the commitment is recognized in\nNoninterest income.\n\nSee Note 16 Financial Derivatives for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset\nand liability method. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities and\nare measured using the enacted tax rates and\nlaws that we expect will apply at the time\nwhen we believe the differences will reverse.\nChanges in tax rates and tax law are accounted\nfor in the period of enactment. Thus, at the\nenactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured\nand the change is recognized in Income Tax\nexpense. The recognition of deferred tax\nassets requires an assessment to determine the\nrealization of such assets. Realization refers\nto the incremental benefit achieved through\nthe reduction in future taxes payable or\nrefunds receivable from the deferred tax\nassets, assuming that the underlying\ndeductible differences and carryforwards are\nthe last items to enter into the determination\nof future taxable income. We establish a\nvaluation allowance for tax assets when it is\nmore likely than not that they will not be\nrealized, based upon all available positive\nand negative evidence.\nWe use the proportional amortization method\nfor LIHTC investments, whereby the associated\ninvestment tax credits are recognized as a\nreduction to tax expense. We use the deferral\nmethod of accounting for all other tax credit\ninvestments. Under this method, the investment\ntax credits are recognized as a reduction to\nthe related asset.\n108 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn interest and noninterest income from\nvarious sources, including:\n\u2022 Lending,\n\u2022 Securities portfolio,\n\u2022 Asset management,\n\u2022 Loan sales, loan securitizations, and\nservicing,\n\u2022 Brokerage services,\n\u2022 Sale of loans and securities,\n\u2022 Certain private equity activities, and\n\u2022 Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange\nactivities.\nIn addition, we earn fees and commissions\nfrom:\n\u2022 Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of\ncredit and financial guarantees,\n\u2022 Deposit account services,\n\u2022 Merchant services,\n\u2022 Selling various insurance products,\n\u2022 Providing treasury management services\nincluding money transfer services,\n\u2022 Providing merger and acquisition advisory\nand related services,\n\u2022 Debit and credit card transactions, and\n\u2022 Participating in certain capital markets\ntransactions.\nService charges on deposit accounts are\nrecognized when earned. Brokerage fees and\ngains and losses on the sale of securities and\ncertain derivatives are recognized on a trade-\ndate basis.\nWe record private equity income or loss based\non changes in the valuation of the underlying\ninvestments or when we dispose of our\ninterest.\nWe recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the\nfair value of certain financial instruments\nwhere we have elected the fair value option.\nThese financial instruments include certain\ncommercial and residential mortgage loans\noriginated for sale, certain residential\nmortgage portfolio loans and resale\nagreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on\nchanges in the fair value of residential and\ncommercial MSRs.\nWe recognize revenue from servicing\nresidential mortgages, commercial mortgages\nand other consumer loans for others as earned\nbased on the specific contractual terms. These\nrevenues are reported on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement in the line items Residential\nmortgage, Corporate services and Consumer\nservices. We recognize revenue from\nsecurities, derivatives and foreign exchange\ncustomer-related trading, as well as\nsecurities underwriting activities, as these\ntransactions occur or as services are\nprovided. We generally recognize gains from\nthe sale of loans upon meeting the\nderecognition criteria for transfers of\nfinancial assets. Mortgage revenue recognized\nis reported net of mortgage repurchase\nreserves.\nFor the fee-based revenue within the scope of\nASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers , revenue is recognized when or as\nthose services are transferred to the\ncustomer. See Note 24 Fee-Based Revenue from\nContracts with Customers for additional\ninformation related to revenue within the\nscope of ASC 606.\nDiscontinued Operations\nA disposal of an asset or business that meets\nthe criteria for held for sale classification\nis reported as discontinued operations when\nthe disposal represents a strategic shift that\nhas had, or will have a major effect on our\noperating results. We report an asset as held\nfor sale when management has approved or\nreceived approval to sell the asset and is\ncommitted to a formal plan, the asset is\navailable for immediate sale, the asset is\nbeing actively marketed, the sale is\nanticipated to occur during the ensuing year\nand certain other specified criteria are met.\nAn asset classified as held for sale is\nrecorded at the lower of its carrying amount\nor estimated fair value less cost to sell. If\nthe carrying amount of the asset exceeds its\nestimated fair value, the asset is written\ndown to its fair value upon the held for sale\ndesignation.\nWhen presenting discontinued operations,\nassets classified as held for sale are\nsegregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\ncommencing in the period in which the asset\nmeets all of the held for sale criteria\ndescribed above and prior periods are recast.\nThe results of discontinued operations are\nreported in discontinued operations in the\nConsolidated Income Statement for current and\nprior periods commencing in the period in\nwhich the asset or business is either disposed\nof or is classified as held for sale,\nincluding any gain or loss recognized on the\nsale or adjustment of the carrying amount to\nfair value less cost to sell.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 109\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022                            \n                 Simplifies                   \n                 the                          \n                 accounting                   \n                 for income                   \n                 taxes by                     \n                 eliminating                  \n                 certain                      \n                 exceptions                   \n                 in ASC                       \n                 740,Income                   \n                 Taxes,                       \n                 relating to                  \n                 the                          \n                 approach                     \n                 for                          \n                 intraperiod                  \n                 tax                          \n                 allocation,    \u2022 Adopted     \n                 the            January 1,    \n                 recognition    2021.         \n                 of deferred    \u2022 The         \n                 tax            adoption of   \n                 liabilities    this          \n                 for outside    standard did  \n                 basis          not impact    \n                 differences    our           \n                 and the        consolidated  \n                 methodology    results of    \n                 for            operations    \n                 calculating    or our        \n                 income         consolidated  \n                 taxes in an    financial     \n  Income Tax     interim        position.     \n  Simplifica\u2026    period.

PNC did not acquire the\nfollowing entities as part of the acquisition:\nBBVA Securities, Inc., Propel Venture Partners\nFund I, L.P. and BBVA Processing Services,\nInc. This transaction has been accounted for\nas a business combination. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA were recorded\nat fair value as of the acquisition date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA are subject\nto adjustment for up to one year after the\nclosing date of the acquisition as additional\ninformation becomes available. Valuations\nsubject to adjustment include, but are not\nlimited to, loans, certain deposits, certain\nother assets, customer relationships and core\ndeposit intangibles.\n\nOn October 12, 2021, PNC converted\napproximately 2.6million customers,\n9,000employees and over 600branches across\nsevenstates, merging BBVA USA into PNC Bank.\n\nPNC incurred merger and integration costs of $\n798million for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2021, in connection with the\ntransaction. These costs are recorded as\ncontra-revenue and expense on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. The integration expenses are\nprimarily related to personnel, technology,\nadvisory and legal, with $ 52million direct\nacquisition-related costs.

The prices are adjusted\nas\n\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain similar loans.\n\nPersonal installment loans are pooled based on\ndelinquency status, and fair value of\nindividual loans is calculated based on traded\n\nconsumer unsecured loans, dealer research and\nloan level performance characteristics.\n\nAvailable For Sale Securities\n\nAll investment securities from the BBVA\nacquisition were classified within the\navailable for sale portfolio at acquisition.\nFair value\n\nestimates for available for sale securities\nwere determined by third-party pricing\nvendors. The third-party vendors use a variety\nof\n\nmethods when pricing securities that\nincorporate relevant market data to arrive at\nan estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace\n\nwould pay for a security under current market\nconditions. These methods include the use of\nquoted prices for the identical or a similar\n\nsecurity, an alternative market-based approach\nor an income approach, such as a discounted\ncash flow pricing model.\n\nLoans\n\nFair value for loans is based on a discounted\ncash flow methodology that considered credit\nloss and prepayment expectations, market\n\ninterest rates and other market factors, such\nas liquidity, from the perspective of a market\nparticipant. Loan cash flows were generated\n\non an individual loan basis. The PD, LGD,\nexposure at default and prepayment assumptions\nare the key factors driving credit losses\n\nwhich are embedded into the estimated cash\nflows.\n\n112 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments primarily include LIHTC\ninvestments and preservation fund investments.\nThe fair value of the LIHTC investments\n\nwas estimated based on LIHTC pricing observed\nfor recent transactions in markets where the\nproperties underlying the LIHTC\n\ninvestments from the BBVA acquisition are\nlocated. The fair value of the preservation\ninvestments was estimated based on appraisals\n\nand valuations of the properties in the\ninvestment portfolio using income and market\nprojections.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe fair value of mortgage servicing rights\nfrom the BBVA acquisition is estimated by\nusing a discounted cash flow valuation model\n\nwhich calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows,\ntaking into consideration actual and expected\nmortgage\n\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\n\nCore Deposit Intangible\n\nThis intangible asset represents the value of\ncertain client deposit relationships. The fair\nvalue was estimated utilizing the cost method.\n\nAppropriate consideration was given to deposit\ncosts including servicing costs, client\nretention and alternative funding source costs\nat\n\nthe time of acquisition. The discount rate\nused was derived taking into account the\nestimated cost of equity, risk-free return\nrate and\n\nrisk premium for the market and specific risk\nrelated to the asset\u2019s cash flows. The core\ndeposit intangible is being amortized over\n10years using an accelerated depreciation\nmethodology.\n\nDeposits\n\nThe fair values for time deposits were\nestimated by discounting contractual cash\nflows using current market rates for\ninstruments with\n\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, carrying values approximate\nfair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nThe fair values of long-term debt instruments\nwere estimated based on quoted market prices.\nThe following table presents financial results\nof BBVA from the date of acquisition through\nSeptember 30, 2021.

PNC considers a variety of\nfactors in connection with the identification\nof more-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality, including but not limited to\nnonperforming status, delinquency, risk\nratings, TDR classification, FICO scores and\nother qualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. PNC initially measures the\namortized cost of a PCD loan by adding the\nacquisition date estimate of expected credit\nlosses to the loan's purchase price. The\ninitial ACL for PCD loans of $ 1.1billion was\nestablished through an adjustment to the BBVA\nloan balance and related purchase accounting\nmark.

As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the allowance for\ninvestment securities was $ 133million and\n\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2020 was $ 82million. The\nprovision for credit losses on investment\nsecurities was $ 51million and $ 80million for\nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. See Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies for a discussion of the methodologies\nused to determine the allowance for investment\nsecurities.\n\nTable 46 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at December 31, 2021\nand 2020.

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 50 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. We manage credit\nrisk based on the risk profile of the\nborrower, repayment sources, underlying\ncollateral and other support given current\nevents, economic conditions and expectations.\nWe refine our practices to meet the changing\nenvironment and the continuing effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance.\n\nAs a result, under the CARES Act credit\nreporting rules, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020 based on the contractual terms of the\nloan, even where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period. Loan modifications due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships that permanently\nreduce either the contractual interest rate or\nthe principal balance of a loan do not qualify\nfor TDR relief under the CARES Act or the\ninteragency guidance.\n\n118 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\nTable 50: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) (b)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table represent loans held for\ninvestment and do not include any associated\nALLL.\n(b) The accrued interest associated with our\nloan portfolio totaled $ 0.7billion at both\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.

Such credit arrangements are\nusually designed to match borrower cash flow\n\nexpectations (e.g., working capital lines,\nrevolvers). These products are standard in the\nfinancial services industry and product\nfeatures are considered during the\nunderwriting process to mitigate the increased\nrisk that the interest-only feature may result\nin borrowers not\n\nbeing able to make interest and principal\npayments when due.

TDRs\nthat are performing, including consumer credit\ncard TDR loans, totaled $ 0.6billion and $\n0.7billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and\nare excluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nAdditional Credit Quality Indicators by Loan\nClass\n\nCommercial and Industrial\n\nFor commercial and industrial loans, we\nmonitor the performance of the borrower in a\ndisciplined and regular manner based upon the\nlevel of credit risk inherent in the loan. To\nevaluate the level of credit risk, we assign\nan internal risk rating reflecting the\nborrower\u2019s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional\ncredit risk rating methodology provides\ngranularity in the risk monitoring process.\nThese ratings are reviewed and updated,\ngenerally at least once per year. For small\nbalance homogeneous pools of commercial and\nindustrial loans and leases, we apply scoring\ntechniques to assist in determining the PD.\nThe combination of the PD and LGD ratings\nassigned to commercial and industrial loans,\ncapturing both the combination of expectations\nof default and loss severity in the event of\ndefault, reflects credit quality\ncharacteristics as of the reporting date and\nare used as inputs into our loss forecasting\nprocess.\n\nBased upon the amount of the lending\narrangement and our risk rating assessment, we\nfollow a formal schedule of written periodic\nreviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews\nof a market\u2019s or business unit\u2019s loan\nportfolio, focusing on those loans which we\nperceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs\nand LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is\nweakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our\npractice to review any customer obligation and\nits level of credit risk more frequently. We\nattempt to proactively manage our loans by\nusing various procedures that are customized\nto the risk of a given loan, including ongoing\noutreach, contact, and assessment of obligor\nfinancial conditions, collateral inspection\nand appraisal.\n\n120 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate projects and commercial\nmortgages similar to commercial and industrial\nloans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks\nassociated with commercial real estate\nprojects and commercial mortgage activities\ntend to be correlated to the loan structure\nand collateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. As a result, these\nattributes are also monitored and utilized in\nassessing credit risk.\n\nAs with the commercial and industrial loan\nclass, a formal schedule of periodic reviews\nis also performed to assess market/geographic\nrisk and business unit/industry risk. Often as\na result of these reviews, more in-depth\nreviews and increased scrutiny are placed on\nareas of higher risk, such as adverse changes\nin risk ratings, deteriorating operating\ntrends, and/or areas that concern management.\nThese reviews are designed to assess risk and\nfacilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\n\nEquipment Lease Financing\n\nWe manage credit risk associated with our\nequipment lease financing loan class similar\nto commercial and industrial loans by\nanalyzing PD and LGD.\n\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and\nthe level of credit risk, we follow a formal\nschedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this\noccurs quarterly, although we have established\npractices to review such credit risk more\nfrequently if circumstances warrant. Our\nreview process entails analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual\nvalue, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk,\nindustry risk, guarantor requirements and\nregulatory compliance as applicable.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 121\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the commercial loan classes:\nTable 52: Commercial Credit Quality Indicators\n(a)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Loans in our commercial portfolio are\nclassified as Pass Rated or Criticized based\non the regulatory definitions, which are\ndriven by the PD and LGD ratings that we\nassign. The Criticized classification includes\nloans that were rated special mention,\nsubstandard or doubtful as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020.\nResidential Real Estate and Home Equity\n\nWe use several credit quality indicators,\nincluding delinquency information,\nnonperforming loan information, updated credit\nscores and originated and updated LTV ratios,\nto monitor and manage credit risk within the\nresidential real estate and home equity loan\nclasses. A summary of credit quality\nindicators follows:\n\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor\ntrending of delinquency/delinquency rates for\nresidential real estate and home equity loans.\nSee Table 50 for additional information.\n\nNonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of\nnonperforming loans for residential real\nestate and home equity loans. See Table 50 for\nadditional information.\n\n122 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nCredit Scores: We use a national third-party\nprovider to update FICO credit scores for\nresidential real estate and home equity loans\nat least quarterly. The updated scores are\nincorporated into a series of credit\nmanagement reports, which are utilized to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and\nsubordinate lien positions): At least\nquarterly, we update the property values of\nreal estate collateral and calculate an\nupdated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines\nsecured by real estate in regions experiencing\nsignificant declines in property values, more\nfrequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV\nmigration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\n\nWe use a combination of original LTV and\nupdated LTV for internal risk management and\nreporting purposes ( e.g. , line management,\nloss mitigation strategies). In addition to\nthe fact that estimated property values by\ntheir nature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that\nupdated LTVs may be based upon management\u2019s\nassumptions ( i.e. , if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider,\nHPI changes will be incorporated in arriving\nat management\u2019s estimate of updated LTV).\n\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled\nproperty values. The related estimates and\ninputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation\nmodels, broker price opinions, HPI indices,\nproperty location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and\nmanagement assumptions. We generally utilize\norigination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include\nan amortization assumption when calculating\nupdated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the\ncalculations do not represent actual appraised\nloan level collateral or updated LTV based\nupon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to\nchange as we refine our methodology.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 123\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the residential real estate and\nhome equity loan classes:\n\nTable 53: Credit Quality Indicators for\nResidential Real Estate and Home Equity Loan\nClasses\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n124 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer\n\nWe monitor a variety of credit quality\ninformation in the management of these\nconsumer loan classes.

Internal credit\nmetrics, such as delinquency status, are\nheavily relied upon as credit quality\nindicators for government guaranteed or\ninsured education loans and consumer loans to\nhigh net worth individuals, as internal credit\nmetrics are more relevant than FICO scores for\nthese types of loans.\n\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency\ntrends and losses for each class, FICO credit\nscore updates are obtained at least quarterly\nalong with a variety of credit bureau\nattributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend\nto have a lower likelihood of loss.\nConversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to\nhave a higher likelihood of loss.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 125\nThe following table presents credit quality\nindicators for the automobile, credit card,\neducation and other consumer loan classes:\n\nTable 54: Credit Quality Indicators for\nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other\nConsumer Loan Classes\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n126 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Loans with no FICO score available or\nrequired generally refers to new accounts\nissued to borrowers with limited credit\nhistory, accounts for which we cannot obtain\nan updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile\nchanges), cards issued with a business name\nand/or cards secured by collateral. Management\nproactively assesses the risk and size of this\nloan category and, when necessary, takes\nactions to mitigate the credit risk.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. Loans that have been\nrestructured for COVID-19 related hardships\nand meet certain criteria under the CARES Act\nare not categorized as TDRs. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies for additional information\nrelated to TDRs.\n\nTable 55 quantifies the number of loans that\nwere classified as TDRs as well as the change\nin the loans\u2019 balance as a result of becoming\na TDR during 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAdditionally, the table provides information\nabout the types of TDR concessions. The\nPrincipal Forgiveness TDR category includes\nprincipal forgiveness and accrued interest\nforgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category\nincludes reduced interest rate and interest\ndeferral. The Other TDR category primarily\nincludes consumer borrowers that have been\ndischarged from personal liability through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally\nreaffirmed their loan obligations to us, as\nwell as postponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and contractual extensions for\nboth consumer and commercial borrowers.\n\nIn some cases, there have been multiple\nconcessions granted on one loan. This is most\ncommon within the commercial loan portfolio.\nWhen there have been multiple concessions\ngranted in the commercial loan portfolio, the\nprincipal forgiveness concession was\nprioritized for purposes of determining the\ninclusion in Table 55. Second in priority\nwould be rate reduction. In the event that\nmultiple concessions are granted on a consumer\nloan, concessions resulting from discharge\nfrom personal liability through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy without formal affirmation of the\nloan obligations to us would be prioritized\nand included in the Other type of concession\nin Table 55. After that, consumer loan\nconcessions would follow the previously\ndiscussed priority of concessions for the\ncommercial loan portfolio.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 127\nTable 55: Financial Impact and TDRs by\nConcession Type\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n(a) Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date\nis included in this table.\n(b) Represents the amortized cost basis of the\nloans as of the quarter end prior to TDR\ndesignation.\n(c) Represents the amortized cost basis of the\nTDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the\nTDR occurs.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n(d) Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date\nare included in this table.\n(e) Represents the recorded investment of the\nloans as of the quarter end prior to TDR\ndesignation, and excludes immaterial amounts\nof accrued interest receivable.\n(f) Represents the recorded investment of the\nTDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the\nTDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of\naccrued interest receivable.\n\nAfter a loan is determined to be a TDR, we\ncontinue to track its performance under its\nmost recent restructured terms.

The following summarizes the\nchanges in these factors that influenced the\ncurrent ACL during the year ended December 31,\n2021:\n\n\u2022 Portfolio changes that drove reserve\ndeclines included improvements in credit\nquality along with changes in portfolio\ncomposition reflecting both shifts in the\nportfolio mix and declines in certain loan\nbalances.\n\n\u2022 The improved economic environment was\nreflected in both the forecasted economic\nscenarios utilized in the quantitative models\nand the qualitative factor reserves. The\neconomic scenarios used at December 31, 2021\nwere primarily driven by improvements in the\noutlook for both consumer spending and the\nlabor market. Reductions in qualitative factor\nreserves reflect the improved economic\nenvironment's impact on specific high risk\nindustries.\n\n\u2022 Reserves in the current period reflect\nexpected credit losses within the acquired\nBBVA loan portfolio.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nPrior to January 1, 2020, we maintained our\nALLL at levels we believed to be appropriate\nto absorb estimated probable credit losses\nincurred in the portfolios as of the balance\nsheet date. We used the two main portfolio\nsegments - Commercial and Consumer, and\ndeveloped and documented the ALLL under\nseparate methodologies for each of these\nportfolio segments.\n\nA rollforward of the

CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nWe have transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement. These transfers have occurred\nthrough Agency securitization, Non-agency\nsecuritization, and loan sale transactions.\nAgency securitizations consist of\nsecuritization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC\nand GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA\nand FHLMC generally securitize our transferred\nloans into mortgage-backed securities for sale\ninto the secondary market through SPEs that\nthey sponsor. As an authorized GNMA\nissuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of\nVA insured loans into mortgage-backed\nsecurities for sale into the secondary market.\nIn Non-agency securitizations, we have\ntransferred loans into securitization SPEs. In\nother instances, third-party investors have\nalso purchased our loans in loan sale\ntransactions and in certain instances have\nsubsequently sold these loans into\nsecuritization SPEs. Securitization SPEs\nutilized in the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization transactions are VIEs.\n\nOur continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC,\nand GNMA securitizations, Non-agency\nsecuritizations, and loan sale transactions\ngenerally consists of servicing, repurchasing\npreviously transferred loans under certain\nconditions and loss share arrangements, and,\nin limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the securitization\nSPEs.\n\nDepending on the transaction, we may act as\nthe master, primary and/or special servicer to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors. Servicing responsibilities\ntypically consist of collecting and remitting\nmonthly borrower principal and interest\npayments, maintaining escrow deposits,\nperforming loss mitigation and foreclosure\nactivities, and, in certain instances, funding\nof servicing advances. Servicing advances,\nwhich are generally reimbursable, are made for\nprincipal and interest and collateral\nprotection and are carried in Other assets at\ncost.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 6 Goodwill and\nMortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair\nValue for further discussion of our servicing\nrights.\n\nCertain loans transferred to the Agencies\ncontain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an\noption to repurchase at par individual\ndelinquent loans that meet certain criteria.\nIn other limited cases, GNMA has granted us\nthe right to repurchase current loans when we\nintend to modify the borrower\u2019s interest rate\nunder established guidelines. When we have the\nunilateral ability to repurchase a loan,\neffective control over the loan has been\nregained and we recognize an asset (in either\nLoans or Loans held for sale) and a\ncorresponding liability (in Other borrowed\nfunds) on the balance sheet regardless of our\nintent to repurchase the loan.\n\nThe Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the securitization SPEs\nthat are purchased and held on our balance\nsheet are typically purchased in the secondary\nmarket. We do not retain any credit risk on\nour Agency mortgage-backed security positions\nas FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for\nGNMA) guarantee losses of principal and\ninterest.\n\nWe also have involvement with certain Agency\nand Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs\nwhere we have not transferred commercial\nmortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by\nindependent third-parties and the loans held\nby these entities were purchased exclusively\nfrom other third-parties. Generally, our\ninvolvement with these SPEs is as servicer\nwith servicing activities consistent with\nthose described above.\n\nWe recognize a liability for our loss exposure\nassociated with contractual obligations to\nrepurchase previously transferred loans due to\npossible breaches of representations and\nwarranties and also for loss sharing\narrangements (recourse obligations) with the\nAgencies. Other than providing temporary\nliquidity under servicing advances and our\nloss exposure associated with our repurchase\nand recourse obligations, we have not provided\nnor are we required to provide any type of\ncredit support, guarantees or commitments to\nthe securitization SPEs or third-party\ninvestors in these transactions.\n\n130 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe following table provides cash flows\nassociated with our loan sale and servicing\nactivities:\nTable 58: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities\n                                              \n  In                                          \n  mil\u2026                                        \n  Cash                                        \n  Flo\u2026                                        \n  -

In performing these\nassessments, we evaluate our level of\ncontinuing involvement in these transactions\nas the nature of our involvement ultimately\ndetermines whether or not we hold a variable\ninterest and/or are the primary beneficiary of\nthe SPE. Factors we consider in our\nconsolidation assessment include the\nsignificance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii)\nour holdings of mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the\nrights of third-party variable interest\nholders.\n\nThe first step in our assessment is to\ndetermine whether we hold a variable interest\nin the securitization SPE. We hold variable\ninterests in Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs through our holding of\nresidential and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the SPEs and/or our\nrecourse obligations. Each SPE in which we\nhold a variable interest is evaluated to\ndetermine whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of the entity. For Agency\nsecuritization transactions, our contractual\nrole as servicer does not give us the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly\naffect the economic performance of the SPEs.\nThus, we are not the primary beneficiary of\nthese entities. For Non-agency securitization\ntransactions, we would be the primary\nbeneficiary to the extent our servicing\nactivities give us the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the SPE and we hold a\nmore-than-insignificant variable interest in\nthe entity.\n\nDetails about the Agency and Non-agency\nsecuritization SPEs where we hold a variable\ninterest and are not the primary beneficiary\nare included in Table 60. Our maximum exposure\nto loss as a result of our involvement with\nthese SPEs is the carrying value of the\nmortgage-backed securities, servicing assets,\nservicing advances and our liabilities\nassociated with our recourse obligations.\nCreditors of the securitization SPEs have no\nrecourse to our assets or general credit.\n\nTax Credit Investments and Other\n\nFor tax credit investments in which we do not\nhave the right to make decisions that will\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the entity, we are not the\nprimary beneficiary and thus do not\nconsolidate the entity. These investments are\ndisclosed in Table 60. The table also reflects\nour maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any\npotential tax credit recapture. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is equal to our legally\nbinding equity commitments adjusted for\nrecorded impairment, partnership results or\namortization for qualifying low income housing\ntax credit investments when applicable. For\nall legally binding unfunded equity\ncommitments, we increase our recognized\ninvestment and recognize a liability. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we had a liability for\nunfunded commitments of $ 2.0billion related\nto investments in qualified affordable housing\nprojects which is reflected in Other\nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTable 60 also includes our involvement in\nlease financing transactions with LLCs engaged\nin solar power generation that, to a large\nextent, provided returns in the form of tax\ncredits. The outstanding financings and\noperating lease assets are reflected as Loans\nand Other assets, respectively, on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, whereas related\nliabilities are reported in Deposits and Other\nliabilities.\n\n132 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nWe make certain equity investments in various\ntax credit limited partnerships or LLCs.

See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activities for\nadditional information.\n\nWe review goodwill in each of our reporting\nunits for impairment at least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events\noccur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date. Based\non the results of our analysis, there were\nnoimpairment charges related to goodwill in\n2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nWe recognize the right to service mortgage\nloans for others as an intangible asset when\nthe servicing income we receive is more than\nour projected servicing costs. MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 1.8billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and $ 1.2billion at December\n31, 2020, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages measured at fair value.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the\nfair value of commercial MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 64 and 65. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot\n\n134 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nbe extrapolated because the relationship of\nthe change in the assumption to the change in\nfair value may not be linear. Also, the effect\nof a variation in a particular assumption on\nthe fair value of the MSRs is calculated\nindependently without changing any other\nassumption. In reality, changes in one factor\nmay result in changes in another ( e.g. ,\nchanges in mortgage interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rate estimates,\ncould result in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions:\n\nTable 64: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key Valuation

Approximately 97% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass at December 31, 2021, with the\nremainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them. The standby\nletters of credit outstanding on December 31,\n2021 had terms ranging from less than one\nyearto eight years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, assets of $\n1.3billion secured certain specifically\nidentified standby letters of credit. In\naddition, a portion of the remaining standby\nletters of credit issued on behalf of specific\ncustomers is also secured by collateral or\nguarantees that secure the customers\u2019 other\nobligations to us. The carrying amount of the\nliability for our obligations related to\nstandby letters of credit and participations\nin standby letters of credit was $ 0.1billion\nat December 31, 2021 and is included

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate, and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. The three\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\n\u2022 Level 1: Fair value is determined using a\nquoted price in an active market for identical\nassets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and\nliabilities may include debt securities,\nequity securities and listed derivative\ncontracts that are traded in an active\nexchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that are actively traded in over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\n\u2022 Level 2: Fair value is estimated using\ninputs other than quoted prices included\nwithin Level 1 that are observable for assets\nor liabilities, either directly or indirectly.\nThe majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities\ninclude debt securities and listed derivative\ncontracts with quoted prices that are traded\nin markets that are not active, and certain\ndebt and equity securities and over-the-\ncounter derivative contracts whose fair value\nis determined using a pricing model without\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\n\u2022 Level 3: Fair value is estimated using\nunobservable inputs that are significant to\nthe fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities include\nfinancial instruments whose value is\ndetermined using pricing models and discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or similar techniques\nfor which the significant valuation inputs are\nnot observable and the determination of fair\nvalue requires significant management judgment\nor estimation.\n\nWe characterize active markets as those where\ntransaction volumes are sufficient to provide\nobjective pricing information, with reasonably\nnarrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer\nquotes received do not vary widely and are\nbased on current information. Inactive markets\nare typically characterized by low transaction\nvolumes, price quotations that vary\nsubstantially among market participants or are\nnot based on current information, wide bid/ask\nspreads, a significant increase in implied\nliquidity risk premiums, yields, or\nperformance indicators for observed\ntransactions or quoted prices compared to\nhistorical periods, a significant decline or\nabsence of a market for new issuance, or any\ncombination of the above factors. We also\nconsider nonperformance risks, including\ncredit risk, as part of our valuation\nmethodology for all assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value,\nby their nature, result in a higher degree of\nfinancial statement volatility. Assets and\nliabilities classified within Level 3\ninherently require the use of various\nassumptions, estimates and judgments when\nmeasuring their fair value. As observable\nmarket activity is commonly not available to\nuse when estimating the fair value of Level 3\nassets and liabilities, we must estimate fair\nvalue using various modeling techniques. These\ntechniques include the use of a variety of\ninputs/assumptions including credit quality,\nliquidity, interest rates or other relevant\ninputs across the entire population of our\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the\nsignificant underlying factors or assumptions\n(either an increase or a decrease) in any of\nthese areas underlying our estimates may have\nresulted in a significant increase/decrease in\nthe Level 3 fair value measurement of a\nparticular asset and/or liability from period\nto period.\n\nAny models used to determine fair values or to\nvalidate dealer quotes are subject to review\nand independent testing as part of our model\nvalidation and internal control testing\nprocesses. Our Model Risk Management Group\nreviews significant models on at least an\nannual basis. In addition, the Valuation\nCommittee approves valuation methodologies and\nreviews the results of independent valuation\nreviews and processes for assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain residential mortgage\nloans originated for sale at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. The election of the fair\nvalue option aligns the accounting for the\nresidential mortgages with the related hedges.\nResidential mortgage loans are valued based on\nquoted market prices, where available, prices\nfor other traded mortgage loans with similar\ncharacteristics, and purchase commitments and\nbid information received from market\nparticipants. The prices are adjusted as\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain loans that are priced based on the\npricing of similar loans. These adjustments\nrepresent unobservable inputs to the valuation\nbut are not considered significant given the\nrelative insensitivity of the value to changes\nin these inputs to the fair value of the\nloans. Accordingly, the majority of\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale are\nclassified as Level 2.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\n\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage\nloans classified as held for sale in whole\nloan transactions at fair value. We determine\nthe fair value of commercial mortgage loans\nheld for sale based upon discounted cash\nflows. Fair value is determined using sale\nvaluation assumptions that management believes\na market participant would use in pricing the\nloans.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 145\nValuation assumptions may include observable\ninputs based on the benchmark interest rate\nswap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales\ntransactions. The significant unobservable\ninput for commercial mortgage loans held for\nsale, excluding those to be sold to agencies,\nis management\u2019s assumption of the spread\napplied to the benchmark rate. The spread over\nthe benchmark curve includes management\u2019s\nassumptions of the impact of credit and\nliquidity risk. Significant increases\n(decreases) in the spread applied to the\nbenchmark would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower (higher) asset value. The\nwide range of the spread over the benchmark\ncurve is due to the varying risk and\nunderlying property characteristics within our\nportfolio. Based on the significance of the\nunobservable input we classified this\nportfolio as Level 3.\n\nFor loans to be sold to agencies with\nservicing retained, the fair value is adjusted\nfor the estimated servicing cash flows, which\nis an unobservable input. This adjustment is\nnot considered significant given the relative\ninsensitivity of the value to changes in the\ninput to the fair value of the loans.\nAccordingly, commercial mortgage loans held\nfor sale to agencies are classified as Level\n2.\n\nSecurities Available for Sale and Trading\nSecurities\n\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available for sale and trading\nportfolios. We primarily use prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes or recent\ntrades to determine the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of securities were\npriced by third-party vendors. The third-party\nvendors use a variety of methods when pricing\nsecurities that incorporate relevant market\ndata to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer\nin the marketplace would pay for a security\nunder current market conditions. We monitor\nand validate the reliability of vendor pricing\non an ongoing basis through pricing\nmethodology reviews, including detailed\nreviews of the assumptions and inputs used by\nthe vendor to price individual securities, and\nthrough price validation testing. Securities\nnot priced by one of our pricing vendors may\nbe valued using a dealer quote, which are also\nsubject to price validation testing. Price\nvalidation testing is performed independent of\nthe risk-taking function and involves\ncorroborating the prices received from third-\nparty vendors and dealers with prices from\nanother third party or through other sources,\nsuch as internal valuations or sales of\nsimilar securities. Security prices are also\nvalidated through actual cash settlement upon\nsale of a security.\n\nSecurities are classified within the fair\nvalue hierarchy after giving consideration to\nthe activity level in the market for the\nsecurity type and the observability of the\ninputs used to determine the fair value. When\na quoted price in an active market exists for\nthe identical security, this price is used to\ndetermine fair value and the security is\nclassified within Level 1 of the hierarchy.\nLevel 1 securities include U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\n\nWhen a quoted price in an active market for\nthe identical security is not available, fair\nvalue is estimated using either an alternative\nmarket approach, such as a recent trade or\nmatrix pricing, or an income approach, such as\na discounted cash flow pricing model. If the\ninputs to the valuation are based primarily on\nmarket observable information, then the\nsecurity is classified within Level 2 of the\nhierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency\ndebt securities, agency residential mortgage-\nbacked securities, agency and non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities, certain\nnon-agency residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities, asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by non-mortgage-related\ncorporate and consumer loans, and other debt\nsecurities. Level 2 securities are\npredominantly priced by third parties, either\nby a pricing vendor or dealer.\n\nIn certain cases where there is limited\nactivity or less transparency around the\ninputs to the valuation, securities are\nclassified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nSecurities classified as Level 3 consist\nprimarily of non-agency residential mortgage-\nbacked and asset-backed securities\ncollateralized by first- and second-lien\nresidential mortgage loans. Fair value for\nthese securities is primarily estimated using\npricing obtained from third-party vendors. In\nsome cases, fair value is estimated using a\ndealer quote, by reference to prices of\nsecurities of a similar vintage and collateral\ntype or by reference to recent sales of\nsimilar securities. Market activity for these\nsecurity types is limited with little price\ntransparency. As a result, these securities\nare generally valued by the third-party vendor\nusing a discounted cash flow approach that\nincorporates significant unobservable inputs\nand observable market activity where\navailable. Significant inputs to the valuation\ninclude prepayment projections and credit loss\nassumptions (default rate and loss severity)\nand discount rates that are deemed\nrepresentative of current market conditions.\nSignificant increases (decreases) in any of\nthose assumptions in isolation would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nCertain infrequently traded debt securities\nwithin Other debt securities available for\nsale and Trading securities are also\nclassified in Level 3 and are included in the\nInsignificant Level 3 assets, net of\nliabilities line item in Table 87. The\nsignificant unobservable inputs used to\nestimate the fair value of these securities\ninclude an estimate of expected credit losses\nand a discount for liquidity risk. These\ninputs are incorporated into the fair value\nmeasurement by either increasing the spread\nover the benchmark curve or by applying a\ncredit and liquidity discount to the par value\nof the security. Significant increases\n(decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk\ncould have resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value estimate.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans accounted for at fair value consist\nprimarily of residential mortgage loans. These\nloans are generally valued similarly to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale and\nare classified as Level 2. However, similar to\nresidential mortgage loans held for sale, if\nthese loans are repurchased and unsalable,\nthey are classified as Level 3. In addition,\nrepurchased VA loans, where only a portion of\nthe principal will be reimbursed, are\nclassified as Level 3. The fair value is\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation based on our historical loss rate.\nWe have elected to account for certain home\nequity lines of credit at fair value. These\nloans are classified as\n\n146 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nLevel 3. Significant inputs to the valuation\nof these loans include credit and liquidity\ndiscount, cumulative default rate, loss\nseverity and gross discount rate and are\ndeemed representative of current market\nconditions. Significant increases (decreases)\nin any of these assumptions would have\nresulted in a significantly lower (higher)\nfair value measurement.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments includes money market\nmutual funds as well as direct and indirect\nprivate equity investments. Money market\nmutual funds are valued based on quoted prices\nin active markets for identical securities and\nclassified within Level 1 of the hierarchy.\nThe valuation of direct and indirect private\nequity investments requires significant\nmanagement judgment due to the absence of\nquoted market prices, inherent lack of\nliquidity and the long-term nature of such\ninvestments. Various valuation techniques are\nused for direct investments, including\nmultiples of adjusted earnings of the entity,\nindependent appraisals, anticipated financing\nand sale transactions with third parties, or\nthe pricing used to value the entity in a\nrecent financing transaction. A multiple of\nadjusted earnings calculation is the valuation\ntechnique utilized most frequently and is the\nmost significant unobservable input used in\nsuch calculation. Significant decreases\n(increases) in the multiple of earnings could\nhave resulted in a significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement. Direct equity\ninvestments are classified as Level 3.\n\nIndirect investments are not redeemable;\nhowever, we receive distributions over the\nlife of the partnerships from liquidation of\nthe underlying investments by the investee,\nwhich we expect to occur over the next\n12years. We value indirect investments in\nprivate equity funds using the NAV practical\nexpedient as provided in the financial\nstatements that we receive from fund managers.\nDue to the time lag in our receipt of the\nfinancial information and based on a review of\ninvestments and valuation techniques applied,\nadjustments to the manager-provided value are\nmade when available recent portfolio company\ninformation or market information indicates a\nsignificant change in value from that provided\nby the manager of the fund. Indirect\ninvestments valued using NAV are not\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\n\nMSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs\nvaluation model reflect management\u2019s best\nestimate of factors that a market participant\nwould use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales\nof MSRs do occur and can offer some market\ninsight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open\nmarket with readily observable prices so the\nprecise terms and conditions of sales are not\navailable.\n\nResidential MSRs\n\nAs a benchmark for the reasonableness of our\nresidential MSRs fair value, we obtained\nopinions of value from independent brokers.\nThese brokers provided a range (+/- 10bps)\nbased upon their own discounted cash flow\ncalculations of our portfolio that reflect\nconditions in the secondary market and any\nrecently executed servicing transactions. We\ncompare our internally-developed residential\nMSRs value to the ranges of values received\nfrom the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair\nvalue falls outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges,\nmanagement will assess whether a valuation\nadjustment is warranted. For the periods\npresented, our residential MSRs value did not\nfall outside of the brokers\u2019 ranges. We\nconsider our residential MSRs value to\nrepresent a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n\nDue to the nature of the unobservable\nvaluation inputs, residential MSRs are\nclassified as Level 3. The significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement of residential MSRs are constant\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve. Significant increases (decreases) in\nprepayment rates and spread over the benchmark\ncurve would have resulted in lower (higher)\nfair market value of residential MSRs.\n\nCommercial MSRs\n\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated\nby using a discounted cash flow model\nincorporating unobservable inputs for\nassumptions such as constant prepayment rates,\ndiscount rates and other factors. Due to the\nnature of the unobservable valuation inputs\nand the limited availability of market\npricing, commercial MSRs are classified as\nLevel 3. Significant increases (decreases) in\nconstant prepayment rates and discount rates\nwould have resulted in significantly lower\n(higher) commercial MSR value determined based\non current market conditions and expectations.\n\nFinancial Derivatives\n\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued using\nquoted market prices and are classified as\nLevel 1. The majority of derivatives that we\nenter into are executed over-the-counter and\nare valued using internal models. These\nderivatives are primarily classified as Level\n2, as the readily observable market inputs to\nthese models are validated to external\nsources, such as industry pricing services, or\nare corroborated through recent trades, dealer\nquotes, yield curves, implied volatility or\nother market-related data. Level 2 financial\nderivatives are primarily estimated using a\ncombination of Eurodollar future prices and\nobservable benchmark interest rate swaps to\nconstruct projected discounted cash flows.\n\nFinancial derivatives that are priced using\nsignificant management judgment or assumptions\nare classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs\nrelated to interest rate contracts include\nprobability of funding of residential mortgage\nloan commitments and estimated servicing cash\nflows of commercial and residential mortgage\nloan commitments. Probability of default and\nloss severity are the significant unobservable\ninputs used in the valuation of risk\nparticipation agreements.

These swaps also require PNC to\nmake periodic payments based on the market\nprice of the Class A common shares at a fixed\nrate of interest (in certain cases subject to\nstep-up provisions) until the Visa litigation\nis resolved. An increase in the estimated\nlength of litigation resolution date, a\ndecrease in the estimated conversion rate, or\nan increase in the estimated growth rate of\nthe Class A share price would have had a\nnegative impact on the fair value of the swaps\nand vice versa.\n\nThe fair values of our derivatives include a\ncredit valuation adjustment to reflect our own\nand our counterparties\u2019 nonperformance risk.\nOur credit valuation adjustment is computed\nusing credit default swap spreads, in\nconjunction with internal historical recovery\nobservations.\n\nOther Assets and Liabilities\n\nOther assets held at fair value on a recurring\nbasis primarily include assets related to\nPNC\u2019s deferred compensation and supplemental\nincentive savings plans.\n\nThe assets related to PNC\u2019s deferred\ncompensation and supplemental incentive\nsavings plans primarily consist of a prepaid\nforward contract referencing an amount of\nshares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and\nfixed income funds, and are valued based on\nthe underlying investments. These assets are\nvalued either by reference to the market price\nof PNC\u2019s stock or by using the quoted market\nprices for investments other than PNC\u2019s stock\nand are classified in Levels 1 and 2.\n\nAll Level 3 other assets and liabilities are\nincluded in the Insignificant Level 3 assets,\nnet of liabilities line item in Table 87 in\nthis Note 15.\n\nOther Borrowed Funds\n\nOther borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S.\nTreasury securities sold short which are\nclassified as Level 1.

These adjustments to fair\nvalue usually result from the application of\nlower of amortized cost or fair value\naccounting or write-downs of individual assets\ndue to impairment and are included in Table\n88.\n\nNonaccrual Loans\n\nThe carrying value of nonaccrual loans\nrepresents the fair value of those loans which\nhave been adjusted due to impairment. The\nimpairment is primarily based on the appraised\nvalue of the collateral.\n\nAppraisals are obtained by licensed or\ncertified appraisers at least annually and\nmore recently in certain instances. All third-\nparty appraisals are reviewed and any\nadjustments to the initial appraisal are\nincorporated into the final issued appraisal\nreport. In instances where an appraisal is not\nobtained, collateral value is determined\nconsistent with external third-party appraisal\nstandards by an internal person independent of\nthe asset manager.\n\nOREO and Foreclosed Assets\n\nThe carrying value of OREO and foreclosed\nassets includes valuation adjustments recorded\nsubsequent to the transfer to OREO and\nforeclosed assets. These valuation adjustments\nare based on the fair value less cost to sell\nof the property. Fair value is based on\nappraised value or sales price and the\nappraisal process for OREO and foreclosed\nassets is the same as described above for\nnonaccrual loans.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 153\nLong-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets consists of buildings for\nwhich valuation adjustments were recorded\nduring the period. A facility classified as\nheld for use is impaired to the extent its\ncarrying value is not recoverable and exceeds\nfair value. Valuation adjustments on buildings\nheld for sale are based on the fair value of\nthe property less an estimated cost to sell\nand are recorded subsequent to the transfer of\nthe asset to held for sale status. Fair value\nis determined either by a third-party\nappraisal, recent sales offer, changes in\nmarket or property conditions, or, where we\nhave agreed to sell the building to a third\nparty, the contractual sales price. Impairment\non these long-lived assets is recorded in\nOther noninterest expense on our Consolidated\nIncome Statement.\n\nAssets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis follow:\n\nTable 88: Fair Value Measurements \u2013\nNonrecurring (a) (b) (c)\n                                              \n                 \u2026                            \n                 \u2026           \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                      $           \u2026      $    \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                      $           \u2026      $    \n                                              \n(a) All Level 3 for the periods presented.\n\n(b) Valuation techniques applied were fair\nvalue of property or collateral.\n\n(c) Unobservable inputs used were appraised\nvalue/sales price, broker opinions or\nprojected income/required improvement costs.\nAdditional quantitative information was not\nmeaningful for the periods presented.\n\nFinancial Instruments Accounted for under Fair\nValue Option\n\nWe elect the fair value option to account for\ncertain financial instruments.

These financial\ninstruments are initially measured at fair\nvalue.

We used the following methods\nand assumptions to estimate the fair value\namounts for these financial instruments.\n\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning\nDeposits with Banks\n\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying\namounts for Cash and due from banks and\nInterest-earning deposits with banks reported\non our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate\nfair value.\n\nSecurities Held to Maturity\n\nWe primarily use prices obtained from pricing\nservices, dealer quotes or recent trades to\ndetermine the fair value of securities. Refer\nto the Fair Value Measurement section of this\nNote 15 for additional information relating to\nour pricing processes and procedures.\n\nNet Loans\n\nFair values are estimated based on the\ndiscounted value of expected net cash flows\nincorporating assumptions about prepayment\nrates, net credit losses and servicing fees.\nNonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated\nrecovery value. Loans are presented net of the\nALLL.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 155\nOther Assets\n\nThe carrying value of Other assets, which\ninclude accrued interest receivable, cash\ncollateral, federal funds sold and resale\nagreements, certain loans held for sale, and\nFHLB and FRB stock, approximates fair value.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and\nFRB stock was $ 1.3billion and $ 1.1billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nDeposits\n\nFor time deposits, fair values are estimated\nby discounting contractual cash flows using\ncurrent market rates for instruments with\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing\nand interest-bearing demand and interest-\nbearing money market and savings deposits,\ncarrying values approximate fair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nFor short-term borrowed funds, including\nfederal funds purchased, commercial paper,\nrepurchase agreements and certain other short-\nterm borrowings and payables, carrying value\napproximates fair value. For long-term\nborrowed funds, quoted market prices are used,\nwhen available, to estimate fair value.

Any\nnonperformance risk, including credit risk, is\nincluded in the determination of the estimated\nnet fair value of the derivatives. Further\ndiscussion on how derivatives are accounted\nfor is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk as part of our\nasset and liability risk management activities\nare designated as accounting hedges.\nDerivatives hedging the risks associated with\nchanges in the fair value of assets or\nliabilities are considered fair value hedges,\nderivatives hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are considered cash\nflow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net\ninvestment in a foreign subsidiary are\nconsidered net investment hedges. Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow December 31,\n2021, we expect to reclassify net derivative\ngains of $ 187million pretax, or $ 144million\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to December 31,\n2021. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is ten years.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n

exchange rates. We\nassess whether the hedging relationship is\nhighly effective in achieving offsetting\nchanges in the value of the hedge and hedged\nitem by qualitatively verifying that the\ncritical terms of the hedge and hedged item\nmatch at the inception of the hedging\nrelationship and on an ongoing basis. Net\ninvestment hedge derivatives are classified as\nforeign exchange contracts.

Changes in\nthe fair value of the loans and commitments\ndue to interest rate risk are hedged with\nforward contracts to sell mortgage-backed\nsecurities, as well as U.S. Treasury and\nEurodollar futures and options. Gains and\nlosses on the loans and commitments held for\nsale and the derivatives used to economically\nhedge them are included in Residential\nmortgage noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Income Statement.\n\nResidential mortgage servicing rights are\naccounted for at fair value with changes in\nfair value influenced primarily by changes in\ninterest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the\nfair value of residential mortgage servicing\nrights include interest rate futures, swaps,\noptions, and forward contracts to purchase\nmortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses\non residential mortgage servicing rights and\nthe related derivatives used for hedging are\nincluded in Residential mortgage noninterest\nincome.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nthe related loan commitments, which are\nconsidered derivatives, are accounted for at\nfair value. Derivatives used to economically\nhedge these loans and commitments from changes\nin fair value due to interest rate risk\ninclude forward loan sale contracts and\ninterest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the\ncommitments, loans and derivatives are\nincluded in Other noninterest income.\nDerivatives used to economically hedge the\nchange in value of commercial mortgage\nservicing rights include interest rate\nfutures, swaps and options. Gains or losses on\nthese derivatives are included in Corporate\nservices noninterest income.\n\nThe residential and commercial mortgage loan\ncommitments associated with loans to be sold\nwhich are accounted for as derivatives are\nvalued based on the estimated fair value of\nthe underlying loan and the probability that\nthe loan will fund within the terms of the\ncommitment. The fair value also takes into\naccount the fair value of the embedded\nservicing right.\n\nWe offer derivatives to our customers in\nconnection with their risk management needs.\nThese derivatives primarily consist of\ninterest rate swaps, interest rate caps and\nfloors, swaptions and foreign exchange\ncontracts. We primarily manage our market risk\nexposure from customer transactions by\nentering into a variety of hedging\ntransactions with third-party dealers. Gains\nand losses on customer-related derivatives are\nincluded in Other noninterest income.\n\nIncluded in the customer, mortgage banking\nrisk management, and other risk management\nportfolios are written interest-rate caps and\nfloors entered into with customers and for\nrisk management purposes. We receive an\nupfront premium from the counterparty and are\nobligated to make payments to the counterparty\nif the underlying market interest rate rises\nabove or falls below a certain level\ndesignated in the contract. Our ultimate\nobligation under written options is based on\nfuture market conditions.\n\nWe have entered into risk participation\nagreements to share some of the credit\nexposure with other counterparties related to\ninterest rate derivative contracts or to take\non credit exposure to generate revenue.

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nCollateral is typically exchanged daily on\nunsettled positions based on the net fair\nvalue of the positions with the counterparty\nas of the preceding day. Collateral\nrepresenting initial margin, which is based on\npotential future exposure, may also be\nrequired to be exchanged. In certain cases,\nminimum thresholds must be exceeded before any\ncollateral is exchanged. Any cash collateral\nexchanged with counterparties under these\nmaster netting agreements is also netted, when\nappropriate, against the applicable derivative\nfair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nHowever, the fair value of any securities held\nor pledged is not included in the net\npresentation on the balance sheet. In order\nfor derivative instruments under a master\nnetting agreement to be eligible for closeout\nnetting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient\nlegal review to conclude with a well-founded\nbasis that the offsetting rights included in\nthe master netting agreement would be legally\nenforceable upon an event of default,\nincluding upon an event of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, or a similar proceeding of the\ncounterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a\nlegal opinion that supports, with sufficient\nconfidence, the enforceability of the master\nnetting agreement in such circumstances.\n\nTable 97 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The table\nincludes cash collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nThe table also includes the fair value of any\nsecurities collateral held or pledged under\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nCash and securities collateral amounts are\nincluded in the table only to the extent of\nthe related net derivative fair values.\n\nTable 97 includes OTC derivatives and OTC\nderivatives cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. OTC derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties that\nare not settled through an organized exchange\nor directly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house who then becomes our\ncounterparty. OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\n\n162 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\nTable 97: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, cash and debt securities\n(primarily agency mortgage-backed securities)\ntotaling $ 1.4billion were pledged to us under\nmaster netting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements, and we pledged\ncash and debt securities (primarily agency\nmortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n2.5billion under these agreements to\ncollateralize net derivative liabilities owed\nto counterparties and to meet initial margin\nrequirements. These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged exceeds the net derivative fair values\nwith the counterparty as of the balance sheet\ndate due to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk-related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions.

Benefits are determined using a\ncash balance formula where earnings credits\nare a percentage of eligible compensation.\nEarnings credit percentages for those\nemployees who were plan participants on\nDecember 31, 2009 are frozen at the level\nearned to that point. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who became participants on or after\nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible\ncompensation. All participants as of December\n31, 2009 earn a minimum rate on their cash\nbalances; new participants on or after January\n1, 2010 earn interest credits on their cash\nbalances based on 30-year Treasury securities.\nNew participants on or after January 1, 2010\nare not subject to the minimum rate. The plan\nprovides for a minimum annual earnings credit\namount of $ 2,000, subject to eligibility\ncriteria. Pension contributions to the plan\nare typically based on an actuarially\ndetermined amount necessary to fund total\nbenefits payable to plan participants. Assets\nof the qualified pension plan are held in a\nseparate Trust.\n\nWe also maintain nonqualified supplemental\nretirement plans for certain employees and\nprovide certain health care and life insurance\nbenefits for qualifying retired employees\n(postretirement benefits) through various\nplans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or\nmake changes to these plans at any time. The\nnonqualified pension plan is unfunded.\nContributions from PNC and, in the case of the\npostretirement benefit plans, participant\ncontributions cover all benefits paid under\nthe nonqualified pension plan and\npostretirement benefit plans. The\npostretirement plan provides benefits to\ncertain retirees that are at least actuarially\nequivalent to those provided by Medicare Part\nD and accordingly, we receive a federal\nsubsidy. PNC has established a VEBA to\npartially fund postretirement medical and life\ninsurance benefit obligations.\n\nWe use a measurement date of December 31 for\nplan assets and benefit obligations.

Certain domestic equity\ninvestment managers utilize derivatives and\nfixed income securities as described in their\nInvestment Management Agreements to achieve\ntheir investment objective under the\nInvestment Policy Statement. Other investment\nmanagers may invest in eligible securities\noutside of their assigned asset category to\nmeet their investment objectives. The actual\npercentage of the fair value of total Plan\nassets held as of December 31, 2021 for equity\nsecurities, fixed income securities, real\nestate and all other assets are 57%, 25%, 5%\nand 13%, respectively.\n\nWe believe that, over the long term, asset\nallocation is the single greatest determinant\nof risk. Asset allocation will deviate from\nthe target percentages due to market movement,\ncash flows, investment manager performance and\nimplementation of shifts under the dynamic\nasset allocation policy. Material deviations\nfrom the asset allocation targets can alter\nthe expected return and risk of the Trust.\nHowever, frequent rebalancing of the asset\nallocation targets may result in significant\ntransaction costs, which can impair the\nTrust\u2019s ability to meet its investment\nobjective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is\nperiodically rebalanced to maintain asset\nallocation within the target ranges described\nabove.\n\nIn addition to being diversified across asset\nclasses, the Trust is diversified within each\nasset class. Secondary diversification\nprovides a reasonable basis for the\nexpectation that no single security or class\nof securities will have a disproportionate\nimpact on the total risk and return of the\nTrust.\n\nWhere investment strategies permit the use of\nderivatives and/or currency management,\nlanguage is incorporated in the managers\u2019\nguidelines to define allowable and prohibited\ntransactions and/or strategies. Derivatives\nare typically employed by investment managers\nto modify risk/return characteristics of their\nportfolio(s), implement asset allocation\nchanges in a cost effective manner, or reduce\ntransaction costs. Under the managers\u2019\ninvestment guidelines, derivatives may not be\nused solely for speculation or leverage.\nDerivatives are to be used only in\ncircumstances where they offer the most\nefficient economic means of improving the\nrisk/reward profile of the portfolio.\n\n166 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nAs further described in Note 15 Fair Value,\nGAAP establishes the framework for measuring\nfair value, including a hierarchy used to\nclassify the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue.\nA description of the valuation methodologies\nused for assets measured at fair value at both\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 follows:\nTable 101: Pension Plan Valuation\nMethodologies\n                                              \n                         Valuation            \n                         Methodology          \n                         \u2022 Valued at the NAV  \n                         of the shares held   \n  Asset                  by the pension plan  \n  Money market funds     at year end.         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                         \u2022 Valued at the      \n                         closing price        \n                         reported on the      \n                         active market on     \n                         which the            \n                         individual           \n                         securities are       \n                         traded.              \n                         \u2022 If quoted market   \n                         prices are not       \n                         available for the    \n                         specific security,   \n                         then fair values     \n  U.S. government and    are estimated by     \n  agency securities      using pricing        \n  Corporate debt         models or quoted     \n  Common stock           prices of            \n                         securities with      \n                         similar              \n                         characteristics.     \n                         Such securities are  \n                         generally            \n                         classified within    \n                         Level 2 of the       \n                         valuation hierarchy  \n                         but may be a Level   \n                         3 depending on the   \n                         level of liquidity   \n                         and activity in the  \n                         market for the       \n                         security.            \n                         \u2022 Valued based on    \n                         third-party pricing  \n  Mutual funds           of the fund which    \n                         is not actively      \n                         traded.              \n                         \u2022 Derivative         \n                         financial            \n                         instruments -

   \n(a) Rate disclosed is for the qualified\npension plan.\n(b) Rate is applicable only to the\npostretirement benefit plans.\nThe discount rates are determined\nindependently for each plan by comparing the\nexpected future benefits that will be paid\nunder each plan with yields available on high\nquality corporate bonds of similar duration.\nFor this analysis, 10% of bonds with the\nhighest yields and 40% with the lowest yields\nwere removed from the bond universe.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-\nterm assumption established by considering\nhistorical and anticipated returns of the\nasset classes invested in by the pension plan\nand the allocation strategy currently in place\namong those classes. For purposes of setting\nand reviewing this assumption, \u201clong-term\u201d\nrefers to the period over which the plan\u2019s\nprojected benefit obligations will be\ndisbursed. We review this assumption at each\nmeasurement date and adjust it if warranted.\nOur selection process references certain\nhistorical data and the current environment,\nbut primarily utilizes qualitative judgment\nregarding future return expectations. We also\nexamine the assumption used by other companies\nwith similar pension investment strategies.\nTaking into account all of these factors, as\nwell as the BBVA plan assets acquired during\nthe year, the expected long-term return on\nmerged plan assets for determining net\nperiodic pension cost for 2021 was 4.40%. We\nare increasing our expected long-term return\non assets to 4.50% for determining pension\ncost for 2022. This decision was made after\nconsidering the views of both internal and\nexternal capital market advisors, particularly\nwith regard to the effects of the recent\neconomic environment on long-term prospective\nequity and fixed income returns.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 169\nWith all other assumptions held constant, a\n0.50% decline in the discount rate would have\nresulted in an immaterial change in net\nperiodic benefit cost in 2021 and to be\nrecognized in 2022 for each of the qualified\npension, nonqualified pension and\npostretirement benefit plans.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nThe ISP is a qualified defined contribution\nplan that covers all of our eligible\nemployees. Newly-hired full time employees and\npart-time employees who are eligible to\nparticipate in the ISP are automatically\nenrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal\nto 4% of eligible compensation in the absence\nof an affirmative election otherwise. Employee\nbenefits expense related to the ISP was $\n168million in 2021, $ 147million in 2020 and $\n139million in 2019, representing cash\ncontributed to the ISP by PNC.\n\nThe ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an\nemployee stock ownership feature. Employee\ncontributions are invested in a number of\ninvestment options, including pre-mixed\nportfolios and individual core funds,\navailable under the ISP at the direction of\nthe employee.\n\nBBVA maintained a defined contribution plan,\nthe BBVA USA SmartInvestor 401(k) plan. This\nplan was terminated on October 9, 2021, and\nthe assets were transferred into the PNC ISP.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  18 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  TOCK B ASED C OMPENSATION P LANS            \n                                              \nWe have long-term incentive award plans\n(Incentive Plans) that provide for the\ngranting of incentive stock options,\nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, incentive shares/performance units,\nrestricted share units, other share-based\nawards and dollar-denominated awards to\nexecutives and, other than incentive stock\noptions, to non-employee directors. Certain\nIncentive Plan awards may be paid in stock,\ncash or a combination of stock and cash.

The value of certain\nperformance share unit awards is subsequently\nremeasured based on the achievement of one or\nmore performance goals. Additionally, certain\nperformance share unit awards could require\nsubsequent adjustment due to certain\ndiscretionary risk review triggers.\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of\nperformance share unit awards and restricted\nshare unit awards granted in 2021, 2020 and\n2019 was $ 161.04, $ 150.23and $ 117.53per\nshare, respectively. The total intrinsic value\nof performance share unit awards and\nrestricted share unit awards vested during\n2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $\n207million, $ 213million and $ 218million,\nrespectively.

One or more of the\nfollowing factors frequently contribute to\nthis inherent unpredictability: the proceeding\nis in its early stages; the damages sought are\nunspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is\nunclear whether a case brought as a class\naction will be allowed to proceed on that\nbasis or, if permitted to proceed as a class\naction, how the class will be defined; the\nother party is seeking relief other than or in\naddition to compensatory damages (including,\nin the case of regulatory and governmental\ninvestigations and inquiries, the possibility\nof fines and penalties); the matter presents\nmeaningful legal uncertainties, including\nnovel issues of law; we have not engaged in\nmeaningful settlement discussions; discovery\nhas not started or is not complete; there are\nsignificant facts in dispute; the possible\noutcomes may not be amenable to the use of\nstatistical or quantitative analytical tools;\npredicting possible outcomes depends on making\nassumptions about future decisions of courts\nor regulatory bodies or the behavior of other\nparties; and there are a large number of\nparties named as defendants (including where\nit is uncertain how damages or liability, if\nany, will be shared among multiple\ndefendants). Generally, the less progress that\nhas been made in the proceedings or the\nbroader the range of potential results, the\nharder it is for us to estimate losses or\nranges of losses that it is reasonably\npossible we could incur.\n\nAs a result of these types of factors, we are\nunable, at this time, to estimate the losses\nthat are reasonably possible to be incurred or\nranges of such losses with respect to some of\nthe matters disclosed, and the aggregate\nestimated amount provided above does not\ninclude an estimate for every Disclosed\nMatter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate\namount disclosed above does not include all of\nthe Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed\nabove does not represent our maximum\nreasonably possible loss exposure for all of\nthe\n\n174 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nInterchange Litigation\n\nBeginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust\nlawsuits were filed against Visa \u00ae ,\nMastercard \u00ae , and several major financial\ninstitutions, including cases naming National\nCity (since merged into The PNC Financial\nServices Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary,\nNational City Bank of Kentucky (since merged\ninto National City Bank which in turn was\nmerged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these\ncases are merchants operating commercial\nbusinesses throughout the U.S., as well as\ntrade associations. Some of these cases\n(including those naming National City\nentities) were brought as class actions on\nbehalf of all persons or business entities\nthat have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The\ncases have been consolidated for pre-trial\nproceedings in the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of New York under the caption\nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and\nMerchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master\nFile No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JO).\n\nIn July 2012, the parties entered into a\nmemorandum of understanding with the class\nplaintiffs and an agreement in principle with\ncertain individual plaintiffs with respect to\na settlement of these cases, under which the\ndefendants agreed to pay approximately $\n6.6billion collectively to the class and\nindividual settling plaintiffs and agreed to\nchanges in the terms applicable to their\nrespective card networks (including an eight-\nmonth reduction in default credit interchange\nrates). The parties entered into a definitive\nagreement with respect to this settlement in\nOctober 2012. The court granted final approval\nof the settlement in December 2013. Several\nobjectors appealed the order of approval to\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit, which issued an order in June 2016,\nreversing approval of the settlement and\nremanding for further proceedings. In November\n2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court\nto challenge the court of appeal\u2019s decision.\nThe Supreme Court denied the petition in March\n2017.\n\nAs a result of the reversal of the approval of\nthe settlement, the class actions have resumed\nin the district court. In November 2016, the\ndistrict court appointed separate interim\nclass counsel for a proposed class seeking\ndamages and a proposed class seeking equitable\n(injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of\nthese counsel filed a proposed amended and\nsupplemental complaint on behalf of its\nrespective proposed class. These complaints\nmake similar allegations, including that the\ndefendants conspired to monopolize and to fix\nthe prices for general purpose card network\nservices, that the restructuring of Visa and\nMastercard, each of which included an initial\npublic offering, violated the antitrust laws,\nand that the defendants otherwise imposed\nunreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in\nthe payment of inflated interchange fees and\nother fees, which also violated the antitrust\nlaws. In their complaints, collectively the\nplaintiffs seek, among other things,\ninjunctive relief, unspecified damages\n(trebled under the antitrust laws) and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. PNC is named as a defendant\nin the complaint seeking damages but is not\nnamed as a defendant in the complaint that\nseeks equitable relief.\n\nIn September 2017, the magistrate judge at the\ndistrict court granted in part and denied in\npart the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to file their\nproposed amended complaints. The dispute over\namendment arose in part from the decision in\nUnited States v. American Express, Co., 838\nF.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), in which the court\nheld that the relevant market in a similar\ncomplaint against American Express is \u201ctwo-\nsided,\u201d i.e ., requires consideration of\neffects on consumers as well as merchants. In\nJune 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed\n(under the caption Ohio v. American Express\nCo. ) the court of appeals decision .\nPreviously, the plaintiffs in this litigation\nhad alleged a one-sided market, and, as a\nresult of the court\u2019s decision in American\nExpress , they sought leave to add claims\nbased on a two-sided market. The order allowed\nthe complaint to be amended to include\nallegations pertaining to a two-sided market\nonly to the extent those claims are not time-\nbarred, but held that the two-sided market\nallegations do not relate back to the time of\nthe original complaint and are not subject to\ntolling. In October 2017, the plaintiffs\nappealed this order to the presiding district\ncourt judge. In August 2018, the judge\noverruled this decision, finding that the two-\nsided market allegations do relate back.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 175\nIn September 2018, the relevant parties\nentered an amended definitive agreement to\nresolve the claims of the class seeking\ndamages. In this amended settlement agreement,\nthe parties agreed, among other things, to the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\u2022 An additional settlement payment from all\ndefendants of $ 900million, with Visa\u2019s share\nof the additional settlement payment being $\n600million. The additional settlement payment\nwill be added to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously paid by the defendants\npursuant to the original 2012 settlement\nagreement.\n\n\u2022 Up to $ 700million may be returned to the\ndefendants (with up to $ 467million to Visa)\nif more than 15% of class members (by payment\nvolume) opt out of the class. As more than 15%\nof class members opted out of the class, $\n700million has been returned to the defendants\n($ 467million to Visa).\n\nThis amended settlement agreement is subject\nto court approval. Following preliminary\napproval in January 2019, and after class\nnotice, the submission of opt-outs, and the\nfiling of objections, the district court\ngranted final approval of the settlement in\nDecember 2019. Several objectors have appealed\nthe district court\u2019s order granting final\napproval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. Oral argument of this appeal\nis presently scheduled for March 16, 2022.\nSome merchants that opted out from the\nsettlement have brought lawsuits against Visa\nand Mastercard and one or more of the issuing\nbanks. Resolution by Visa of claims by\nmerchants that opted out of the settlement,\nincluding those that file lawsuits, have been\nor will be paid from the Visa litigation\nescrow account.\n\nNational City and National City Bank entered\ninto judgment and loss sharing agreements with\nVisa and certain other banks with respect to\nall of the above referenced litigation. We\nwere not originally named as defendants in any\nof the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust\nlitigation nor were we initially parties to\nthe judgment or loss sharing agreements.\nHowever, we became responsible for National\nCity\u2019s and National City Bank\u2019s position in\nthe litigation and responsibilities under the\nagreements through our acquisition of National\nCity. In addition, following Visa\u2019s\nreorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its\ninitial public offering, U.S. Visa members\nreceived shares of Class B Visa common stock,\nconvertible upon resolution of specified\nlitigation, including the remaining litigation\ndescribed above, into shares of Class A Visa\ncommon stock, with the conversion rate\nadjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed\nto resolve the specified litigation, and also\nremained responsible for indemnifying Visa\nagainst the specified litigation. Our Class B\nVisa common stock is all subject to this\nconversion adjustment provision, and we are\nnow responsible for the indemnification\nobligations of our predecessors as well as\nourselves. We have also entered into a\nMastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing\nAgreement with Mastercard and other financial\ninstitution defendants and an Omnibus\nAgreement Regarding Interchange Litigation\nSharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa,\nMastercard and other financial institution\ndefendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in\nsubstance, apportions resolution of the claims\nin this litigation into a Visa portion and a\nMastercard portion, with the Visa portion\nbeing two-thirds and the Mastercard portion\nbeing one-third. This apportionment only\napplies in the case of either a global\nsettlement involving all defendants or an\nadverse judgment against the defendants, to\nthe extent that damages either are related to\nthe merchants\u2019 inter-network conspiracy claims\nor are otherwise not attributed to specific\nMastercard or Visa conduct or damages. The\nMastercard portion (or any Mastercard-related\nliability not subject to the Omnibus\nAgreement) will then be apportioned under the\nMastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing\nAgreement among Mastercard and PNC and the\nother financial institution defendants that\nare parties to this agreement. The\nresponsibility for the Visa portion (or any\nVisa-related liability not subject to the\nOmnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under\nthe pre-existing indemnification\nresponsibilities and judgment and loss sharing\nagreements.\n\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn September 2020, a lawsuit ( United Services\nAutomobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. (Case\nNo. 2:20-cv-319)) was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District\nof Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (\"the first Texas case\"). The\nplaintiff amended its complaint in December\n2020. As amended, the complaint alleges that\nPNC\u2019s mobile remote deposit capture systems\ninfringe on four patents owned by the\nplaintiff. The plaintiff seeks, among other\nthings, a judgment that PNC is infringing each\nof the patents, damages for willful\ninfringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In December\n2020, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint, and in January 2021, we filed a\nmotion to transfer the lawsuit to the United\nStates District Court for the Western District\nof Pennsylvania. In February 2021, we answered\nthe amended complaint and asserted\ncounterclaims alleging that the plaintiff\ninfringed four patents owned by PNC Bank, as\nwell as for a declaratory judgment that PNC\nBank does not infringe certain patents\nasserted by the plaintiff. In March 2021, the\nplaintiff filed a motion to dismiss two of the\npatent infringement counterclaims, as well as\nto sever the patent infringement counterclaims\nfor trial. In June 2021, the plaintiff filed\nan answer to PNC\u2019s counterclaims and asserted\na counterclaim in reply seeking a declaratory\njudgment that two of the asserted PNC patents\nare unenforceable due to inequitable conduct\nand unclean hands in prosecution of the\npatents. In September 2021, the court denied\nour motion to dismiss and our motion to\ntransfer the case. In November 2021, the court\ndenied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss two\nof the patent infringement counterclaims. Also\nin November 2021, the court issued a\nmemorandum opinion and order construing\ncertain claim terms of the patents in suit.\n\nIn December 2020, we filed a lawsuit ( PNC\nBank, N.A. v. United Services Automobile\nAssociation (Case No. 2:20-cv-1886)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania against USAA seeking\ndeclaratory judgment of non-infringement as to\ntwo of the patents at issue in the first Texas\ncase and awarding PNC its fees and costs. In\nJanuary 2021, USAA filed a motion to dismiss\nor transfer PNC Bank\u2019s declaratory judgment\ncomplaint. In June 2021, the court stayed this\ncase pending a decision on the motion to\ntransfer filed by PNC Bank in the first Texas\ncase. The United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Texas denied PNC Bank\u2019s\nmotion to transfer in the first Texas case in\nSeptember 2021. This case presently remains\nstayed.\n\n176 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\n2021 Form 10-K\n\nIn March 2021, USAA filed a second lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-110)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement. The complaint alleges that PNC\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit capture systems infringe\ntwo patents owned by the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff seeks, among other things, a\njudgment that PNC is infringing each of the\npatents, damages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. In April 2021, we moved to\nconsolidate this action with the first Texas\ncase and we filed motions to dismiss and\ntransfer this action. In July 2021, this\naction was consolidated with the first Texas\ncase (together, \"the consolidated cases\"). In\nSeptember 2021, the court denied our motion to\ndismiss and our motion to transfer for the\nsame reasons set forth in its September 2021\norders in the first Texas case. In November\n2021, the court issued a memorandum opinion\nand order construing certain claim terms of\nthe patents in suit. Trial in the consolidated\ncases is presently scheduled to commence on\nApril 18, 2022.\n\nIn July 2021, USAA filed a third lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PN C\nBank N.A . (Case No. 2:21-cv-246)) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas against PNC Bank for patent\ninfringement (\"the third Texas case\"). The\ncomplaint alleges that PNC\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems, including its new\nversions, infringe three additional patents\nowned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks,\namong other things, a judgment that PNC is\ninfringing each of the patents, damages for\nwillful infringement, and attorneys\u2019 fees. In\nJuly 2021, we filed motions to dismiss and\ntransfer this action; the court denied these\nmotions in January 2022. Trial in this case is\npresently scheduled to commence on August 22,\n2022.\n\nIn August 2021, USAA filed a lawsuit ( United\nServices Automobile Association v. BBVA USA\n(Case No. 2:21-cv-311)) in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of\nTexas against BBVA USA for patent infringement\n(\"the BBVA USA Texas case\"). The complaint\nalleges that BBVA USA\u2019s remote deposit capture\nsystems infringe the same six USAA patents at\nissue in the consolidated cases. The plaintiff\nseeks, among other things, a judgment that\nBBVA USA is infringing each of the patents,\ndamages for willful infringement, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. In October 2021, BBVA USA was\nmerged into PNC Bank. Also in October 2021, we\nanswered the complaint and asserted\ncounterclaims for a declaratory judgment that\nthe asserted patents are invalid and not\ninfringed. Trial in this case is presently\nscheduled to commence on October 31, 2022.\n\nIn January 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard granted institution of inter partes\nreview (\"IPR\") with respect to petitions filed\nby PNC for three of the six patents at issue\nin the consolidated cases and in the BBVA USA\nTexas case. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board\ndenied institution of an IPR with respect to\nPNC\u2019s petitions for one of the six patents at\nissue in the consolidated cases and in the\nBBVA USA Texas case. PNC\u2019s petitions for IPR\nwith respect to the other two patents in the\nconsolidated cases and the BBVA USA Texas case\nand with respect to the three patents in the\nthird Texas case remain pending. The IPR\nproceedings at the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard, presently scheduled to commence on\nOctober 25 and 26, 2022, will review the\npatentability of the claims in the patents for\nwhich IPR is granted.\n\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\n\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits,\nexaminations and other forms of regulatory and\ngovernmental inquiry covering a broad range of\nissues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage,\nsecurities and other financial services\nbusinesses, as well as other aspects of our\noperations. In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of reviews of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries have involved\nand may in the future involve or lead to\nregulatory enforcement actions and other\nadministrative proceedings. These inquiries\nhave also led to and may in the future lead to\ncivil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some\nof these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint, but could\nbe in the future. Even if not financially\nmaterial, they may result in significant\nreputational harm or other adverse\nconsequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries, including that\ndescribed in this Note 21.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described above, PNC and persons to\nwhom we may have indemnification obligations,\nin the normal course of business, are subject\nto various other pending and threatened legal\nproceedings in which claims for monetary\ndamages and other relief are asserted. We do\nnot anticipate, at the present time, that the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of such other legal proceedings will have\na material adverse effect on our financial\nposition. However, we cannot now determine\nwhether or not any claims asserted against us\nor others to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, whether in the proceedings or\nother matters described above or otherwise,\nwill have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations in any future reporting\nperiod, which will depend on, among other\nthings, the amount of the loss resulting from\nthe claim and the amount of income otherwise\nreported for the reporting period.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 2021\n                                 Form 10-K 177\n

Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices. There is no comprehensive,\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the\nfinancial results of our individual businesses\nare not necessarily comparable with similar\ninformation for any other company. We\nperiodically refine our internal methodologies\nas management reporting practices are\nenhanced. To the extent significant and\npracticable, retrospective application of new\nmethodologies is made to prior period\nreportable business segment results and\ndisclosures to create comparability with the\ncurrent period.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock,\nwhich had previously been reported as a\nseparate business segment. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity for\nadditional information on the sale and details\non our results and cash flow for 2020 and\n2019.\n\nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income.\nThese differences are reflected in the \u201cOther\u201d\ncategory in Table 119. \u201cOther\u201d includes\nresidual activities that do not meet the\ncriteria for disclosure as a separate\nreportable business, such as asset and\nliability management activities including net\nsecurities gains or losses, ACL for investment\nsecurities, certain trading activities,\ncertain runoff consumer loan portfolios,\nprivate equity investments, intercompany\neliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax\nadjustments that are not allocated to business\nsegments, exited businesses and differences\nbetween business segment performance reporting\nand financial statement reporting (GAAP). The\n\u201cOther\u201d category also includes our BlackRock\nheld for sale asset in 2019. Assets, revenue\nand earnings attributable to foreign\nactivities were not material in the periods\npresented for comparison.\n\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent\npracticable, as if each business operated on a\nstand-alone basis. Additionally, we have\naggregated the results for corporate support\nfunctions within \u201cOther\u201d for financial\nreporting purposes.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology.

maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as such term is defined in the\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\n\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nWe performed an evaluation under the\nsupervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including the Chairman, President\nand Chief Executive Officer and the Executive\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer, of\nthe effectiveness of PNC\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31,\n2021. This assessment was based on criteria\nfor effective internal control over financial\nreporting described in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. Based on this assessment,\nmanagement concluded that PNC maintained\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm that audited\nour consolidated financial statements as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2021\nincluded in this Report, has also audited
