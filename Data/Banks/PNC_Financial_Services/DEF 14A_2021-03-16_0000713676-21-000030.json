We\nfaced a once-in-a-century pandemic, severe\neconomic fallout and a level of social unrest\nnot seen since the 1960s.\n\nAs PNC\u2019s lead independent director, and on\nbehalf of the whole board, I want to thank you\nfor your support and share a few of PNC\u2019s\nachievements during an extraordinary year.\nLike they have done so many times in the past,\nPNC\u2019s leadership and 51,000 employees stepped\nup. Among their outstanding accomplishments:\n\n\u2022 PNC transitioned more than 30,000 employees\nto a remote work environment and established\ncomprehensive safety protocols for branch and\nother onsite employees so that they could\ncontinue to serve customers. In addition, the\ncompany expanded its mental health and\nchildcare resources, among other benefits and\nprograms, to better support employees\nthroughout the pandemic .\n\n\u2022 Thousands of employees worked around the\nclock to grant nearly $15 billion in loan\nmodifications and fund small businesses with\napproximately $13 billion in badly needed\nPaycheck Protection Program loans.\n\n\u2022 PNC injected $30 million into communities\ndisproportionately impacted by the pandemic\nwhile continuing to invest in early childhood\neducation through PNC Grow Up Great, a more\nthan $500 million philanthropic program that\nsupports children from low- and moderate-\nincome families from birth to age 5.\n\n\u2022 PNC announced a $1 billion commitment to\nhelp fight systemic racism and support the\neconomic empowerment of Black Americans and\nlow- and moderate-income communities. This\ncommitment, overseen by our board\u2019s new\nSpecial Committee on Equity & Inclusion, will\ncome to life with a focus on education,\nentrepreneurship and economic empowerment. In\naddition, the company is taking concrete steps\nto continue creating a more diverse and\ninclusive culture for all employees. This\nincludes better attracting, developing and\nadvancing diverse talent.\n\n\u2022 The company undertook two significant\ntransactions critical to its long-term\nstrategy, selling its equity stake in\nBlackRock for $14.2 billion and announcing an\nagreement to acquire BBVA USA for $11.6\nbillion.\n\nIn short, because of PNC\u2019s strong core values,\nongoing investments in technology and talent,\nand relentless execution of its strategic\npriorities, the board believes the company\nmade the most of an incredibly difficult year.\n\nThe PNC board stepped up last year, too,\nworking harder than ever to fulfill our\nfiduciary duty, holding more than 65 board and\ncommittee meetings, creating a new Special\nCommittee on Equity & Inclusion, engaging\nregularly on PNC's pandemic response,\noverseeing the sale of BlackRock and agreement\nto acquire BBVA USA, and maintaining a regular\nand constructive dialogue with regulators.\n                                              \n  Leadership Diversity and Talent-Focused     \n  Culture                                     \n                                              \nThe board and I have never been more confident\nin PNC\u2019s leadership and optimistic about what\nthe company can achieve over the coming years.\nWe have the most diverse board and Executive\nCommittee in PNC\u2019s history, with 33% of our\nindependent directors being women, 25% being\nracially diverse, and the majority of the\nExecutive Committee, which reports to CEO Bill\nDemchak, being gender and racially diverse.\nRecognizing the importance of this diversity,\nas well as the importance of diversity across\nthe organization, PNC plans to begin\npublishing its Equal Employment Opportunity\n(EEO-1) data later this year. We recognize the\nimportance of a diverse workforce to PNC\u2019s\nlong-term success.\n\nAlso driving our success is PNC\u2019s investment\nin talent. Last year, the company continued\nexecuting on its strategic human capital\ngoals, including advancing its talent-focused\nculture by developing strong leaders; focusing\non the development and retention of diverse,\nhigh performing talent; supporting a strong,\nethical culture anchored in PNC\u2019s Corporate\nValues; and focusing on improving workforce\ndiversity and creating an equitable and\ninclusive workplace.\n\nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Environmental, Social and Governance        \n  Progress                                    \n                                              \nEqually important are PNC\u2019s environmental,\nsocial and governance (ESG) efforts, which are\noverseen by our board and outlined in more\ndetail in PNC\u2019s latest Corporate Social\nResponsibility (CSR) Update. PNC\u2019s ability to\neffectively manage such issues, including\nsupporting the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, is critical to our ability to compete\nin the 21st century economy. PNC has made\nconsiderable progress on this front, engaging\ndeeply with stakeholders on ESG issues,\ninvesting in the development of its\nsustainable finance practice, aligning its\nannual CSR report with the Sustainability\nAccounting Standards Board (SASB) framework,\nand demonstrating transparency around climate\nrisk. This transparency can be seen in PNC\u2019s\nendorsement of the recommendations of the Task\nForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD), and perhaps most importantly, the\ncompany\u2019s plan to publish its first TCFD\nreport in the second quarter of this year.\n                                              \n  Remembering Rick Kelson                     \n                                              \nBefore I close, I want to take a moment to\nremember the life of Rick Kelson, who served\non PNC\u2019s board from 2002 through 2020. Rick\nwas a remarkable leader whose vision and\nstrategic guidance helped us grow and become\nwho we are today. His friendship and\nleadership are deeply missed.\n\nThank you again for your support and trust. On\nbehalf of the PNC board, I hope you have a\nsafe, healthy and prosperous year.\n                                              \n  March 16,                                   \n  2021                            Sincerely,  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                  Andrew                      \n                  Feldstein                   \n                  Presiding                   \n                  Director                    \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nPARTICIPATE IN THE FUTURE OF PNC \u2014 PLEASE CAST\nYOUR VOTE\n\nYour vote is important to us and we want your\nshares to be represented at the annual\nmeeting.

the cash\nincentive award paid in 2021 for 2020\nperformance (the \"Non-Equity Incentive Plan\nCompensation\" column) and the long-term\nincentive award granted in 2020 for 2019\nperformance (the \"Stock Awards\" column). The\namounts shown in the \"Stock Awards\" column of\nthe Summary compensation table differ slightly\nfrom the amounts shown in the table above due\nto the impact of rounding related to\nfractional shares. PNC corporate governance\n(page 15) \u2022 The entire Board is elected each\nyear; we have no staggered elections. \u2022 The\nelection of directors is subject to a majority\nvoting requirement; any director who does not\nreceive a majority of the votes cast in an\nuncontested election must tender his or her\nresignation to the Board. \u2022 Our corporate\ngovernance guidelines require the Board to\nhave a substantial majority (at least two-\nthirds) of independent directors. All but one\nof our current directors and all but one of\nthe nominees to the Board are independent,\nwith the only exception in each case being our\nCEO. \u2022 The Board has a Presiding Director, a\nlead independent director with specific\nduties. \u2022 The Presiding Director approves\nBoard meeting agendas. \u2022 The Board meets\nregularly in executive session, with no\nmembers of management present. \u2022 We have four\nprimary standing Board committees: \u2013 Audit\nCommittee \u2013 Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee \u2013 Nominating and Governance\nCommittee \u2013 Risk Committee\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                         3  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY                    \n                                              \n\u2022 The Risk Committee has formed two\nsubcommittees: \u2013 Compliance Subcommittee \u2013\nTechnology Subcommittee \u2022 The Board has also\nformed a Special Committee on Equity &\nInclusion. \u2022 In 2020, the Board met 18 times\nand each director attended at least 75% of the\naggregate number of meetings of the Board and\nall committees of the Board on which he or she\nserved. The average attendance of all\ndirectors at Board and applicable committee\nmeetings was over 98%.

Our By-laws\ncontemplate a range in the size of the Board\nfrom five to 36 directors. For the annual\nmeeting, the Board fixed the number of\ndirectors to be elected at 13.\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Board appointed David\nL. Cohen to serve as a director. Mr. Cohen, a\nprominent figure in the Pennsylvania business\ncommunity, was initially identified as a\ndirector candidate by our CEO, his predecessor\nand several other PNC executives. He was\nappointed to the Board following evaluation\nand nomination by the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee.\n\nEach of the 13 nominees currently serves on\nthe Board, and consents to being named in this\nproxy statement and to serve if elected. The\nBoard has no reason to believe that any\nnominee will be unavailable or unable to serve\nas a director. Each director elected at the\nannual meeting will serve for one year, until\nthe next annual meeting of our shareholders\nand the election and qualification of his or\nher successor, or until his or her earlier\nresignation or removal from the Board. We do\nnot stagger our elections \u2014 the entire Board\nwill be considered for election at the annual\nmeeting.\n\nThe following graphic highlights the skills,\nexperience and demographics of the Board as\ncomprised of the 13 director nominees.\n\nWe recognize the value of a Board that is\ndiverse in perspective and experience. We\nunderstand that diverse boards lead to better\ndecisions and outcomes for our employees,\ncustomers and communities.\n\nIn developing the slate of director nominees,\nthe Board's Nominating and Governance\nCommittee evaluates potential directors for\ndemographic, cognitive, gender and ethnic\ndiversity, as well as breadth of background,\nskills and experience.\n                                              \n  8    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,      \n       INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement             \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS (ITEM 1)              \n                                              \nThe Committee considers the company's strategy\nand industry trends when anticipating the\nskills the Board will need in the future.\n\nAs the financial services industry has\nevolved, so has the Board. Our slate of\ndirector nominees includes senior leaders with\nsubstantial expertise in technology,\ncybersecurity, financial services, regulatory\naffairs, risk management, operations and\nstrategic planning, finance and accounting,\nmarketing and branding, talent management and\nsuccession planning. Of our 13 director\nnominees, all 13 have valuable senior\nleadership experience, 12 are independent,\nfour are women and three bring racial\ndiversity to the Board. The average tenure is\napproximately 5 years, and the Board's\ncommitment to refreshment is evidenced by the\naddition of 10 new directors and 10 director\nretirements since our 2015 annual meeting of\nshareholders.\n\nIn this section, we include the following\ninformation regarding the nominees:\n\n\u2022 Their names and ages\n\n\u2022 The years they first became directors of PNC\n\n\u2022 Their principal occupations and public\ncompany directorships over the past five years\n\n\u2022 A brief discussion of the specific\nexperience, qualifications, attributes or\nskills that led to the Board\u2019s conclusion that\nthe individual should serve as a director\n\nIn addition to information regarding the\nbackground and qualifications of each nominee,\nthis proxy statement contains other important\ninformation related to your evaluation of the\nnominees, including:\n\n\u2022 The Board\u2019s leadership structure\n\n\u2022 How the Board operates\n\n\u2022 Relationships between PNC and our directors\n\n\u2022 How we evaluate director independence\n\n\u2022 How we pay our directors\n\n\u2022 Our director stock ownership requirement\n\nSee the following sections for additional\ndetails on these topics:\n\n\u2022 Corporate Governance (page 15)\n\n\u2022 Director and Executive Officer Relationships\n(page 29)\n\n\u2022 Related Person Transactions (page 34)\n\n\u2022 Director Compensation (page 36)\n\n\u2022 Security Ownership of Management and Certain\nBeneficial Owners (page 80)\n\nIf you sign, date and return your proxy card\nbut do not give voting instructions, or if you\ndo not provide voting instructions when voting\nover the Internet, we will vote your shares\nFOR all of the nominees listed on pages 10 to\n14.

The Board made this determination in\nits business judgment, based on its\ninterpretation of the NYSE\u2019s requirements for\naudit committee members.

The Audit\nCommittee\u2019s responsibility is one of\noversight. Management is responsible for\npreparing our consolidated financial\nstatements, for maintaining internal controls\nand for our compliance with laws and\nregulations, and the independent auditors are\nresponsible for auditing our consolidated\nfinancial statements. The Committee is\nresponsible for holding management accountable\nfor establishing and maintaining an adequate\nand effective internal control system and\nprocesses. The Committee typically approves\nthe internal and external audit plans, and\nreviews and discusses audit reports and\nresults with representatives of our internal\naudit function and our independent auditors.\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to\nretain independent legal, accounting, economic\nor other advisors. The Committee is directly\nresponsible for the selection, appointment,\ncompensation and oversight of our independent\nauditors (including the resolution of any\ndisagreements that may arise between\nmanagement and the independent auditors\nregarding financial reporting) for the purpose\nof preparing or issuing an audit report or\nrelated work. The independent auditors report\ndirectly to the Committee. We describe the\nrole of the Committee as it relates to the\nindependent auditors, including consideration\nof the rotation of the independent audit firm,\nin more detail on page 82. With respect to\nwork performed by the independent auditors,\nthe Audit Committee must approve all audit\nengagement fees and terms, as well as all\npermitted non-audit engagements. The Committee\n(or its delegate) pre-approves all audit\nservices, audit-related services and permitted\nnon-audit services to be performed by the\nindependent auditors.

The Board most\nrecently approved the charter of the\nNominating and Governance Committee on\nNovember 18, 2020, and it is available on our\nwebsite at www.pnc.com/corporategovernance. At\neach quarterly meeting of the full Board, the\nChair of the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee presents a report of the items\ndiscussed and actions approved at previous\nmeetings of the Committee. The primary purpose\nof the Nominating and Governance Committee is\nto assist the Board in promoting the best\ninterests of PNC and its shareholders through\nthe implementation of sound corporate\ngovernance principles and practices. The\nCommittee also assists the Board by\nidentifying individuals qualified to become\nBoard members. The Committee recommends to the\nBoard the director nominees for each annual\nmeeting of shareholders, and may also\nrecommend the appointment of qualified\nindividuals as directors between annual\nmeetings. In addition to conducting its annual\ncommittee self-evaluation, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee oversees the annual\nevaluation of the performance of the Board and\nother Board committees and reports to the\nBoard on the evaluation results as necessary\nor appropriate. The Committee also annually\nreviews and recommends any changes to the\nExecutive Committee charter. How we evaluate\ndirectors and director candidates . At least\nannually, the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee assesses the skills, qualifications\nand experience of our directors and recommends\na slate of director nominees to the Board. In\nevaluating existing directors and new director\ncandidates, the Committee assesses the needs\nof the Board and the qualifications of the\nindividual. From time to time, the Committee\nalso considers whether to change the\ncomposition of the Board. See the discussion\non pages 8 to 14 for additional information\nregarding each of our current director\nnominees. The Board and its committees must\nsatisfy SEC, NYSE and banking regulatory\nstandards. At least a majority of our\ndirectors must be independent under NYSE\nstandards. Our corporate governance guidelines\nimpose a more rigorous standard and require\nthat a substantial majority (at least two-\nthirds) of our directors be independent. We\nrequire a sufficient number of independent\ndirectors to satisfy the membership needs of\nBoard committees that also require\nindependence. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee expects directors to gain a sound\nunderstanding of our strategic vision, our mix\nof businesses and our approach to regulatory\nrelations and risk management. The Board must\npossess a mix of qualities and skills adequate\nto address the various risks facing PNC. For a\ndiscussion of the Board\u2019s oversight of risk,\nsee Corporate Governance\u2014Board committees\u2014Risk\nCommittee on page 26. When evaluating each\ndirector, as well as new director candidates\nfor nomination, the Committee considers the\nfollowing criteria set forth in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines: \u2022 A sustained record of\nhigh achievement in financial services,\nbusiness, industry, government, academia, the\nprofessions, or civic, charitable or non-\nprofit organizations \u2022 Manifest competence and\nintegrity \u2022 A strong commitment to the ethical\nand diligent pursuit of shareholders\u2019 best\ninterests \u2022 The strength of character\nnecessary to challenge management\u2019s\nrecommendations and actions when appropriate\nand to confirm the adequacy and completeness\nof management\u2019s responses to such challenges\nto his or her satisfaction \u2022 The Board\u2019s\nstrong desire to maintain its diversity in\nterms of race and gender \u2022 Personal qualities\nthat will help to sustain an atmosphere of\nmutual respect and collegiality among the\nmembers of the Board The Nominating and\nGovernance Committee also considers the\ncurrent needs of the Board and its committees,\nmeeting attendance and participation, and the\nvalue of a director\u2019s contribution to the\neffectiveness of the Board and its committees.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        21  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nAlthough the Board has not adopted a formal\npolicy on diversity, the Board recognizes the\nvalue of a diverse Board. Therefore, the\nNominating and Governance Committee considers\nthe diversity of directors in the context of\nthe Board\u2019s overall needs, including the\ndiversity of perspective, experience,\nknowledge, education, age and skills of each\ndirector. The Committee evaluates diversity in\na broad sense, recognizing the benefits of\ndemographic and cognitive diversity, and the\nbreadth of diverse backgrounds, skills and\nexperiences the directors bring to the Board.\n                                              \n  How we identify new directors               \n                                              \n. The Nominating and Governance Committee\nutilizes as a discussion tool a matrix of\ncertain skills and experiences the Committee\nbelieves would be beneficial to have\nrepresented on the Board and its committees.\nThe Committee considers PNC's strategy and\nindustry trends in developing a view of those\nskills and characteristics that would benefit\nthe Board. The Committee is also focused on\nwhat skills are required or beneficial for\nthose serving in key Board positions such as\ncommittee chairs, and considers succession\nplanning for those positions. The Committee\nleverages the matrix, and considers the Board-\napproved evaluation criteria and various\nregulatory requirements described above, when\nidentifying potential director candidates,\nwhich it does in a number of ways. The\nCommittee may consider recommendations made by\nour current or former directors or members of\nexecutive management. The Committee may also\nidentify potential directors through contacts\nin the business, civic, academic, legal and\nnon-profit communities. The Committee\nperiodically retains a search firm to identify\ncandidates.\n\nIn addition, the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee will consider director candidates\nrecommended by our shareholders for nomination\nat the next year\u2019s annual meeting of\nshareholders. For the Committee to consider a\ndirector candidate recommended by a\nshareholder, the shareholder must submit the\nrecommendation in writing to the Corporate\nSecretary at our principal executive offices.\nThe submission must include the information\ndescribed under \u201cDirector Nomination Process\u201d\nin Section 3 of our corporate governance\nguidelines, which can be found at\nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance . To be\nconsidered for the 2022 annual meeting of\nshareholders, the submission must be received\nby November 16, 2021.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will\nevaluate director candidates recommended by a\nshareholder in the same manner as candidates\nidentified by the Committee or recommended by\nothers. The Committee will not consider any\ncandidate with an obvious impediment to\nserving as one of our directors.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will\nmeet to review and discuss relevant available\ninformation regarding a director candidate,\nconsidering the Board-approved evaluation\ncriteria, the candidate's contribution to the\ndiversity of the Board and PNC's evolving\nstrategic needs. If the Committee decides not\nto recommend a candidate for nomination or\nappointment, or for additional evaluation, no\nfurther action is taken, and in the case of a\nshareholder-recommended candidate, the\nCorporate Secretary will communicate the\ndecision to the shareholder.\n\nIf the Nominating and Governance Committee\ndecides to recommend a director candidate to\nthe Board as a nominee for election at an\nannual meeting of shareholders or for\nappointment by the Board, the Chair of the\nCommittee will report that decision to the\nfull Board. Following a discussion regarding\nthe recommendation, the full Board will vote\non whether to nominate the candidate for\nelection or appoint the candidate to the\nBoard, as applicable. Invitations to join the\nBoard are extended by the Chairman of the\nBoard and the Presiding Director, jointly\nacting on behalf of the Board.\n\nShareholders who wish to nominate a director\ncandidate directly at an annual meeting of\nshareholders or nominate and include a\ndirector candidate in our annual meeting proxy\nmaterials must do so in accordance with the\nprocedures contained in our By-laws, as\ndescribed in Shareholder Proposals for the\n2022 Annual Meeting on page 93 under the\nheadings Advance notice procedures and Proxy\naccess procedures, respectively.\n                                              \n  22    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nPersonnel and Compensation Committee\n                                              \n              Chair                Other      \n                                   members:   \n  Charles              Debra A.               \n  E.

The Committee may also evaluate and\napprove, or recommend for approval, benefit,\nincentive compensation, severance, equity-\nbased or other compensation plans, policies\nand programs. The Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee has the authority to retain\nindependent legal, compensation, accounting or\nother advisors. The charter provides the\nCommittee with the sole authority to retain\nand terminate an independent compensation\nconsultant acting on the Committee\u2019s behalf,\nand to approve the consultant\u2019s fees and other\nretention terms. The Committee retained an\nindependent compensation consultant in 2020\nand prior years. See Role of compensation\nconsultants below. The Personnel and\nCompensation Committee reviews with management\nthe Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nsection of the proxy statement, which begins\non page 38. The Compensation Committee Report\nis included on page 59. The Committee also\nevaluates the relationship between risk\nmanagement and our incentive compensation\nprograms and plans. See Compensation and Risk\nbeginning on page 60. The Personnel and\nCompensation Committee has responsibility for\nreviewing our talent and human capital\nstrategy, and for reviewing and evaluating our\nexecutive management succession plan (except\nfor the review and evaluation of the\nsuccession plans for the General Auditor and\nChief Risk Officer, which are performed by the\nAudit Committee and the Risk Committee,\nrespectively). The executive management\nsuccession plan, including for the CEO, is\nreviewed with the full Board. The Committee\nreviews a detailed succession planning report\nat least annually. The materials in the report\ntypically include a discussion of the\nindividual performance of each executive\nofficer, as well as succession plans and\ndevelopment initiatives for other emerging\ntalent. These materials provide necessary\nbackground and context to the Committee, and\ngive each Committee member a familiarity with\nthe employee\u2019s position, duties,\nresponsibilities and performance. How we make\ndecisions . The Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee meets at least four times a year.\nBefore each meeting, the Chair of the\nCommittee reviews the agenda, materials and\nissues with members of management and the\nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation\nconsultant, as appropriate. The Committee may\ninvite legal counsel or other external\nconsultants to advise the Committee during\nmeetings and preparatory sessions. The\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee regularly\nmeets in executive sessions without management\npresent. At each quarterly meeting of the full\nBoard, the Chair of the Committee presents a\nreport of the items discussed and actions\napproved at previous meetings of the\nCommittee. The Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee has adopted guidelines for\ninformation that will be presented to the\nCommittee. The guidelines contemplate, among\nother things, that any material change to a\ncompensation program, plan or arrangement will\nbe considered over the course of at least two\nseparate meetings of the Committee, with any\nvote occurring no earlier than the second\nmeeting. The Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee reviews all of the elements of our\ncompensation programs periodically and adjusts\nthose programs as appropriate. Each year, the\nCommittee makes decisions regarding the amount\nof annual compensation and equity-based or\nother longer-term compensation for our\nexecutive officers and other designated senior\nemployees. For the most part, these decisions\nare made in the first quarter of each year,\nfollowing an evaluation of the prior year\u2019s\nperformance. Delegations of authority . The\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee has\ndelegated authority to management to make\ncertain decisions or take certain actions with\nrespect to compensation or benefit plans or\narrangements, other than those that are solely\nor predominantly for the benefit of executive\nofficers. For employee benefit, bonus,\nincentive compensation,\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        23  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nseverance, equity-based and other compensation\nor incentive plans and arrangements, the\nCommittee has delegated to the Chief Human\nResources Officer (or her designee) the\nability to adopt a new plan or arrangement or\namend an existing one if:\n\n\u2022 the adoption or amendment is not expected to\nresult in a significant increase in\nincremental expense to PNC (defined as an\nincremental annual expense that exceeds $50\nmillion for that plan category), the plan is\nbroadly available to employees and the new\nplan or amendment would not confer a\ndisproportionate benefit upon executives; or\n\n\u2022 the new plan or amendment is of a technical\nor administrative nature, is required by a\nchange in applicable law, is not otherwise\nmaterial or, with respect to employee benefit\nplans, will not result in a significant impact\non PNC's overall employee benefits program.\n\nThis delegation also includes the authority to\ntake certain actions to implement, administer,\ninterpret or construe, or make eligibility\ndeterminations under, the plans and\narrangements, including the ability to appoint\na plan manager, administrator or committee and\nto adopt policies and procedures with respect\nto the plan, except with respect to plans that\nare overseen by the PNC administrative\ncommittee under its charter.\n\nFor grants of equity or equity-based awards,\nthe Personnel and Compensation Committee has\ndelegated to the CEO and the Chief Human\nResources Officer (or the designee of either)\nthe responsibility to make decisions with\nrespect to equity grants for individuals who\nare not designated by the Committee as\nexecutives, including the determination of\nparticipants and grant sizes, allocation of\nthe pool from which grants will be made,\nestablishment and documentation of the terms\nand conditions of such grants, approval of\namendments to outstanding grants (subject to\nany limitations set forth in the applicable\nplan or the Committee's delegation of\nauthority) and exercise of any discretionary\nauthority provided to PNC or the Committee\npursuant to the terms of the grants and the\napplicable plan.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Risk Committee (or\nin the case of equity-based grants, a\nqualified subcommittee of the Risk Committee)\nhave the authority to award compensation under\napplicable plans to our General Auditor and\nour Chief Risk Officer, respectively.\n                                              \n  Management\u2019s role in compensation           \n  decisions                                   \n                                              \n. Our executive officers, including the CEO\nand the Chief Human Resources Officer, often\nreview compensation information with the\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee during\nCommittee meetings and may present\nmanagement\u2019s views or recommendations. The\nCommittee evaluates these recommendations,\ngenerally in consultation with an independent\ncompensation consultant retained by the\nCommittee who attends each meeting.\n\nThe Chair of the Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee typically meets with management and\nan independent compensation consultant before\neach meeting of the Committee to discuss\nagenda topics, areas of focus or outstanding\nissues. The Chair of the Committee schedules\nother meetings with the Committee\u2019s\nindependent compensation consultant without\nmanagement present as needed. Occasionally,\nmanagement will schedule meetings with the\nChair of the Committee or other Committee\nmembers to discuss substantive issues. For\nmore complicated issues, these one-on-one\nmeetings provide a dedicated forum for\nCommittee members to ask questions outside of\nthe meeting environment.\n\nDuring Personnel and Compensation Committee\nmeetings, the CEO often reviews corporate and\nindividual performance as part of the\ncompensation discussions, and other members of\nexecutive management may be invited to speak\nto the Committee about specific elements of\nperformance or risk management. Our Chief Risk\nOfficer regularly presents to the Committee\nregarding risk management, including its\nimpact on the Committee\u2019s discussions and\ndecisions regarding executive compensation.\nThe Committee reviews compensation decisions\nfor the Chief Human Resources Officer and the\nCEO in executive session, without either\nofficer present for the discussion of their\ncompensation. Any decisions on CEO\ncompensation are also discussed with the full\nBoard in executive session.\n                                              \n  Role of compensation consultants            \n                                              \n. The Personnel and Compensation Committee has\nthe sole authority to retain and terminate any\ncompensation consultant directly assisting it.\nThe Committee also has the sole authority to\napprove fees and other engagement terms. The\nCommittee receives comparative compensation\ndata from management, from proxy statements\nand other public disclosures, and through\nsurveys and reports prepared by compensation\nconsultants.\n\nThe Personnel and Compensation Committee\nretained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC\n(\"Meridian\") as its independent compensation\nconsultant for 2020. In this capacity,\nMeridian reported directly to the Committee.\nIn 2020, one or more representatives of\nMeridian attended all meetings of the\nCommittee, and met regularly with the\nCommittee without members of management\npresent. Meridian also reviewed meeting\nagendas and materials prepared by management.\n\nMeridian and members of management assisted\nthe Personnel and Compensation Committee in\nits review of proposed compensation packages\nfor our executive officers. For the 2020\nperformance year, Meridian prepared discussion\nmaterials for the compensation of the CEO,\nwhich were reviewed in executive session.\nMeridian also prepared other benchmarking\nreviews and pay for performance analyses for\nthe Committee. PNC paid no fees to Meridian in\n2020 other than fees paid in connection with\nwork performed by Meridian for the Committee.\n                                              \n  24    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nThe Personnel and Compensation Committee\nevaluated whether the work of Meridian raised\nany conflicts of interest. The Committee\nconsidered various factors, including the six\nfactors mandated by SEC rules, and determined\nthat no conflict of interest was raised by the\nwork performed by Meridian for the Committee.\n\nManagement retains other compensation\nconsultants for its own use. In 2020,\nmanagement retained McLagan to provide certain\nmarket data in the financial services\nindustry. Management also engages Willis\nTowers Watson, a global professional services\nfirm, to provide various actuarial and\nmanagement consulting services from time to\ntime, including:\n\n\u2022 Preparing specific actuarial calculations on\nvalues under our retirement plans\n\n\u2022 Preparing surveys of competitive pay\npractices\n\n\u2022 Analyzing our director compensation packages\nand providing related reports to management\nand the Nominating and Governance Committee\n\n\u2022 Providing insurance brokerage and consulting\nservices to mitigate certain property and\ncasualty risks\n\n\u2022 Providing guidance on certain aspects of\ntotal rewards, talent management and other\nhuman resources initiatives\n\nReports prepared by Willis Towers Watson and\nMcLagan that relate to executive compensation\nmay also be shared with the Personnel and\nCompensation Committee.\n\nCompensation committee interlocks and insider\nparticipation . During 2020, the members of\nthe Personnel and Compensation Committee\nincluded Charles E. Bunch, Debra A. Cafaro,\nDavid L. Cohen, Andrew T. Feldstein, Richard\nJ. Harshman, Richard B.

During 2020, no executive\nofficer of PNC served on the board of\ndirectors or compensation committee (or other\nboard committee performing equivalent\nfunctions) of an entity that had an executive\nofficer who served on the Board or the\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee.\n\nCertain members of the Personnel and\nCompensation Committee, their immediate family\nmembers or entities with which they are\naffiliated were our customers or had\ntransactions with us (or our subsidiaries)\nduring 2020. Transactions that involved loans\nor commitments by subsidiary banks were made\nin the ordinary course of business on\nsubstantially the same terms, including\ninterest rates and collateral, as those\nprevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with other persons and did not\ninvolve more than the normal risk of\ncollectability or present other unfavorable\nfeatures, and otherwise complied with\nregulatory restrictions applicable to such\ntransactions.\n\nFor additional information, see Director and\nExecutive Officer Relationships\u2014Regulation O\npolicies and procedures beginning on page 32.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        25  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                       \n                                              \nRisk Committee\n                                              \n           Chair             Other            \n                             membe\u2026           \n  Mart\u2026             Marj\u2026              Dani\u2026  \n  Pfin\u2026             Rodg\u2026              R.     \n                    Ches\u2026              Hesse  \n                    Will\u2026              Linda  \n                    S.

The Board most recently approved\nthe charter of the Risk Committee on February\n11, 2021, and it is available on our website\nat www.pnc.com/corporategovernance. The Risk\nCommittee\u2019s purpose is to require and oversee\nthe establishment and implementation of our\nenterprise-wide risk governance framework,\nincluding related policies, procedures,\nactivities and processes to identify, assess,\nmonitor and manage material risks at PNC\n(except for accounting and financial reporting\nrisk exposures and related reputational risks,\nwhich are the responsibility of the Audit\nCommittee). The Risk Committee\u2019s\nresponsibility is one of oversight, and the\nCommittee has no duty to assure compliance\nwith laws and regulations. The Risk Committee\nserves as the primary point of contact between\nthe Board and the management-level committees\ndealing with risk management. The Committee\nreceives regular reports on enterprise-wide\nrisk management and capital and liquidity\nmanagement, as well as credit, operational,\nline of business, model and reputational\nrisks. At each quarterly meeting of the full\nBoard, the Chair of the Risk Committee\npresents a report of the items discussed and\nactions approved at previous meetings of the\nCommittee. The Risk Committee also appoints\nour Chief Risk Officer, who leads our risk\nmanagement function. The Committee reviews the\nperformance and approves the compensation of\nthe Chief Risk Officer, except with respect to\nhis equity-based grants, which are approved by\na qualified subcommittee of the Risk\nCommittee. The Committee reviews the Chief\nRisk Officer's succession plan with the CEO\nannually and with the Board from time to time.\nThe Risk Committee, along with the Personnel\nand Compensation Committee, reviews the risk\ncomponents of our incentive compensation\nplans. For a discussion of the relationship\nbetween compensation and risk, see\nCompensation and Risk beginning on page 60.\nSubcommittees . The Risk Committee may form\nsubcommittees as appropriate from time to\ntime. The Risk Committee has formed a\nTechnology Subcommittee to assist in\nfulfilling the Committee\u2019s oversight\nresponsibilities with respect to technology\nrisk, cybersecurity, information security,\nphysical security, business continuity and\nsignificant technology initiatives and\nprograms, including those that can position\nthe use of technology to drive strategic\nadvantage.

If a relationship\ninvolving a director meets the criteria\noutlined in the guidelines, the Board may\naffirm the director\u2019s independence without\nfurther analysis of that relationship,\nprovided that the director otherwise meets the\nrelevant independence tests. These guidelines\nare included in our corporate governance\nguidelines, which can be found on our website\nat www.pnc.com/corporategovernance.\n\nThe four categories of relationships described\nin the director independence guidelines\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Ordinary course business relationships, such\nas lending, deposit, banking or other\nfinancial service relationships, or other\nrelationships involving the provision of\nproducts or services by or to PNC or its\nsubsidiaries and involving a director, an\nimmediate family member, or an affiliated\nentity of a director or immediate family\nmember, where such relationships satisfy the\ncriteria described in the guidelines\n\n\u2022 Contributions made by PNC, its subsidiaries\nor a PNC-sponsored foundation to a charitable\norganization of which a director or an\nimmediate family member is an executive\nofficer, director or trustee, subject to the\nconditions described in the guidelines\n\n\u2022 Relationships involving a director\u2019s\nrelative who is not an immediate family member\n\n\u2022 Relationships or transactions between PNC or\nits subsidiaries and a company or charitable\norganization where a director or an immediate\nfamily member serves solely as a non-\nmanagement board member or trustee or where an\nimmediate family member is employed in a non-\nofficer position\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        29  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER             \n   RELATIONSHIPS                              \n                                              \nThe director independence guidelines also\nallow investors to understand the\nconsiderations underlying the Board\u2019s\nindependence determinations.\n\nIn applying these guidelines, an \u201cimmediate\nfamily member\u201d includes a person\u2019s spouse,\nparents, children, siblings, mothers- and\nfathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law,\nbrothers- and sisters-in-law, and anyone\n(other than domestic employees) who shares\nsuch person\u2019s home.\n\nIf a director has a relationship that would\nnot be considered material under our director\nindependence guidelines but is one of the\nrelationships described in the NYSE\u2019s bright-\nline independence tests, the NYSE rules govern\nand the director will not qualify as\nindependent.\n                                              \n  The Board\u2019s independence determinations     \n                                              \n. At a meeting held on February 11, 2021, the\nBoard made an independence determination for\neach of our directors, including our director\nnominees. In making these determinations, the\nBoard relied on the evaluation and\nrecommendations made by the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee. The Board considered\nrelevant facts and circumstances, including an\nevaluation of the relationships described in\nthis proxy statement.\n\nIn some cases, the relationships the Board\nevaluated included relationships a director\nhas as a partner, member, shareholder, officer\nor employee of an organization that has a\nrelationship with PNC. The relationships\nevaluated may have also included relationships\nwhere an immediate family member of a director\nis a partner, member, shareholder or officer\nof an organization that has a relationship\nwith PNC.\n\nThe Board based its independence decisions on\ninformation known as of February 11, 2021.\nEach director has been asked to provide\nupdates regarding any changes in circumstances\nthat could impact the director\u2019s status as an\nindependent director.

An employee or an immediate family member\nmay want to engage in a business arrangement,\nsuch as the sale or lease of property or the\nprovision of services, with PNC.

We prohibit directors and employees from\ntransacting business on behalf of PNC with a\nsupplier or customer in which the director,\nemployee or an extended family member has a\nsignificant personal or financial interest. We\nalso prohibit directors and employees from\ntransacting business on behalf of PNC with\nrespect to their own accounts, extended family\nmember accounts or accounts for anyone whose\nclose relationship may reasonably be viewed as\ncreating a conflict of interest. Our phrase\n\u201cextended family member\u201d is similar to the\nSEC\u2019s definition of \u201cimmediate family member\u201d\nin Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

Our employment of a\ndirector\u2019s relative is also a factor in the\ndetermination of the director\u2019s independence\nunder NYSE rules and our own adopted\nguidelines regarding director independence.\nSee Director and Executive Officer\nRelationships\u2014Director independence beginning\non page 29.\n                                              \n  Waivers                                     \n                                              \n.

For credit extensions under a\nbenefit or compensatory program widely\navailable to all employees, we may not give\npreference to any covered individual\n\n\u2022 The covered extension of credit be made\nfollowing credit underwriting procedures no\nless stringent than those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable transactions with non-\ncovered individuals or entities. The extension\nof credit may not involve more than the normal\nrisk of repayment or present other unfavorable\nfeatures\n\n\u2022 The amount of covered extensions of credit\ndo not exceed individual and aggregate lending\nlimits, depending on the identity of the\nborrower and the nature of the loan\n\nOur subsidiary bank, PNC Bank, National\nAssociation, has a Regulation O Credit Officer\nwho reviews extensions of credit to determine\nour compliance with these policies. If an\nextension of credit would result in an\naggregate credit extension of more than\n$500,000, the bank\u2019s Board of Directors must\napprove it.

Our policy for the\nreview and approval of related person\ntransactions was most recently approved on\nAugust 10, 2020.\n\nThis policy provides guidance on the framework\nfor reviewing potential related person\ntransactions and approving or ratifying\nrelated person transactions, and establishes\nour Presiding Director as the individual who\ndecides how transactions should be evaluated.\n\nIn general, a potential related person\ntransaction that involves a director would be\nreviewed by the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, as the transaction could also\nimpact independence. A transaction that\ninvolves an executive officer or beneficial\nowner of more than 5% of our common stock\nwould generally be reviewed by the Audit\nCommittee. The full Board receives reports on\napproved, disapproved and ratified\ntransactions. Under the policy, a permitted\nrelated person transaction must be considered\nto be in, or not inconsistent with, the best\ninterests of PNC and its shareholders and must\nbe on terms comparable to those that could be\nobtained in arm's length dealings with an\nunrelated third party.\n                                              \n  Certain related person transactions         \n                                              \nWe have a contract to purchase carpeting from\nInterface Americas, Inc.

Mr. Demchak\nreceives no additional compensation for\nserving as a PNC director. In addition to\nannual compensation, the Committee may approve\nspecial compensation to a director for\nextraordinary service. The primary objectives\nof the Committee\u2019s annual review are to\nconfirm continued alignment with business and\nshareholder interests, evaluate the\ncompetitiveness of our director compensation\nprogram relative to the peer group, and\nidentify and respond to continued changes in\ndirector compensation in light of the\ncompetitive environment. The Committee\nconducted its annual compensation review for\n2020 on April 28, 2020, and updated the non-\nemployee director compensation program on\nAugust 11, 2020 solely to add the Special\nCommittee on Equity & Inclusion to the list of\ncommittees whose chairperson is entitled to\nreceive an additional annual retainer as\nreflected below.\n\nThe following table describes the components\nof non-employee director compensation in 2020:\n                                              \n  Annual Retainer                             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Each director                   $   90,000  \n  Additional retainer for         $   30,000  \n  Presiding Director                          \n  Additional retainer for                     \n  Chairs of Audit,                            \n  Nominating and Governance,                  \n  Personnel and                   $   25,000  \n  Compensation, Risk, and                     \n  Equity & Inclusion                          \n  Committees                                  \n  Additional retainer for                     \n  Chairs of Compliance            $   25,000  \n  Subcommittee and Technology                 \n  Subcommittee                                \n  Meeting Fees                                \n  (Committee/Subcommittee)                    \n  First six meetings              $    1,500  \n  Each additional meeting         $    2,000  \n  Equity-Based Grants                         \n  Value of 1,368 deferred                     \n  stock units awarded as of       $  144,994  \n  April 28, 2020                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Deferred compensation plans.                \n                                              \nOur non-management directors may choose to\ndefer the compensation they receive for\nmeeting fees and retainers under our Directors\nDeferred Compensation Plan. Under this plan,\nthe directors may elect to defer compensation\ninto an account that tracks the price of PNC\ncommon stock or an interest rate defined in\nthe plan. The accounts that track the price of\nPNC common stock are credited with a number of\nunits (including fractional shares) that could\nhave been purchased with the equivalent of PNC\ncommon stock cash dividends. We do not pay\nabove-market or preferential earnings on any\ndirector compensation that is deferred. The\ndirectors may choose the payout date and\nwhether the payout, which is made in cash,\nwill be in a lump sum or up to 10 annual\ninstallment payments.\n\nUnder the Outside Directors Deferred Stock\nUnit Program, a subprogram of the 2016\nIncentive Award Plan, each non-employee\ndirector is eligible to receive an annual\ngrant of deferred stock units that vest\nimmediately upon grant and are paid out in\nshares of PNC common stock at retirement. The\ndeferred stock units accrue dividends with\nreinvestment equal to the number of units that\ncould have been purchased with the equivalent\nof PNC common stock cash dividends (rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share).\n                                              \n  Other director benefits.                    \n                                              \nWe generally limit the benefits we provide to\nour directors, but we regularly provide the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Charitable matching gifts . We will match a\nnon-employee director\u2019s personal gifts to\nqualifying charities up to a limit of $5,000\nper year.\n\n\u2022 Insurance policies . We pay for various\ninsurance policies that protect directors and\ntheir families from personal loss connected\nwith Board service.\n\n\u2022 Expenses related to Board service . We pay\nfor expenses connected with our directors\u2019\nBoard service, including travel on corporate,\nprivate or commercial aircraft, lodging, meals\nand incidentals.\n\nWe may also provide other incidental benefits\nto our directors from time to time, including\ntickets to cultural, social, sporting or other\nevents and small gifts for holidays, birthdays\nor special occasions. In limited\ncircumstances, we may also provide travel for\ndirectors on corporate aircraft for personal\npurposes, such as when a family emergency\narises or a seat is available on a previously\nscheduled flight. We determine the value of\nthese benefits based on the incremental cost\nto PNC and we include the amount in the \u201cAll\nOther Compensation\u201d column of the Director\ncompensation in 2020 table below.\n                                              \n  Director stock ownership requirement.       \n                                              \nThe Board has adopted a common stock purchase\nguideline for our non-management directors.\nUnder this guideline, each director must own\nshares of PNC common stock (including phantom\nstock units) with a value of at least five\ntimes the value of his or her annual base\nretainer.

The Personnel and\nCompensation Committee (referred to in this\nCD&A as the \"Committee\") relies on defined\nprinciples to help guide its executive\ncompensation decisions:\n                                              \n  COMPEN\u2026                                     \n  PRINCI\u2026                                     \n                         Manage     Discour\u2026  \n  Pay for    Create      talent     excessi\u2026  \n  perfor\u2026    value       Provide    risk-ta\u2026  \n  Provide    Align       compet\u2026    Encoura\u2026  \n  approp\u2026    executi\u2026    compen\u2026    focus on  \n  compen\u2026    compens\u2026    opport\u2026    the       \n  for        with        to         long-te\u2026  \n  demons\u2026    long-te\u2026    attrac\u2026    success   \n  perfor\u2026    shareho\u2026    retain     of PNC    \n  across     value       and        and       \n  the        creation    motiva\u2026    discour\u2026  \n  enterp\u2026                high-q\u2026    excessi\u2026  \n                         execut\u2026    risk-ta\u2026  \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the successful\napplication of these principles requires a\nthoughtful program design, which includes a\nbalanced evaluation of performance. The\nCommittee believes that discretion,\nflexibility and judgment are critical to its\nability to award incentive compensation that\nreflects near-term performance results and\nprogress toward longer-term strategic\npriorities that allow PNC to create value for\nour shareholders. See Evaluating performance\nto determine incentive compensation beginning\non page 43 for more information on how the\nCommittee balances its evaluation of\nperformance.\n                                              \n  Key program features                        \n                                              \nThe Committee reviews and approves the\ncompensation to be paid to our NEOs. We seek\nclarity and transparency in our compensation\nstructure, using features that we believe will\nhelp to create a balanced program. While we\nconsider the expectations of various\nstakeholders, we want our compensation program\nto achieve multiple objectives, consistent\nwith our compensation principles. The\nCommittee also regularly reviews the operation\nof our compensation program to help ensure\nthat our objectives continue to be met.\n                                              \n  40    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC. -2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nTaken as a whole, our executive compensation\nprogram includes several complementary\nfeatures:\n                                              \n  We provide incentives for performance over  \n  different time horizons (short- and         \n  long-term).                                 \n  We embed performance goals into a           \n  significant                                 \n  portion of our long-term incentives \u2014 and   \n  include                                     \n  a risk-based performance review that could  \n  reduce                                      \n  or eliminate the awards.                    \n  We reward achievement against both          \n  quantitative                                \n  and qualitative goals, while allowing for   \n  discretion.                                 \n  We connect pay to company performance,      \n  relative to                                 \n  our internal objectives and controls, as    \n  well as                                     \n  relative to the performance of a carefully  \n  selected peer group.                        \n  We consider market data and trends when     \n  making pay                                  \n  decisions.                                  \n  We place a substantial majority of          \n  compensation at                             \n  risk.                                       \n  We pay some incentive compensation in cash  \n  today,                                      \n  while deferring most of our incentives for  \n  several                                     \n  years through potential equity-based        \n  payouts.                                    \n                                              \nThe following table illustrates some important\nfeatures of our executive compensation\nprogram:\n                                              \n  WHAT WE                WHAT WE              \n  DO                     DON\u2019T                \n                         DO                   \n                                    We do     \n                                    not       \n                                    allow     \n                                    tax       \n                                    gross-u\u2026  \n                                    do not    \n                                    provide   \n                                    excise    \n             We pay                 tax       \n             for                    gross-u\u2026  \n             perform\u2026               in our    \n             link                   current   \n             most of                change    \n             our                    of        \n             executi\u2026               control   \n             pay to                 agreeme\u2026  \n             perform\u2026               and we    \n             includi\u2026               have      \n             financi\u2026    \u00fb          elimina\u2026  \n             and                    these     \n             operati\u2026               gross-u\u2026  \n             perform\u2026               from all  \n             measure\u2026               existing  \n             qualita\u2026               change    \n             measures               of        \n             and                    control   \n             risk-ba\u2026               agreeme\u2026  \n             metrics.

For\ninformation on how the 2020 incentive\ncompensation decisions by the Committee\ncompared to the incentive compensation\ntargets, see pages 49 to 50.\n\nThe Committee believes that an effective\nexecutive compensation program requires a\ncomprehensive evaluation of performance across\nmultiple categories. This evaluation generally\nincludes a review of financial performance,\nhow we executed against our strategic\nobjectives, and how we manage risk, customer\nexperience and leadership.\n\nThe Committee has not adopted a formula-driven\ncompensation program, believing that formulas\nmay reward short-term results or behaviors\nthat do not serve the long-term interests of\nour shareholders. Metrics that rely on\nformulas may also be inappropriately skewed by\nresults outside of management's control.\nFinally, formulas may undervalue important\nstrategic objectives that do not translate to\neasily or immediately quantifiable metrics.\n\nTo the extent possible, the performance\nmetrics reviewed by the Committee align the\nobjectives of our management, long-term\nshareholders and federal banking regulators.\nIn some cases, these stakeholders have\ndifferent objectives that cannot be easily\nreconciled \u2014 for example, long-term\nshareholders seeking higher returns may be\nwilling to tolerate more risk than a federal\nbanking regulator would accept. That is one\nreason we use multiple metrics, representing\nachievement against a range of goals, as well\nas significant adjustments for risk\nmanagement. The Committee does not necessarily\nfavor one metric over another. Instead, the\nCommittee uses these metrics to gain a\ncomprehensive understanding of our overall\nperformance.\n\nFollowing each quarter, the Committee reviews\nPNC's performance with the CEO. Following the\nend of the year, the CEO reviews the annual\nperformance with the Committee.

The Committee\nmade these grants to NEOs in the first quarter\nof 2021 (for 2020 performance) and in the\nfirst quarter of 2020 (for 2019 performance).\nThese awards, and all other equity-based\nawards, are made under PNC\u2019s shareholder-\napproved 2016 Incentive Award Plan.\n\nThe table below summarizes the material terms\nand conditions of the awards granted in 2021\nfor 2020 performance (these terms and\nconditions do not differ from the terms and\nconditions of the awards granted in 2020 for\n2019 performance):\n                                              \n                                 Pay\u2026    St\u2026  \n  Na\u2026    % of    Ves\u2026            Ran\u2026    or   \n  of     LTI     Sch\u2026    Met\u2026    (%      Ca\u2026  \n  Aw\u2026    Val\u2026                    of      Pa\u2026  \n                                 tar\u2026         \n                         PNC\u2026                 \n                         ret\u2026                 \n                 Aft\u2026    on                   \n                 3-y\u2026    equ\u2026                 \n  PSU    60%     per\u2026    (RO\u2026    0\u20131\u2026    St\u2026  \n                 per\u2026    com\u2026                 \n                 ends    to                   \n                         per\u2026                 \n                         tar\u2026                 \n  EPS                                         \n  gr\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n  ag\u2026                                         \n  our                                         \n  pe\u2026                                         \n  gr\u2026                                         \n                 Ann\u2026                         \n                 ins\u2026                         \n  RSU    40%     over    Tim\u2026    0\u20131\u2026    St\u2026  \n                 3                            \n                 yea\u2026                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  PSUs.                                       \n                                              \nWith respect to 2020 performance, in the first\nquarter of 2021 the Committee granted to\ncertain of our senior executives, including\nall NEOs, PSUs that represent an opportunity\nto receive shares of PNC common stock. The\npayout is based on how PNC performs against\ntwo corporate performance metrics over a\nthree-year performance period. Performance\nagainst these two metrics generates a\npercentage (the corporate performance factor).\nThe award may be decreased if PNC fails to\nsatisfy a risk performance metric or based on\na discretionary risk performance review\nconducted by the Committee. After applying any\nrisk-related performance adjustment (and if\nPNC satisfies the risk performance metric),\nthe resulting percentage is applied to the\nnumber of target PSUs to determine the final\nnumber of units available for settlement. The\nPSUs have a maximum payout opportunity of 150%\nof target. Payout of any award under the PSUs\nalso requires the satisfaction of service\nrequirements and other award conditions.\n\nThe Committee may also increase or decrease\nthe size of the final payout to maintain the\nintended economics of the award, if\ncircumstances change. These circumstances\ninclude external events affecting PNC or\nmembers of its peer group or its financial\nstatements that are outside of PNC's control\nand not reasonably anticipated.\n\nThe two corporate performance metrics include\nan absolute metric (an internal PNC\nmeasurement against a target) and a relative\nmetric (PNC performance against peers). The\nabsolute metric is PNC's three-year average\nreturn on equity (\"ROE\"), as adjusted,\ncompared to three-year ROE performance targets\nestablished in advance by the Committee. The\nrelative metric is PNC's three-year average\nearnings per share (\"EPS\") growth, as\nadjusted, compared to the three-year average\nEPS growth of PNC peers.\n                                              \n  44    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nThe ROE metric will be calculated annually for\neach year of the performance period. At the\nend of the three-year performance period,\naverage ROE for the performance period will be\ndetermined as the average of PNC's annual ROE\nfor each year. In establishing the ROE\nperformance targets, the Committee considers\nmultiple factors, including our historical\nperformance, budget and future growth\nexpectations, peer results, cost of capital\nand analyst expectations.\n\nThe EPS growth metric will be calculated for\neach year of the performance period. At the\nend of the three-year performance period, the\nannual EPS growth percentages will be\naveraged. PNC's three-year average EPS growth\nwill be compared to the three-year average of\neach member of the peer group to determine our\npercentile rank.\n\nOnce PNC's percentile rank relating to average\nEPS growth and PNC's average ROE are\ndetermined for purposes of the grants, the\ncorporate performance factor, ranging from\n0\u2013150%, will be calculated using the grid\nbelow and applying bilinear interpolation.\n\nThe chart below shows the corporate\nperformance metrics for the 2021 grants (the\ncorporate performance metrics for the 2020\ngrants were disclosed in our 2020 proxy\nstatement). For these grants, the Committee\napproved a range of ROE metrics, with the ROE\nperformance levels generally lower than the\nlevels in the 2020 grants (but consistent with\nthe levels in the 2018 grants). The Committee\napproved this new payout grid based on the\noverall economic environment, the lower\ninterest rate environment, PNC's desire to\nmaintain a moderate risk profile and the\nexpected ROE impact from the sale of our\nequity position in BlackRock. The Committee\ndid not reduce the highest performance level\nin the payout grid, however. As with the prior\ngrant, PNC still needs to achieve an average\nROE of 13.00% for our NEOs to be eligible to\nreceive the highest payout (150%) under the\n2021 PSU grants.\n                                              \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                    P\u2026  \n                     \u2026         P\u2026         p\u2026  \n                     \u2026         p\u2026         r\u2026  \n                     \u2026         r\u2026         (\u2026  \n                     \u2026         (\u2026         or  \n                     \u2026                    a\u2026  \n           \u2026         \u2026         1\u2026         1\u2026  \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n                                              \nWhen calculating our average ROE and EPS\ngrowth for this award, we will reverse the\nafter-tax impact of our provision for credit\nlosses \u2014 that is, we will add back the\nprovision amount to our reported net income.\nWe will then subtract total net charge-offs\nfrom the net income amount and adjust net\nincome for the change in taxes. Net charge-\noffs represent the amount of a loan (or\nportion of a loan) that we remove from our\nbalance sheet because we deem it to be\nuncollectible, less any recoveries. We expect\nthis adjusted ROE and EPS growth to present a\nmore accurate measurement of how efficiently\nwe create profit, as it replaces our estimated\ncredit losses (provision) with the actual\nlosses we incur (net charge-offs). Adjustments\nwill also be made on an after-tax basis for\nthe impact to PNC and the companies in our\npeer group, as appropriate, of items resulting\nfrom changes in federal tax law, discontinued\noperations (as such term is used under GAAP),\nacquisition costs and merger integration\ncosts, and the net impact to PNC of\nsignificant gains or losses related to\nBlackRock transactions.\n                                              \n  RSUs.                                       \n                                              \nWith respect to 2020 performance, in early\n2021 the Committee also granted to certain of\nour senior executives, including all NEOs,\nRSUs that represent an opportunity to receive\nshares of PNC common stock. The RSUs vest pro\nrata over three years, with each of the three\nannual installments (tranches) vesting on the\nanniversary of the grant date. Vesting also\nrequires the satisfaction of service\nrequirements and other award conditions.\n                                              \n  Additional provisions for PSUs and RSUs.    \n                                              \nThe provisions described in this section apply\nto each of our long-term incentive awards \u2014\nthe PSUs and the RSUs.\n\nRisk-based performance reviews. All long-term\nincentive awards are subject to risk-based\nperformance reviews. The risk-based\nperformance metric measures whether PNC has a\nBasel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio\nof at least 7.0% based on current definitions\nand requirements (\"CET1 Ratio\"). The CET1\nRatio is measured as of the end of the\nperformance year.\n\nFor PSUs, for each year during the three-year\nperformance period that PNC fails to meet the\nCET1 Ratio, one-third of the target number of\nPSUs granted will be eligible for forfeiture.\nAfter the three-year performance period ends,\nthe Committee will conduct a final performance\nreview and reduce the number of target shares\navailable for payout if PNC did not meet the\nCET1 Ratio for one or more years during the\nperformance period.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        45  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nFor RSUs, each RSU tranche is subject to the\nsame risk-related performance metric that will\nbe applied to the PSUs, with all or a portion\nof that tranche being eligible for forfeiture.\nAfter the year ends, the Committee will\nconduct a risk-based performance review and\ndecrease the number of shares available for\npayout under the applicable RSU tranche if PNC\ndid not meet the CET1 Ratio as of the end of\nthe most recent year before the vesting date\nof that tranche.\n\nIn addition, and independent from the\nevaluation of the CET1 Ratio, the Committee\nmay conduct another risk performance review\nfor the PSUs and the RSUs. This discretionary\nreview would generally occur in connection\nwith a risk-related action of potentially\nmaterial consequence to PNC. If the Committee\nexercises its discretion to conduct a risk\nperformance review, the Committee will review\nand determine if a reduction to the corporate\nperformance factor for risk performance is\nappropriate for the PSUs or if a reduction for\nrisk performance is appropriate for the\napplicable RSU tranche.\n\nDividends. Both the PSUs and the RSUs will\naccrue cash dividend equivalents during their\nrespective performance periods. For the PSUs,\nthe accrued dividend equivalents will be\nadjusted by the same percentage as the target\nPSUs at the time of payout and will then be\npaid out in cash. For the RSUs, the accrued\ndividend equivalents with respect to a tranche\nwill pay out in cash at the same time, and\nwill be adjusted by the same payout\npercentage, as the RSUs to which they relate.\n                                              \n  Other compensation and benefits             \n                                              \nIn addition to the components included in the\ntotal compensation target outlined above, our\nexecutive compensation program also includes\nthe following components:\n                                              \n                         \u2022Provided, in        \n                         limited              \n                         circumstances, to    \n                         increase efficiency  \n  Perquisites            and focus on our     \n                         business.            \n                         \u2022Described in more   \n                         detail beginning on  \n                         page 57.             \n                         \u2022Provided for        \n                         continuity of        \n  Change\u00a0in\u00a0Control\u00a0     management in        \n  Arrangements           connection with a    \n                         change in control.   \n                         \u2022Described in more   \n                         detail on page 74.   \n                         \u2022Provided to         \n  Health and             promote health and   \n  Retirement Plans       wellness and         \n                         post-retirement      \n                         financial security.  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Glossary of key performance metrics         \n                                              \nThe following chart defines some of the key\nperformance metrics evaluated by the Committee\nand explains why we use each metric.

The Committee increased this target\nbased on several factors, including Mr.\nDemchak's experience as CEO and PNC's\nsuccessful long-term financial and strategic\nperformance under his leadership. As part of\nthis increase, the Committee also increased\nthe percentage of pay delivered through\nequity, furthering the alignment of his\ncompensation with the objectives of our long-\nterm shareholders. For 2020, the Committee\nincreased the long-term equity-based incentive\ncomponent of Mr. Demchak's compensation to 65%\n(up from 60%) of his total compensation. For\nan additional discussion of the mix of cash\nand equity delivered to the NEOs based on 2020\nperformance, see page 50.\n\nAt the February 2020 meeting, the Committee\nalso increased the total compensation targets\nfor each of Ms. Larrimer and Mr. Reilly to\n$4,800,000. The Committee approved these\nincreases based on the scope of duties,\nperformance, skills and experience of each\nexecutive, as well as changes in market\ninformation for similar executives at other\nfinancial institutions.\n                                              \n  2020 performance                            \n                                              \nAt meetings held during the first quarter of\n2021, the Committee reviewed PNC's 2020\nperformance with the CEO, the Chief Risk\nOfficer and other members of management. In\nevaluating our 2020 performance, the Committee\nreviewed our performance against the range of\nmetrics described beginning on page 46,\nincluding the selected performance metrics\nidentified in the table below.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        47  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                       \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                       \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n      \u2026  %    \u2026  %    \u2026  %                    \n      \u2026  %    \u2026  %    \u2026  %                    \n      \u2026  %    \u2026  %    \u2026  %        \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026               \u2026                    \n         \u2026               \u2026                    \n         \u2026            \u2026  %                    \n      \u2026  %            \u2026  %                    \n                                              \n* Non-GAAP financial measure. See Annex A for\na reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP, and for additional\ninformation about the adjustments to GAAP\nmeasures.\n\n(1) These results include certain adjustments\nto PNC's performance and reflect our\ncontinuing operations following the\ndivestiture of our entire 22.4% equity\ninvestment in BlackRock, which occurred in the\nsecond quarter of 2020. As discussed in more\ndetail on page 45, we adjusted our 2020 and\n2019 results to add back our provision for\ncredit losses and subtract our net charge-\noffs. In addition, diluted EPS, ROE, ROA and\nrisk-adjusted efficiency ratio have been\nadjusted to reflect the impact of the\nBlackRock divestiture, which we report as\ndiscontinued operations. As a result of the\nadjustment for the BlackRock divestiture,\nthese metrics do not include the after-tax\ngain of $4.3 billion or BlackRock's historical\nresults. Based on these adjustments, the\nresults in the table may differ from reported\nresults under GAAP. See Annex A. When\nreviewing PNC's performance against peer\nperformance, we adjust peer performance for\nthe same types of items for which we could\nadjust PNC performance. In both 2019 and 2020,\nwe adjusted peer results for the impact of\nvarious merger-related and restructuring\ncharges and income (or loss) from discontinued\noperations.\n\n(2) As a smaller efficiency ratio is better\nthan a larger one, we have presented the\nincrease in the risk-adjusted efficiency ratio\nas a negative change when compared to our\nbudget, and the decrease in the risk-adjusted\nefficiency ratio as a positive change when\ncompared to the prior year's results.\n\nThe Committee considered PNC's overall\nperformance across these and other metrics,\nincluding how PNC's management navigated the\nglobal pandemic and resulting economic\nvolatility. In making compensation decisions\nfor the 2020 performance year, the Committee\nfocused on the following achievements:\n                                              \n  Consistently strong shareholder returns     \n  with                                        \n  one-year TSR the third-highest in the peer  \n  group                                       \n  and with three-year and five-year TSR       \n  above the                                   \n  75th percentile for the group               \n  An effective and comprehensive response to  \n  the                                         \n  global pandemic, with a focus on employee   \n  and                                         \n  customer safety, and serving our            \n  communities                                 \n  through loan modifications and the          \n  registration of                             \n  more than 70,000 PPP loans                  \n  Record revenue, positive operating          \n  leverage, a                                 \n  year-over-year decline in expenses and      \n  achievement                                 \n  of our $300 million continuous improvement  \n  program                                     \n  savings goal                                \n  The strategic sale of our equity position   \n  in                                          \n  BlackRock, which resulted in net proceeds   \n  of $14.2                                    \n  billion and an after-tax gain to PNC of     \n  $4.3                                        \n  billion                                     \n  Full-year net income of $7.6 billion,       \n  including                                   \n  the gain on the sale of our equity stake    \n  in                                          \n  BlackRock                                   \n  Income from continuing operations of $3.0   \n  billion,                                    \n  which excludes the proceeds from our sale   \n  of                                          \n  BlackRock and includes a substantial        \n  increase in                                 \n  our provision for credit losses             \n  Increasing tangible book value to $97.43    \n  per                                         \n  common share (from $83.30 at December 31,   \n  2019)                                       \n  Increasing our Basel III common equity      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capital ratio to 12.2%                      \n  The announcement of our plans to acquire    \n  BBVA USA,                                   \n  which, upon closing, would accelerate our   \n  national                                    \n  expansion strategy, establish a             \n  coast-to-coast                              \n  franchise for PNC and effectively redeploy  \n  the                                         \n  proceeds from the BlackRock sale            \n                                              \nIn addition, the Committee noted that despite\ntremendous volatility and uncertainty, PNC\nperformed close to its 2020 budget, exceeding\nexpectations for diluted EPS, noninterest\nincome and ROA, and underperforming slightly\nagainst net interest income, ROE and risk-\nadjusted efficiency ratio. The Committee\nfurther noted that while several of the 2020\nbudget numbers were lower than PNC's actual\nresults in 2019, the 2020 budget had been\nadjusted during the year to account for the\nsale of our BlackRock investment.\n                                              \n  48    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nThe Committee considered PNC's consistent\nability to deliver strong value to\nshareholders when compared to our peers, as\nshown by our TSR for 2020 as well as during\nthe past five years. The Committee compared\nother key financial metrics to our peer group,\nnoting that PNC was 4th in both net interest\nincome and risk-adjusted efficiency ratio and\nwas below the peer group median for\nnoninterest income, EPS growth, ROA and ROE.\nHowever, the sale of the equity stake in\nBlackRock, which resulted in both an infusion\nof excess capital and the elimination of\nincome from discontinued operations,\nnegatively affected ROA, ROE and EPS growth\nrelative to our peers.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed PNC's performance\nagainst the strategic priorities listed below,\nwhich had previously been reviewed with the\nBoard. The Committee concluded that management\ncontinued to drive growth across the franchise\nand make strategic investments to position PNC\nfor long-term success, including the following\nachievements:\n                                              \n  2020                                        \n  strategic                                   \n  priorities                                  \n                                Successfully  \n                                expanded our  \n                                middle        \n                                market        \n                                corporate     \n  Expanding                     banking       \n  our leading                   business      \n  banking                       into new      \n  franchise                     markets       \n  to new                        (Portland     \n  markets and                   and Seattle)  \n  digital                       and grew      \n  platforms                     revenue in    \n                                our           \n                                expansion     \n                                markets by    \n                                47% over      \n                                2019.         \n                 Continued                    \n                 our                          \n                 progress in                  \n                 the retail                   \n                 national                     \n                 expansion                    \n                 by                           \n                 introducing                  \n                 new digital                  \n                 products                     \n                 (Virtual                     \n                 Wallet                       \n                 Checking                     \n                 Pro) and                     \n                 opening 17                   \n                 new                          \n                 solutions                    \n                 centers in                   \n                 Boston,                      \n                 Dallas/Fort                  \n                 Worth,                       \n                 Houston and                  \n                 Nashville.                   \n                 Increased                    \n                 deposit                      \n                 transactio\u2026                  \n                 via ATM and                  \n                 mobile                       \n                 channels to                  \n                 64% of                       \n                 total                        \n                 deposit                      \n                 transactio\u2026                  \n                 (up from                     \n                 57% in                       \n                 2019).

The CEO\ndiscussed the individual performance of the\nNEOs with the Committee and, where\nappropriate, discussed the performance of the\nlines of business or functions managed by the\nNEOs. The Committee approved compensation for\neach NEO based on an evaluation of corporate,\nbusiness and individual performance. The\nCommittee discussed compensation\nrecommendations for the CEO with Meridian, the\nCommittee's independent compensation\nconsultant for 2020, our Chief Human Resources\nOfficer and our Head of Total Rewards. No\nother members of management were present.\nFollowing this discussion, the Committee\napproved the compensation for our CEO in an\nexecutive session.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the CEO\ncompensation decisions in an executive session\nof the independent members of the Board, with\nno members of management present. In that\nexecutive session, the Committee allowed time\nfor the independent directors to provide\ncomments or questions about the CEO's\nperformance or compensation.\n                                              \n  2020 compensation decisions                 \n                                              \nBased on a comprehensive evaluation of PNC's\n2020 performance, the Committee determined\nthat it was appropriate to award incentive\ncompensation that was above target for each\nNEO but generally below the aggregate\nincentive compensation awarded to the NEOs\nlast year. The key considerations for the\nCommittee's decisions included the effective\nperformance of the company through an\nunprecedented global pandemic, performance\nagainst absolute and relative metrics for\n2020, the strategic repositioning of the\ncompany through the sale of our equity\nposition in BlackRock and our proposed\nacquisition of BBVA USA, and the continued\nmaterial progress against PNC's three key\nstrategic priorities.\n\nThe Committee believed that paying incentive\ncompensation above the 2020 targets for each\nNEO rewarded the executives' effective\nmanagement during the pandemic, including\nthrough supporting the well-being and safety\nof our customers and employees, while still\ndelivering strong shareholder value and\nexecuting against our strategic priorities.\nThe Committee believed that as our CEO, Mr.\nDemchak did exceptionally well in managing PNC\nthrough a singularly challenging year and\nmaintaining organizational and executive focus\non the most significant issues facing PNC.\n\nIn recognition of this, the Committee awarded\nMr. Demchak incentive compensation of\napproximately 14% above target, and for each\nNEO other than the CEO, the Committee awarded\nincentive compensation of approximately 7%\nabove target. These incentive compensation\nawards reflected year-over-year decreases for\nMr. Demchak (down 8.1%), Mr. Lyons (down 6.0%)\nand Mr. Parsley (down 4.3%), with modest year-\nover-year increases for Ms. Larrimer and Mr.\nReilly\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        49  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \n(both up 2.3%). The incentive compensation\nawards were generally lower than last year's\namounts due largely to the impact of the\nglobal pandemic on our financial performance\nin 2020. For Ms. Larrimer and Mr. Reilly, the\nyear-over-year increases primarily reflected\nthe increases to their 2020 total compensation\ntargets as described in more detail on page\n47.\n\nFor 2020, the Committee also decided to\nincrease the percentage of deferred equity\npaid to each NEO, reducing the amount paid in\nimmediate cash. The Committee increased the\nratio of equity to total compensation for Mr.\nDemchak (from 65% to 75%), for Mr. Lyons and\nMr. Parsley (from 60% to 65% for each) and for\nMs. Larrimer and Mr. Reilly (from 50% to 55%\nfor each). The Committee believed that\nincreasing the portion of incentive\ncompensation paid in equity to each NEO would\nstrengthen the link to long-term performance\nin light of the strategic actions taken in\n2020 with the sale of our BlackRock investment\nand the planned acquisition of BBVA USA, and\nwould also maintain consistency with PNC's\noverall pay practices for 2020. The Committee\nexpects to revisit the appropriate mix of cash\nand equity each year.\n\nThe table below shows, for each NEO, the\nincentive compensation target for 2020 and the\nactual annual cash incentive and long-term\nincentives awarded for 2020 performance. The\nincentive compensation awarded for 2020\nperformance differs from what we disclose in\nthe Summary compensation table on page 62. In\ncompliance with SEC rules, the 2020 incentive\ncompensation disclosed in the Summary\ncompensation table includes incentive awards\nfrom two different performance years \u2014 the\nlong-term incentives granted in 2020 (for 2019\nperformance) and the annual cash incentive\npaid in 2021 (for 2020 performance).\n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                  \u2026           \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) Under SEC regulations, the incentive\ncompensation amounts disclosed in the Summary\ncompensation table on page 62 include the cash\nincentive award paid in 2021 for 2020\nperformance (the \"Non-Equity Incentive Plan\nCompensation\" column) and the long-term\nincentive award granted in 2020 for 2019\nperformance (the \"Stock Awards\" column). The\namounts shown in the \"Stock Awards\" column of\nthe Summary compensation table differ slightly\nfrom the amounts shown in the table above due\nto the impact of rounding related to\nfractional shares.\n\nAs described on pages 44 to 46, the long-term\nincentive portion of the incentive\ncompensation granted by the Committee in 2021\nconsisted of two grants, the PSUs and the\nRSUs.\n\nThe charts below show the base salary for 2020\nfor each executive, and the cash and long-term\nincentives awarded in 2021 for 2020\nperformance.

The PRSUs vest in four annual\ninstallments. At a meeting held on February\n10, 2021, the Committee determined the payout\nfor the 2020 tranche of the 2017 PRSU grant\nawarded to each NEO. The Committee approved a\nTSR-adjusted payout of 97.3% and certified\nthat the required risk-based capital ratio had\nbeen achieved.\n\nThe PRSU award provides that the payout may be\nreduced or eliminated if PNC's return on\neconomic capital (\"ROEC\") does not exceed the\ncost of capital (\"COC\") for a performance\nyear. If ROEC does not exceed COC, the\nCommittee must conduct a risk performance\nreview to determine whether to reduce or\neliminate the PRSU payout. For 2020, the ROEC\nwas 8.06% while the COC was 8.81%.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        53  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nThe Committee conducted a risk performance\nreview and concluded that two factors\ncontributed to the lower ROEC, but that\nneither factor stemmed from management taking\ninappropriate risks or poor risk performance.\nFirst, the strategic sale of our equity\nposition in BlackRock in May 2020 resulted in\na substantial infusion of equity during 2020.\nWhile substantially strengthening our balance\nsheet during an uncertain economic\nenvironment, this excess capital also reduces\nour returns (including ROEC) until it can be\nredeployed into other investments or\noperations. Second, unlike the LTI awards made\nbeginning in 2018, the PRSUs did not replace\nthe measure that estimates our credit losses\n(provision) with a measure that represents our\nactual credit losses (net charge-offs). This\nnegatively affected our ROEC in 2020 as our\nestimated credit losses increased\nsignificantly due to the global pandemic and\nrelated economic downturn. As neither of these\nfactors were determined to have resulted from\npoor risk management, the Committee did not\nbelieve that it was appropriate to decrease\nthe PRSU payout percentage. For more\ninformation about the rationale for\nsubstituting net charge-offs for provision,\nsee the discussion under Incentive\ncompensation program beginning on page 44.\n                                              \n  Current Program Awards                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  RSUs                                        \n                                              \n. The RSUs vest in annual installments over\nthree years. At a meeting held on February 10,\n2021, the Committee determined that the 2020\ntranche of each of the outstanding RSU grants\nawarded to the NEOs in 2018, 2019 and 2020 had\nvested 100% and that the risk performance\ncriteria had been satisfied.\n                                              \n  PSUs                                        \n                                              \n. The PSUs vest based on performance over a\nthree-year period. At a meeting held on\nFebruary 10, 2021, the Committee determined\nthat the PSU grants awarded to each NEO in\n2018 had vested and that the risk performance\ncriteria had been satisfied. The Committee\napproved a payout of 107.69% for the 2018\naward.\n\nUnder the terms of the award, the Committee\nreviews PNC's ROE and EPS growth for each year\nof the three-year performance period. We\nadjust these two metrics, as appropriate, for\ncertain items, including discontinued\noperations (under GAAP), acquisition costs and\nmerger integration costs, the net impact to\nPNC of significant gains or losses related to\nBlackRock transactions and changes in U.S.\nfederal tax law.\n\nOnce the performance period ends, we take the\naverage of each metric over the three-year\nperiod to determine an overall corporate\nperformance factor \u2014 we compare our average\nannual ROE to previously disclosed performance\ntargets and compare our average year-over-year\nEPS growth to our peer group, consistent with\nthe grid below:\n                                              \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                        \n                     \u2026                    P\u2026  \n                     \u2026         P\u2026         p\u2026  \n                     \u2026         p\u2026         r\u2026  \n                     \u2026         r\u2026         (\u2026  \n                     \u2026         (\u2026         or  \n                     \u2026                    a\u2026  \n           \u2026         \u2026         1\u2026         1\u2026  \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n      \u2026         \u2026         \u2026          \u2026        \n                                              \nThe Committee may also consider other unusual\nor nonrecurring adjustments in determining the\ncorporate performance factor and final payout\npercentage. In addition, the Committee may\nreduce or increase the payout under the award\nto maintain the intended economics of the\naward in light of changed circumstances \u2014\nmeaning external events affecting PNC, its\nfinancial statements or members of its peer\ngroup that are substantially outside of PNC's\ncontrol and could not reasonably be planned\nfor as of the grant date.\n\nFor the three-year performance period ended\nDecember 31, 2020, the adjusted metrics\nresulted in a corporate performance factor of\n79.99%. This factor was substantially affected\nby the sale of our 22.4% equity position in\nBlackRock in May 2020. The BlackRock sale,\nwhich resulted in net proceeds to PNC of $14.2\nbillion and an after-tax gain of $4.3 billion,\ncreated a significant amount of surplus\ncapital while removing a recurring source of\nincome, dramatically reducing both ROE and EPS\n(from continuing operations). In November\n2020, we announced plans to acquire BBVA USA,\nwhich upon closing is expected to redeploy the\nadditional excess BlackRock capital. With the\nBBVA USA acquisition not projected to close\nuntil 2021, however, the 2020 financial impact\nincluded a large temporary increase in capital\nwithout realizing any of the strategic\nbenefits from the redeployment of that\ncapital.\n\nBased on the successful sale of the BlackRock\ninvestment, which furthered our strategic\nobjectives, the Committee reviewed our ROE and\nEPS growth without considering the impact of\nBlackRock (treated under GAAP as discontinued\noperations). By removing the financial impact\nof our BlackRock equity investment for the\nentire performance period of the 2018 PSU\naward, the corporate performance factor for\nthe 2018 PSU award resulted in a 135.38%\npayout. These adjustments eliminated the net\nbook value of the BlackRock equity investment\nand any income derived from the investment\nover those years, and also eliminated the gain\non the sale of the equity.\n                                              \n  54    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nThe Committee then considered PNC's\nperformance over the three-year period, and\nthe benefits of divesting our passive\nBlackRock investment and strategically\nredeploying the capital through the proposed\nacquisition of BBVA USA, which benefits will\nnot be realized in the PSU metrics until after\nthe acquisition closes. Based on our overall\nperformance, including the unique\ncircumstances of the BlackRock transaction,\nthe Committee reduced the adjusted payout for\nthe 2018 PSU award to 107.69%, which averaged\nthe unadjusted and adjusted payout\npercentages, and recognized only a portion of\nthe adjusted results.\n\nThis payout represented the Committee's belief\nthat management should be rewarded for making\ndecisions to realize PNC's longer-term\nstrategic objectives, while also building up\ntemporary capital during an uncertain economic\nenvironment, but that the appropriate payout\nwas closer to target than 135.38%. The\nCommittee believes that the approved payout\nappropriately valued PNC's performance\nthroughout the performance period, while\nrewarding for some of the strategic benefits\nfrom the BlackRock sale in 2020.\n                                              \n  Compensation policies and practices         \n                                              \nThe Committee adopts policies and procedures\nto assist in the fulfillment of its duties,\nand we describe some of the significant\npolicies and procedures in this section.

The ownership\nrequirements increase the number of PNC shares\nthat an individual must own over time. As new\nawards vest, designated executives need to\nretain more shares of stock, which they must\nthen hold until they retire or leave PNC. This\nownership policy reflects compensation awards\nover an executive\u2019s career and ties an\nexecutive\u2019s personal wealth closely to the\nperformance of PNC and the interests of our\nlong-term shareholders.\n\nEquity interests that count toward\nsatisfaction of the ownership guidelines\ninclude shares owned outright by the officer,\nor his or her spouse and dependent children,\nrestricted shares (subject to time-vesting\nrequirements), certain equity awards and\nshares or stock units held in a benefit plan.\nFor awards granted during or after 2018, we do\nnot permit executives to count unvested\nperformance-based securities (i.e., the PSUs)\ntoward satisfaction of the guidelines.

The types of adverse\nimpacts could include matters such as impacts\nto PNC\u2019s or a business segment\u2019s or corporate\nfunction\u2019s financial performance, capital or\nliquidity positions, reputation or business\nprospects.\n\nThe negative adjustment resulting from risk-\nrelated actions allows PNC to recoup unvested\nequity awards from recipients whose\ninappropriate risk-taking activities have\nresulted in, or are expected to result in, a\nmaterial adverse impact to PNC in the future.\nBy doing so, we can further balance the risks\nin our incentive arrangements by accounting\nfor both forward- and backward-looking risk\nadjustments.\n\nThe policy provides that if PNC applies the\npolicy to recoup or clawback incentive\ncompensation or negatively adjust incentive\ncompensation as a result of risk-related\nactions and the underlying factual\ncircumstances are otherwise publicly reported\nby PNC in a filing with the SEC or in\ndisclosure that would otherwise meet the\nrequirements for public disclosure by PNC\nunder the SEC\u2019s Regulation FD, or are\ndisclosed by a third party in a publicly\navailable court or administrative filing, then\nPNC will disclose in its annual shareholder\nmeeting proxy statement, a current report on\nForm 8-K or other public filing made by it\nwith the SEC or a posting in a clearly\nidentifiable location in the Investor\nRelations section of its corporate website:\n\n\u2022 a general description of the circumstances\ngiving rise to the incentive compensation\nrecovery or adjustment, including items such\nas the number of employees, seniority of\nemployees and line of business impacted; and\n\n\u2022 the aggregate amount of incentive\ncompensation recovered or adjusted.\n\nPNC may limit such disclosure if it would be\nlikely to result in, or exacerbate, any\nexisting or threatened employee, shareholder\nor other litigation, arbitration or proceeding\nagainst PNC.\n                                              \n  Shareholder approval of severance           \n  agreements                                  \n                                              \nWe have a Board-approved policy regarding\nshareholder approval of future severance\narrangements. Under this policy, PNC will not\nenter into an arrangement with an executive\nofficer that provides for additional severance\nbenefits in an amount exceeding 2.99 times the\nsum of the executive officer\u2019s annual base\nsalary and target bonus for the year of\ntermination, unless the future severance\narrangement is approved by the affirmative\nvote of a majority of votes cast by\nshareholders on the matter.\n\nThe Board retains the right to amend,\nterminate or waive the policy and will\npromptly disclose any such change. We have\nmade this policy available at\nwww.pnc.com/corporategovernance .\n\nNone of our change of control agreements\ncontain any excise tax \u201cgross-up\u201d provisions.\nFor a more detailed discussion on change of\ncontrol agreements, see Change in Control and\nTermination of Employment\u2014Change of control\nagreements on page 74.\n                                              \n  Limiting perquisites                        \n                                              \nThe Committee believes in limiting the number\nand value of perquisites provided to our\nexecutives. We consider a benefit to be a\nperquisite or personal benefit unless its\npurpose is clearly and exclusively business-\nrelated. We determine the value of perquisites\nbased on their incremental cost to us.\n\nThe principal perquisites we may provide to\nour executive officers include financial\nconsulting and tax preparation services and\nlimited personal use of corporate aircraft, as\napproved by our CEO. The perquisites we\nprovide to our executive officers under the\nprogram do not include any tax \u201cgross ups.\u201d\nSome of our executive officers participate in\nbenefit programs or receive perquisites that\nwe no longer offer to current executives,\nincluding two NEOs who remain eligible to\nreceive executive physicals.\n\nIn addition to these perquisites, certain\nexecutives, including all NEOs (other than Mr.\nDemchak), receive a $10,000 allowance for\npersonal aircraft usage. As the Committee has\npreviously recommended that Mr. Demchak take\nall flights (personal or business) on the\ncorporate aircraft, the Committee has approved\nan allowance, not to exceed $100,000, for\npersonal flights taken on the aircraft by Mr.\nDemchak.\n\nThe Committee has previously approved the\nexecution of a lease (\u201ctime sharing\u201d)\nagreement between PNC and our CEO. Under the\nterms of the time sharing agreement, Mr.\nDemchak will pay for the costs of any personal\nflights that exceed the allowance described\nabove.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        57  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       \n                                              \nDue to certain operational restrictions and\nadministrative efficiencies, we operate our\ncorporate aircraft under Federal Aviation\nAdministration rules and regulations that\nlimit our ability to accept reimbursement for\npersonal aircraft usage unless an individual\nhas a time sharing agreement. The time sharing\nagreement provides a mechanism to obtain\nreimbursement from the executive. The costs\npaid by our CEO under the terms of the\nagreement include incremental costs, as well\nas a federal excise tax and other fees. For\nflights subject to the time sharing agreement,\nour CEO is required to pay us for the\nfollowing costs:\n\n\u2022 fuel, oil, lubricants and other additives;\n\n\u2022 travel expenses of crew, including food,\nlodging and ground transportation;\n\n\u2022 hangar and tie-down costs away from the\naircraft\u2019s base of operation;\n\n\u2022 insurance obtained for the specific flight;\n\n\u2022 landing fees, airport taxes and similar\nassessments;\n\n\u2022 custom, foreign permit and similar fees\ndirectly related to the flight;\n\n\u2022 in-flight food and beverages; and\n\n\u2022 passenger ground transportation.\n\nThe Committee has adopted an aviation policy\nand written procedures to document the\nprinciples to be applied in determining the\nclassification of a flight as business or\npersonal and the calculation of aggregate\nincremental cost for perquisite purposes,\nincluding definitions of personal use,\nenhanced methods for allocating costs between\nbusiness and personal use in complex\nsituations and an approach for capturing\ndeadhead flights, where appropriate, in the\ncalculation of incremental costs for personal\naircraft use.\n                                              \n  Guidelines on the use of discretion         \n                                              \nThe Committee has adopted guidelines on using\ndiscretion in incentive compensation plans.\nUnder these guidelines, the use of discretion\nwill be exercised, when permitted under a\nplan, so that incentive compensation awards\nare reasonably aligned with risk-adjusted\nperformance. Certain plans have discretionary\nand formulaic components, while other plans\nare fully discretionary. For plans with both\ndiscretionary and formulaic components, the\nguidance provides, among other things, that a\ndiscretionary increase in otherwise\nformulaically-determined incentive\ncompensation should be based on behaviors,\nactions or results that are deemed to be\nextraordinary, exceed expectations or provide\nmeaningful direct or indirect benefits to PNC\nor our businesses. At the same time,\ndiscretionary reductions in compensation\nshould be based on behaviors, actions or\nresults that fail to meet expectations or\nnegatively impact our performance, reputation\nor work environment. The guidelines\nspecifically address the need to evaluate both\ninappropriate risk-taking behaviors during the\nperformance year, as well as the outcome of\nprior inappropriate risk-taking behaviors,\nwhen making discretionary incentive\ncompensation decisions. In addition, managers\nare generally required to document how\ndiscretion was applied in considering risk-\ntaking behaviors and outcomes in employees\u2019\nperformance evaluations or incentive\ncompensation recommendations, particularly for\nour most senior executives.\n                                              \n  Restrictions on trading, hedging and        \n  pledging                                    \n                                              \nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and\nrelated policies, which apply to our employees\nand directors, include anti-hedging provisions\nthat prohibit all employees and directors from\nday trading or short selling PNC securities\nand from engaging in transactions in any\nderivative of PNC securities (other than\nsecurities issued under a PNC compensation\nplan), including buying and writing options.\n\nWe prohibit certain employees, including all\nexecutive officers, and our directors from\npurchasing or selling our securities beginning\nthe 16 th day of the last month of each\ncalendar quarter until the second business day\nafter we release our earnings for that\nquarter. We may also impose additional trading\nrestrictions on certain employees, including\nour executive officers, and our directors due\nto the availability of material non-public\ninformation regarding PNC or our securities.\nIn addition, we require certain employees,\nincluding all executive officers, to pre-clear\npersonal investments (other than in specified\ntypes of securities) made by the individual or\nany immediate family member.\n\nAdditionally, we do not allow directors,\nexecutive officers, and certain other senior\nemployees to pledge PNC securities. These\nrestrictions also generally apply to immediate\nfamily members of the covered employees and\ndirectors.\n                                              \n  Consideration of tax deductibility          \n                                              \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code\ndoes not generally allow a company to deduct\ncompensation over $1 million paid to certain\nexecutive officers. Although the Committee\nconsiders the deductibility of expenses when\nit makes compensation decisions, the Committee\nbelieves in maintaining the flexibility and\ncompetitive effectiveness of the executive\ncompensation program. The Committee retains\nthe discretion to establish the compensation\npaid to the NEOs as the Committee determines\nto be in the best interests of PNC and its\nshareholders, and without regard to any\nlimitation provided in Section 162(m).

With each of our\nemployees, we reinforce the importance of\nmanaging risks in executing on our strategic\nobjectives and in support of our desired risk\nappetite.\n\nWe approve our Enterprise Risk Management\nFramework and key risk policies at the Board\nlevel. We discuss our risk management approach\nin the Risk Management section of Item 7 of\nthis year\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe reflect our desired enterprise risk\nappetite by helping to ensure that our\nperformance management and compensation\narrangements for all employees are balanced in\nways that do not create incentives for\nimprudent or excessive risk-taking, are\ndesigned to provide a superior customer\nexperience and are reflective of our business\nmodel, management structure and risk appetite.\n\nOur compensation philosophy supports and\nreflects PNC\u2019s risk appetite and risk\nmanagement culture. Our risk policies and\nprocedures guide our management decisions,\nincluding how we pay employees. By setting and\ncommunicating our risk appetite in advance, we\nseek to manage and control the risks that\nemployees can take or influence, consistent\nwith their roles and responsibilities.\n\nAll employees have performance goals tied to\nbusiness and individual performance, but each\nemployee, no matter their role at PNC, also\nhas customer focus and risk management goals.\nWe evaluate employee performance against these\ngoals, in addition to considering risk\noutcomes from actions taken in prior years. We\nincorporate this comprehensive evaluation of\nemployee risk management into our performance\nand incentive compensation decisions. In\naddition, all employees are encouraged to\ncollaborate across groups to identify and\nmitigate risks and elevate and address\nidentified issues or concerns.\n\nOur compensation program is designed to\nencourage management of risk within our\nappetite and discourage inappropriate risk-\ntaking by granting a diverse portfolio of\nincentive compensation awards to our\nexecutives and other senior employees that is\nexpected to reward desired behavior over time.\nSpecifically, we balance our portfolio of\nawards between fixed and variable\ncompensation; cash and equity-based\ncompensation; and annual and long-term\ncompensation. We base awards on the\nCommittee\u2019s assessment of a variety of\nquantitative and qualitative performance\nmeasurements, both on an absolute and a\nrelative basis. Compensation decisions also\nrely on discretion to consider other factors,\nsuch as effective risk management, delivering\na superior customer experience, compliance\nwith controls and\n                                              \n  60    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION AND RISK                      \n                                              \nethical duties, commitment to diversity and\ninclusion, competition for top talent, market-\nbased pay levels and the need to attract and\nengage our leaders.\n\nAs discussed in the CD&A, the long-term\nincentive program includes grants to our NEOs\nand certain other executives that include a\nrisk-based performance metric. Payouts under\nthese grants could be forfeited if we do not\nmeet the CET1 Ratio described on page 45. We\nalso have a broad-based clawback and incentive\ncompensation adjustment policy as described\nbeginning on page 56.\n\nWe maintain an equity program for\napproximately 140 senior leaders below the\nexecutive levels that is designed to help\nensure that their incentive compensation\nawards reflect risk-adjusted performance\noutcomes that would pay out, if at all, over a\nthree-year period. These senior leaders\nreceive a portion of their incentive\ncompensation in an equity-based award that is\nsubject to the same risk-related performance\nmetric that will be applied to the PSU and RSU\ngrants made to NEOs and certain other\nexecutives. Additionally, the equity award\nagreements for these senior leaders all\ncontain an enterprise-wide risk-based review\ntrigger, while the agreements for senior\nleaders in business segments (as opposed to\nthose in administrative or control functions)\ncontain an additional, business-specific risk-\nbased review trigger. If a risk-based review\nis triggered, the applicable review committee\nwill determine whether a downward adjustment\nis warranted, up to a complete cancellation of\nthe share units in that year\u2019s tranche.\n                                              \n  Risk review of compensation plans           \n                                              \nOur Chief Risk Officer reports at least\nquarterly to the Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee to discuss risk management and\nreview the connection between effective risk\nmanagement and incentive compensation. The\nChief Risk Officer also presents the Committee\nwith a risk assessment for each of our\nprincipal business units and a collective\nassessment of staff functions, including\nfinance, human resources, legal, operations\nand technology. In addition, we maintain at\nleast one director who is a member of both the\nPersonnel and Compensation and Risk\nCommittees. At present, PNC's lead director,\nwho is a member of the Risk Committee, also\nserves on the Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee.\n\nWe also have systematically identified\nindividuals who could potentially expose us to\nmaterial amounts of risk or financial loss. As\nwith our incentive compensation risk\nassessment described below, we have\nestablished a cross-functional team that\ncontinues to identify and monitor these\nindividuals. These individuals are subject to\na supplemental risk management review as part\nof the performance management process by the\nChief Risk Officer and his designees \u2014 we take\nthis review into account when determining\nincentive compensation awards for our most\nsenior executives.\n\nWe have developed a standardized governance\nframework for our incentive compensation plans\nto help monitor and validate that our plans\nbalance risk and reward, comply with\napplicable laws and regulations, demonstrate\nfiscal responsibility and maintain an\nappropriate customer focus. T his framework\nhelps to ensure that we have the appropriate\nprocedures, controls and independent\nchallenges in place to do so. We continue to\nassess and, where appropriate, modify our\nincentive compensation plans in accordance\nwith this framework to help ensure our plans\nappropriately reflect risk considerations,\nincluding the management of identified issues,\nthe duration of the risks and alignment with\nour desired risk appetite. Examples of\nincentive plan modifications include:\n\n\u2022 Adding or increasing the visibility of risk\nand customer focus metrics to plans based on\nthe structure of the plan and the nature of\nthe business and the roles of participants\n\n\u2022 Adding or formalizing language around\ndelaying award payments or recapture or\nreduction of payments where subsequent risk\nmetrics indicate excessive risk-taking\n\n\u2022 Enhancing documentation of the plan design\nand use of discretion in non-formulaic plans\nat the pool funding, business allocation or\nindividual award level\n\nBased on our approach to risk management, our\ncomprehensive incentive plan governance\nframework, our risk assessments for\nsignificant businesses and staff functions,\nand the inclusion of risk-based metrics in our\nlong-term incentive compensation programs, we\nbelieve that the risks arising from our\ncompensation plans, policies and practices are\nnot reasonably likely to have a material\nadverse effect on PNC.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        61  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Summary compensation table                  \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                           $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n* Ms. Larrimer was not an NEO in 2018.\n\n(a) This column includes any salary amounts\ndeferred by an NEO under qualified (ISP) or\nnon-qualified (DCIP) benefit plans.

This column includes\nthe costs of financial consulting and tax\npreparation services for Mr. Demchak, Mr.\nReilly, Mr. Parsley and Ms. Larrimer, and\npersonal use of corporate aircraft by Mr.\nDemchak, Mr. Lyons and Mr. Parsley during\n2020. The incremental cost of Mr. Demchak\u2019s\nuse of the aircraft in 2020 was $99,452. Mr.\nDemchak used his time sharing agreement for\nflights in excess of this amount during 2020.\nThe incremental cost to PNC of personal\naircraft use is calculated by multiplying the\ntotal number of personal flight hours by the\naverage direct variable operating costs\n(including costs related to fuel, maintenance\nexpenses related to operation of the plane\nduring the year, and landing and parking fees)\nper flight hour for the particular aircraft\nfor the year, plus crew expenses attributable\nto the personal use. Since the aircraft are\nused primarily for business travel, we do not\ninclude in the calculation the fixed costs\nthat do not change based on usage, such as\ncrew salaries and other maintenance and\ninspection and capital improvement costs\nintended to cover a multiple-year period. The\nNEOs each have a corporate travel credit card\nnot generally available to all employees, for\nwhich there is no incremental cost to PNC.\n\n** We pay premiums for certain of the NEOs in\nconnection with our Key Executive Equity\nProgram, which is a split-dollar insurance\narrangement. In addition, we pay long-term\ndisability premiums on behalf of certain of\nour NEOs. New participants have not been\npermitted in either program since 2007. The\ndollar amounts under the \u201cInsurance Premiums\u201d\ncolumn include the 2020 premiums we paid in\nconnection with our Key Executive Equity\nProgram on behalf of Mr. Demchak ($40,534) and\nMr. Reilly ($16,732). These premiums represent\nthe full dollar amounts we paid for both the\nterm and non-term portions of this plan. The\namounts under this column also include the\nlong-term disability premiums we paid on\nbehalf of Mr. Demchak ($4,778) and Mr. Reilly\n($4,195).\n\n*** This column reflects the dollar amount of\nmatching gifts made by us to charitable\norganizations under our employee charitable\nmatching gift program for Ms. Larrimer\n($1,100).\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        63  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Grants of plan-based awards in fiscal 2020  \n                                              \n                                              \n      \u2026    \u2026           \u2026        \u2026             \n      \u2026    \u2026           \u2026        \u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2014    $      \u2014                      \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2014    $      \u2014                      \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2014    $      \u2014                      \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2014    $      \u2014                      \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2014    $      \u2014                      \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                         \u2026        $    \n      \u2026                                       \n                                              \n(a) The amounts listed in the \u201cTarget\u201d column\nrelate to the target annual cash incentive\naward for the 2020 performance year.

As there\nis no guaranteed minimum payout for these\nawards, and in the case of the PSUs, the\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee has\ndiscretion to decrease any award otherwise\npayable, we have not included a \u201cThreshold\u201d\namount.

The pension plan is a\ndefined benefit cash balance pension plan\nunder the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), and is\nintended to be qualified under Section 401(a)\nof the Internal Revenue Code. Each calendar\nquarter, eligible participants receive\n\u201cearnings credits\u201d based on a percentage of\neligible compensation. Earnings credit\npercentages for employees who were plan\nparticipants on December 31, 2009 are based on\na schedule using the participant\u2019s age and\nyears of credited service at that date and are\nfrozen at that level. Earnings credits for all\nemployees who become participants on or after\nJanuary 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible\ncompensation.\n\nThe plan defines eligible \u201ccompensation\u201d as\nregular earnings plus eligible variable\ncompensation, such as paid annual incentives.\nEligible \u201ccompensation\u201d does not include\ndeferrals under the terms of the non-qualified\ndeferred compensation and incentive plan;\nthese are instead taken into account under our\nexcess pension plan described below. We\ngenerally limit eligible variable compensation\nfor a plan year to a total of 100% of the\nfirst $25,000 plus 50% of the next $225,000.\n\nFor participants who had accrued benefits\nprior to 1999 under the pension plan formula\nthen in effect, an initial cash balance\n\u201caccount\u201d was established based on the present\nvalue of the accrued benefits at the time of\nthe conversion to the current program.\n\nPlan participants generally receive quarterly\n\u201cinterest credits\u201d at a rate of one-fourth of\nthe annual interest rate on 30-year Treasury\nsecurities. Employees who were already plan\nparticipants as of December 31, 2009 receive a\nminimum interest credit.\n\nAt the end of 2008, the cash balance pension\nplan previously sponsored by National City\nCorporation was merged into this plan.\nEarnings and interest credits for National\nCity participants are generally as noted\nabove.\n\nWe contribute to the plan an actuarially\ndetermined amount necessary to fund the total\nbenefits payable to participants. Actuaries\ncalculate total contributions instead of\ncontributions for each individual participant.\n                                              \n  Excess pension plan.                        \n                                              \nWe maintain an ERISA excess pension plan,\nwhich is a supplemental non-qualified pension\nplan. The excess benefits under this plan\nequal the difference, if any, between a\nparticipant\u2019s benefit under the qualified\npension plan computed without regard to\napplicable Internal Revenue Code limits and\ntaking into account amounts deferred under the\nnon-qualified deferred compensation and\nincentive plan, and the participant\u2019s actual\nbenefit under the qualified pension plan.\n                                              \n  Supplemental executive retirement plan.     \n                                              \nWe maintain a supplemental executive\nretirement plan for certain executive\nofficers. As part of its ongoing review of\ncompensation practices, the Personnel and\nCompensation Committee decided in 2007 to\neliminate future plan participation for new\nexecutive officers. This plan provides\nearnings credits based on a percentage of\nannual incentives awarded under eligible\nexecutive bonus plans in accordance with a\nschedule based on the participant\u2019s age and\nyears of credited service. This plan also\nprovides quarterly interest credits that\nmirror the interest credits under the\nqualified pension plan.\n\nExecutive officers who participated in the\nsupplemental executive retirement plan on\nDecember 31, 1998 and who were at least age 50\nwith five or more years of credited service\nreceive grandfathered benefits based on the\npension formula in effect prior to 1999. For\nexecutive officers at or above a certain\norganizational level who participated on\nDecember 31, 1998 but who did not meet the\nrequirements for grandfathered benefits, we\ndoubled the earnings credit percentages in\norder to mitigate the effect of the transition\nto the cash balance pension formula.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        69  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \n                                              \n                 Num\u2026          Pres\u2026          \n                   of          Value    Pay\u2026  \n                 Yea\u2026             of    Dur\u2026  \n                 Cre\u2026          Accu\u2026    Last  \n         Plan    Ser\u2026          Bene\u2026    Fis\u2026  \n  NEO    Name    (#)\u2026          ($)(\u2026    Year  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Wi\u2026    Qua\u2026                                 \n  S.

Credited service, where\napplicable, is generally equal to actual full\nyears of service; however, for purposes of\ndetermining the level of benefits earned in\nthe Qualified Pension Plan and ERISA Excess\nPension Plan, credited service has been frozen\nas of December 31, 2009. As of that date, the\nNEOs had the following years of credited\nservice: Mr. Demchak, 7; Mr. Reilly, 22; Mr.\nParsley, 6; and Ms. Larrimer, 14. Mr. Lyons\nwas hired after service accruals ceased to be\napplicable for purposes of calculating the\namount of Qualified Pension Plan and ERISA\nExcess Pension Plan benefits.\n\n(b) We compute the present values shown here\nas of December 31, 2020 in accordance with\nFASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation\u2014Retirement\nBenefits, as specified in applicable SEC\nregulations. The amounts do not necessarily\nreflect the amounts to which the NEOs would be\nentitled under the terms of these plans as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nWe calculate the present values for the plans\nby projecting the December 31, 2020 account\nbalances to an assumed retirement age of 65,\nusing an interest crediting rate of (i) 4.40%\nfor Mr. Demchak, Mr. Reilly, Mr. Parsley and\nMs. Larrimer, and (ii) 1.30% for Mr. Lyons,\nwho is not eligible for the guaranteed minimum\nannual interest crediting rate since he became\na plan participant after January 1, 2010. We\nthen apply a discount rate of 2.55% for the\nQualified Pension Plan and 2.10% for other\nplans to discount the balances back to\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nSee Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020\nfor additional information regarding the\ndiscount rates and other material assumptions.\n                                              \n  70    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   COMPENSATION TABLES                        \n                                              \nNon-qualified deferred compensation in fiscal\n2020\n\nWe offer an incentive savings plan (\"ISP\") in\nwhich most of our employees can participate\nafter they meet any applicable service\nrequirements, and for designated employees who\nexceed a compensation threshold, we also offer\na non-qualified deferred compensation and\nincentive plan (\"DCIP\"). Prior to establishing\nthe DCIP in 2012, we offered a non-qualified\nsupplemental incentive savings plan (\"SISP\"),\nwhich was a supplement to the ISP, and a non-\nqualified deferred compensation plan (\"DCP\"),\nin each case for certain designated employees\nwho exceeded applicable compensation\nthresholds.\n                                              \n  Incentive savings plan (ISP).               \n                                              \nThe ISP is a defined contribution 401(k) plan\nthat is intended to be qualified under Section\n401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. During\n2020, participants could elect to contribute\nbetween 1% and 75% of eligible compensation to\nthe plan each year as pre-tax or Roth after-\ntax elective deferrals (or a combination of\npre-tax and Roth after-tax elective\ndeferrals), subject to Internal Revenue Code\nlimits. Participants who are age 50 or older\nmay contribute additional pre-tax amounts\ncalled \u201ccatch-up contributions\u201d each year. For\n2020, we made employer matching contributions\non behalf of eligible participants equal to\n100% of elective deferrals up to 4% of\neligible compensation. Matching contributions\nwere made in cash. Participants direct the\ninvestment of their accounts among the\ninvestment options offered under the plan, and\ntheir account balances are adjusted for gains\nor losses resulting from those investment\ndirections.\n                                              \n  Deferred compensation and incentive plan    \n  (DCIP).                                     \n                                              \nWe maintain a DCIP for designated employees\nwho exceed a compensation threshold.\nParticipants can elect to defer up to 20% of\nbase salary and/or up to 75% of eligible\nshort-term incentive pay earned with respect\nto a plan year. The DCIP\u2019s plan year is the\ncalendar year.

Effective\nJanuary 1, 2012, the SISP and DCP were frozen\nto new participants and to the deferral of\namounts earned on and after January 1, 2012.\nDistributions from these plans are paid in\ncash in accordance with the participant\u2019s\nelection. Participants with existing account\nbalances can direct the investment of their\naccounts among the hypothetical investment\nalternatives made available under the plan,\nand their accounts are adjusted for deemed\ninvestment gains or losses resulting from such\ninvestment directions.\n                                              \n  Investment options.                         \n                                              \nISP, DCIP, SISP and DCP participants have the\ninvestment options listed on page 73.

These benefits\nresult from:\n\n\u2022 change of control agreements,\n\n\u2022 the terms of our equity-based grants, and\n\n\u2022 other existing plans and arrangements in\nwhich our NEOs participate.\n\nWe do not have a separate severance plan or\nprogram for the NEOs. The Personnel and\nCompensation Committee has discretion to\nprovide severance benefits subject to the\nparameters of our Board-approved policy, as\ndescribed in the CD&A on page 57.\n\nThe benefits an executive may receive will\ndepend on whether PNC or the executive\nterminated employment and, if PNC terminated\nemployment, whether the termination was for\ncause, resulted from death or disability, or\nfollowed a change in control, and whether the\nexecutive is retirement-eligible. If a\nretirement-eligible employee resigns or is\nterminated without cause, we consider it a\nretirement. For these purposes, a \u201cretirement-\neligible\u201d employee is someone who is at least\n55 years old and has at least five years of\nservice with PNC. As of December 31, 2020,\nfour of our NEOs were retirement-eligible.\n                                              \n  Change of control agreements                \n                                              \nAs of December 31, 2020, we have entered into\nseparate change of control agreements with\neach of our NEOs and similar agreements with a\nlimited group of other senior officers. These\nagreements have been a valuable component of\nour executive compensation program for several\nyears. We believe these arrangements mitigate\nconcerns arising from a change of control, and\nhelp to ensure the continued dedicated service\nof our key employees. Cash payments\ncontemplated by these agreements require a\n\u201cdouble trigger\u201d \u2014 that is, the occurrence of\nboth a change of control and a qualifying\ntermination of employment. A qualifying\ntermination would occur if the executive\nresigned for \u201cGood Reason\u201d or the surviving\ncompany terminated the executive other than\nfor \u201cCause,\u201d \u201cDisability\u201d or death (each as\ndefined in the change of control agreement).\nThe treatment of equity awards upon a change\nof control is addressed in the equity award\nagreements themselves, as described below,\nrather than the change of control agreements.\n\nThe change of control agreements provide for\ncash payments to our NEOs calculated based on\nvarious compensation components, including\nannual base salary and an annual incentive\naward (bonus). For purposes of the change of\ncontrol agreements, annual base salary is\nequal to 12 times the highest monthly base\nsalary rate payable to the executive in the\n12-month period preceding the month of the\nchange of control. The cash payment related to\nbase salary is equal to two times the annual\nbase salary, and the cash payment related to\nbonus is equal to two times the applicable\nbonus percentage multiplied by annual base\nsalary. The agreements also provide for\ncontinued benefits under (or compute cash\npayments by reference to) certain of our\nretirement and health and welfare benefit\nplans.\n\nNone of our change of control agreements\ncontain any excise tax \u201cgross-up\u201d provisions.\nOur current change of control agreements\nprovide that in the event the benefits payable\nto an executive trigger excise taxes under\nSection 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the\nexecutive will be entitled to a reduction in\nbenefits so that no excise tax is imposed if\nsuch a reduction would result in a greater net\n(after-tax) benefit to the executive than\npayment of the full amount of his or her\nbenefits. We have a Board-approved policy that\nrequires shareholder approval of certain\nfuture severance arrangements if the\narrangement provides for additional severance\nbenefits in an amount exceeding 2.99 times the\nsum of the executive\u2019s annual base salary and\ntarget bonus.\n\nThe change of control agreements prohibit the\nexecutives from employing or soliciting any of\nour officers during the one-year period\nfollowing termination, and from using or\ndisclosing any of our confidential business or\ntechnical information or trade secrets.\n\nWhile the benefits to be received under a\nchange of control agreement may be significant\nto an individual, they first require the\noccurrence of a significant transaction. As a\nresult, the benefits are highly speculative\nand are contingent on a variety of facts and\ncircumstances. In recognition of this, the\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee of the\nBoard does not consider the amount of\npotential change in control payments when it\nmakes annual compensation decisions for our\nNEOs. Change in control protections, although\nmeaningful, also become relatively less\nsignificant to PNC as we increase in size.\n                                              \n  74    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   CHANGE IN CONTROL AND TERMINATION OF       \n   EMPLOYMENT                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Equity-based grants                         \n                                              \nIf an NEO resigns or the NEO\u2019s employment is\nterminated with or without cause, any unvested\nequity-based compensation is generally\nforfeited. However, if an NEO retires (i.e., a\nretirement-eligible NEO resigns or is\nterminated without cause), equity-based\ncompensation is not forfeited and continues in\neffect until its originally scheduled payment\ndate. Equity-based compensation is also not\nforfeited under certain circumstances\nfollowing a change in control. Grants to our\nexecutive officers contain a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d\nfeature, meaning such grants require the\noccurrence of both a change in control and a\nqualifying termination (which includes a\ntermination without cause or a resignation for\ngood reason) in order to vest prior to the\noriginal vesting date in connection with a\nchange in control.\n\nA change in control of PNC, retirement of an\nNEO or termination of an NEO\u2019s employment by\nPNC by reason of disability has the following\nimpact on unvested equity-based compensation:\n                                              \n   RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  Change in       Retirement      Disability  \n  Control                                     \n  Following a                                 \n  change in                                   \n  control,                                    \n  outstanding                                 \n  RSUs will                                   \n  vest upon a                                 \n  qualifying                                  \n  termination                                 \n  or continued                                \n  employment                                  \n  through the                                 \n  original                                    \n  vesting                                     \n  date, and                                   \n  will be paid                                \n  as soon as                                  \n  practicable     RSUs                        \n  following       continue in                 \n  the original    effect in                   \n  vesting         accordance                  \n  date.

In addition, Mr. Demchak, Mr.\nReilly, Mr. Parsley and Ms. Larrimer\nparticipate in our SISP, and Mr. Demchak and\nMr. Reilly participate in our DCP (although\nthey may no longer make contributions to these\nplans). The NEOs earn these benefits for\nservices provided to us while employed, and\nmany of these plans are also available on a\nbroader basis to other employees. For the most\npart, an NEO\u2019s entitlement to these benefits\ndoes not depend on how employment is\nterminated.\n\nMr. Demchak and Mr. Reilly also participate in\nour supplemental executive retirement plan, a\ncompany-paid executive long-term disability\n(\"LTD\") program, and the Key Executive Equity\nProgram (\"KEEP\"), a split-dollar life\ninsurance program. Participants in the\nexecutive LTD program are generally eligible\nfor additional LTD benefits of $10,000 per\nmonth until they are no longer disabled or\nhave reached age 65. KEEP provides benefits in\nthe event of a participating executive\u2019s death\nwhile actively employed (equal to 1.5 times\nthen-current annual base salary) or following\nan eligible retirement (retirement after\nreaching age 55 and five years of service with\nPNC, generally equal to annual base salary\nprior to retirement). Following a change in\ncontrol, the life insurance policy would\ntransfer to the participating executive. The\nsupplemental executive retirement plan,\nexecutive LTD program and KEEP were frozen to\nnew participants as of December 31, 2007.\n\nCertain NEOs are also eligible to receive two\nyears of company-paid financial planning and\ntax preparation services upon retirement.\n                                              \n  Estimated benefits upon termination         \n                                              \nThe following table shows the estimated\nincremental benefits payable to our NEOs as of\nDecember 31, 2020 as a result of termination\nof employment in a variety of situations.\nThese estimated amounts have been calculated\nas if employment was terminated on December\n31, 2020. For change in control benefits, we\nassumed a change in control of PNC and a\ntermination of employment by the surviving\ncompany without cause (or a resignation of the\nofficer for good reason) on that date. To the\nextent relevant, the amounts assume a PNC\nstock price of $149.00, the closing price of\nour common stock on December 31, 2020. If we\ncalculated these amounts using a different\nprice, the amounts could be significantly\ndifferent. The benefits below do not include\nthe balances under our qualified cash balance\npension plan, ERISA excess pension plan,\nsupplemental executive retirement plan, SISP,\nISP, DCIP or DCP unless the NEO receives an\nenhanced benefit under the termination\nscenario. In addition, stock options are not\nincluded as there were no stock options\noutstanding for the NEOs as of December 31,\n2020.\n                                              \n

Demchak, our\nChairman, President and CEO, and the annual\ntotal compensation of our median employee\n(other than Mr. Demchak).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of Mr. Demchak\nwas $15,900,479\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of our median\nemployee was $80,350 (see below for an\nexplanation of how we calculate this amount)\n\n\u2022 The resulting ratio of Mr. Demchak's annual\ntotal compensation to the annual total\ncompensation of our median employee is 198 to\n1\n\nWe believe our ratio represents a reasonable\nestimate, calculated in a manner consistent\nwith SEC rules, based on the following\nmethodology:\n\n\u2022 As permitted under SEC rules, we are using\nthe same median employee for our 2020 pay\nratio calculation as was used for the 2019 and\n2018 pay ratio calculations in light of the\nfact that there has been no change in our\nemployee population or employee compensation\narrangements that we believe would\nsignificantly impact the pay ratio disclosure\n\n\u2022 To identify the median employee, we used the\nForm W-2 (Box 5) issued by the IRS for federal\ntax purposes as the compensation measure and\nevaluated the compensation for 52,885 active\nU.S. employees as of December 31, 2018 (this\npopulation excluded Mr. Demchak and all of our\n126 non-U.S. employees). 1 We did not\nannualize the compensation of any employee who\nwas employed by us for part of the year\n\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2020, we had 51,233\nactive U.S. employees (this population\nexcluded Mr. Demchak and all of our 124\nnon-U.S. employees) 2\n\n\u2022 We calculated the 2020 annual total\ncompensation for the median employee 3\n1 For 2018, we excluded 78 employees in the\nUK, 33 employees in Canada and 15 employees in\nGermany, representing less than 1% of our\ntotal employee population.\n\n2 As of December 31, 2020, we had 76 employees\nin the UK, 34 employees in Canada and 14\nemployees in Germany, representing less that\n1% of our total employee population.\n\n3 We calculated the annual total compensation\nfor the median employee in accordance with SEC\nrules, using the same methodology used to\ncalculate Mr. Demchak\u2019s total compensation in\nthe Summary compensation table, and we also\nincluded PNC\u2019s health care premium\ncontributions for both the median employee and\nMr. Demchak. As a result, Mr. Demchak\u2019s annual\ntotal compensation for pay ratio purposes is\nslightly higher than the amount reported for\nhim in the Summary compensation table on page\n62.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        79  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND       \n   CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS                  \n                                              \nSecurity ownership of directors and executive\nofficers\n\nThe table below sets forth information\nregarding ownership of our common stock by our\ndirectors and executive officers.

In\nconnection with this responsibility, the\nCommittee evaluates, monitors and reports to\nthe Board regarding the independence,\nqualifications and performance of the\nindependent auditors, including an evaluation\nof the lead audit partner. The Committee\napproves all audit engagement fees and terms\nassociated with the retention of the\nindependent auditors. The Audit Committee\ncharter requires the Committee to consider,\nnot less frequently than when the lead audit\npartner is rotated, whether PNC should adopt a\npolicy of regular rotation of the independent\naudit firm. In addition to assuring the\nrequired rotation of the lead audit partner,\nthe Committee oversees the selection of the\nnew lead audit partner and the Chair of the\nCommittee participates directly in the\nselection of the new lead audit partner.\n\nThe Audit Committee has selected\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\"PwC\") as our\nindependent auditors for 2021. PwC has been\nour independent auditors since 2007. In making\nthis selection, the Committee considered\nwhether there should be a rotation of the\nindependent audit firm. It also carefully\nconsidered, among other things, PwC's\nqualifications and performance, the quality\nand candor of its communications with the\nCommittee and PNC, and its independence,\nobjectivity and professional skepticism. On\nFebruary 11, 2021, the Committee presented its\nconclusions regarding the selection and\nappointment of PwC as our independent auditors\nto the Board, including a determination that\nthe selection of PwC as our independent\nauditors is in the best interest of PNC.\nFollowing this presentation, the Board voted\nunanimously to recommend that shareholders\nvote to ratify the Committee\u2019s selection of\nPwC as our independent registered public\naccounting firm for 2021. The Committee and\nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof PwC as our independent auditors is in the\nbest interest of PNC.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Board have adopted\na policy that if the ratification of the\nindependent auditors does not receive a\nmajority of the votes cast at the annual\nmeeting, the Committee will reconsider its\nselection of independent auditors. However,\nthe Committee will be under no obligation to\nselect new independent auditors. If the\nCommittee does select new independent auditors\nfor 2021, we will not seek shareholder\nratification of the new selection.\n\nWe expect representatives of PwC to be\navailable during the annual meeting. They will\nhave an opportunity to make a statement and\nrespond to appropriate questions.

The Committee\nmay either pre-approve specific fees or a\nmethodology for determining fees. Any proposed\nincrease in fees that exceeds the pre-approved\namounts requires the Committee\u2019s approval.\n\nPre-approval may be general (categories of\nservices) or specific (individual services).\nIf the Audit Committee pre-approves a general\ncategory of services, it will review the scope\nof services related to such general pre-\napproval at least annually. The Committee is\nresponsible for approving any fee or other\ncompensation arrangements for services covered\nby a pre-approval of a general category of\nservices.\n\nThe full Audit Committee may exercise pre-\napproval authority, or the Chair of the\nCommittee may exercise the authority as\nrequired between meetings. The Committee may\nalso delegate this authority, in whole or in\npart, to one or more Committee members. Any\nperson exercising delegated authority reports\non the pre-approvals at the next scheduled\nmeeting of the Committee, which will be\nreflected in the meeting minutes.\n\nThe Committee may not delegate its pre-\napproval authority to any other person,\nincluding any member of management or other\nPNC employee or agent.\n\nThe written request for pre-approval includes,\nat a minimum, a description of the nature of\nthe engagement, the proposed fee for the\nservices and a statement that the services to\nbe performed by the independent auditor are\nconsistent with SEC and other applicable rules\non auditor independence. In addition, each\npre-approval request is reviewed by the\nindependent auditor to confirm the provision\nof services is consistent with SEC and other\napplicable auditor independence rules. All\nrequests for pre-approval of services are\nreviewed by management to ensure the services\nare permitted under SEC regulations and the\nAudit Committee charter and include a\nrecommendation of the proposal by the Chief\nFinancial Officer or the Controller and the\nGeneral Auditor. In reviewing a pre-approval\nrequest, the Committee or the Chair of the\nCommittee may request that members of\nmanagement provide their views on auditor\nindependence questions.\n\nThe Controller or a designee of the Controller\nreports to the Audit Committee at least\nquarterly as to the status of services that\nhave been pre-approved and the related fees.\n\nThe Committee may amend these procedures from\ntime to time.\n\nAll audit services, audit-related services and\npermitted non-audit services and related fees\ndisclosed above were pre-approved by the Audit\nCommittee.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        83  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE              \n                                              \nThe Audit Committee\u2019s job is one of oversight,\nas set forth in its charter.

The\nindependent auditors are responsible for the\naudit of PNC\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and the audit of the effectiveness\nof PNC\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting.\n\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed\nPNC\u2019s audited consolidated financial\nstatements with management and with\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\"PwC\"), PNC\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor 2020.

After our shareholders voted in 2017,\nthe Board affirmed that recommendation and\nelected to hold future \u201csay-on-pay\u201d advisory\nvotes on an annual basis, until the next\nshareholder vote on \u201csay-on-pay\u201d frequency. We\nexpect to conduct the next shareholder vote on\n\u201csay-on-pay\u201d frequency at our 2023 annual\nmeeting of shareholders.\n\nWith this item, shareholders may submit an\nadvisory vote on the compensation of our CEO\nand the other four executive officers named in\nthe Summary compensation table on page 62. The\nSummary compensation table provides an annual\nsnapshot of the compensation paid or granted\nto our NEOs.\nWhat does it mean to have a \u201csay-on-pay\u201d\nadvisory vote?\nAs an advisory vote, the outcome will not bind\nPNC or the Board. We will disclose how many\nshareholders voted \u201cFor\u201d or \u201cAgainst\u201d the\nresolution and how many shareholders abstained\nfrom voting.\n\nWe believe in soliciting input from our\nshareholders throughout the year on a variety\nof issues, and this advisory vote fits within\nour broader shareholder engagement efforts. We\nhave averaged over 96% support in say-on-pay\nvotes over the past five years.\n\nWhile this vote is non-binding, the Board\nvalues the opinions of shareholders and will\ncarefully consider the results when making\nfuture compensation decisions. In considering\nan overall executive compensation program,\n\u201csay-on-pay\u201d cannot convey a shareholder\u2019s\nview on a discrete element of our compensation\nprogram or a specific decision made by the\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee.

This requires carrying out human\nrights due diligence, covering adverse impacts\nthat PNC may cause, contribute to, or be\ndirectly linked to through its operations,\nproducts, services, or business relationships.\n4 This applied regardless of the size or scope\nof those activities.\n\nPNC lends over $1.6 billion to nuclear weapons\ncompanies, including General Dynamics and\nothers. 5 Geopolitical uncertainty and erosion\nof several arms control treaties leaves the\nworld at its highest ever vulnerability to a\nnuclear weapons catastrophe. 6 Nuclear weapons\nare weapons of mass destruction,\nindiscriminate by nature, and illegal under\ninternational law. 7 Nuclear weapon impacts\ncannot be contained within national borders.\nThey cause massive death and destruction,\nlarge-scale displacement, long-term harm to\nhuman health and well-being, the environment,\ninfrastructure, socioeconomic development, and\nsocial order. 8\n\nAmidst growing societal pressure for nuclear\ndisarmament and heightened scrutiny of lending\npractices, PNC faces significant legal,\nfinancial, and reputational risks if it\ncontinues to be linked to the nuclear weapons\nindustry. The Treaty on the Prohibition of\nNuclear Weapons will enter into force in\nJanuary 2021, outlawing nuclear weapons use,\ndevelopment, or testing. 9 Investor screens\nfor nuclear weapons companies are increasing,\nwith over 75 major financial institutions\nadopting policies to end relationships with\nthe nuclear weapons industry. 10\n\nThe \"Stop Banking the Bomb Campaign\" has held\nover 75 demonstrations outside of PNC offices,\nincluding during PNC's shareholder meetings,\ncalling for divestment from nuclear weapons\nmanufacturers. 11\n\nThe extent of PNC's human rights due diligence\naround nuclear financing is not evident. The\ncompany's Environmental Social Risk Management\nFramework and rapid risk screening do not\nexplicitly address risks of financing any\ncontroversial weapons and do not identify the\ndefense sector as presenting elevated risk.\nRisk assessments should address the severity\nand likelihood of harm to potential\nstakeholders. 12 In response to public\npressure, PNC revaluated its financing of\nprivate prisons and mountaintop removal\nmining. 13 Despite the severe human rights\nrisk and business risks from nuclear weapons\nfinancing, PNC has failed to take similar\naction.\n4 https://www.ihrb.org/uploads/submissions/Joh\nn_Ruggie_Comments_Thun_Banks_Feb_2017.pdf\n\n5 https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com\n(Forthcoming Report)\n\n6 https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-\nclock/current-time/\n\n7 https://www.un.org/laws/icjsum/9623.htm;\nhttps://www.icanw.org/catastrophic_harm\n\n8\nhttps://www.icrc.org/en/document/humanitarian-\nimpacts-and-risks-use-nuclear-weapons\n\n9 https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/25/world/ame\nricas/nuclear-weapons-prohibition-treaty.html\n\n10 https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/201910_Beyond-the-\nbomb_final.pdf\n\n11 https://www.nuclearban.us/stop-banking-the-\nbomb-the-campaign-to-get-pnc-bank-to-divest-\nfrom-nuclear-weapons/; https://newpeoplenewspa\nper.com/2020/07/31/stop-banking-the-bomb-\nresumes-pickets-at-pnc/\n\n12 https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publication\ns/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf\n\n13 https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/corporate-\nresponsibility/corporate-social-\nresponsibility/governance-risk/values-\nbusiness.html;\nhttps://www.pnc.com/content/dam/pnc-\ncom/pdf/aboutpnc/CSR/PNC_2019_CSR_Report.pdf\n                                              \n  86    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REPORT ON RISK\n                                    MANAGEMENT\n                                              \n  AND THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS INDUSTRY (ITEM 4)   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Board of Directors Response                 \n                                              \nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote\nAGAINST this shareholder proposal because:\n\n\u2022 The Board recently reviewed our lending\nrelationships with companies connected to the\nnuclear defense industry, and the potential\nrisks these relationships present. The Board\nconcluded that these relationships do not pose\na material credit, legal or reputational risk\nto PNC and are consistent with our\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management\n(\"ESRM\") framework.\n\n\u2022 The companies the shareholder proponents\nhave characterized as \"nuclear weapons\ncompanies\" are in fact large and diversified\ncompanies that provide a myriad of products\nand services that benefit society and enhance\nthe quality of human life. The vast majority\nof these companies' operations and revenue\nbear no relationship to nuclear weapons.\n\n\u2022 Our exposure to these companies is small \u2014\nthey represent less than 0.3% of our total\nloan portfolio at December 31, 2020; our\nlending represents approximately 2% of these\ncompanies' capital structures; and an\nindependent third party ranked PNC 89th among\nfinancial organizations in its exposure to\nthese types of companies, while the\ninstitutions ranked ahead of PNC have in\naggregate over 700 times more exposure.\n\n\u2022 Our lending decisions are subject to our\nESRM framework, the loans at issue are subject\nto an environmental and human rights risk\nassessment, and the Board is regularly updated\non the ESRM framework. We have consistently\nfound no environmental, social and governance\n(\"ESG\") risks that would inherently exclude\nthese loan recipients from the application of\nour fair and consistent lending guidelines.\n\nIn contrast to the co-filers' classification\nof the companies in question as \"nuclear\nweapons companies,\" nuclear defense represents\na small portion of their operations. Products\nand services provided by these companies\ninclude the manufacture of cybersecurity and\ninformation technology solutions; construction\nmanagement and critical infrastructure\ndevelopment; navigation and radar systems;\nenvironmental remediation and revitalization;\nsafe drinking water management; wastewater\ntreatment; medical isotopes, which are used in\ncancer detection and treatment; and commercial\naircraft, golf carts, snowmobiles, and\nhealthcare technology, among others. Even if\nthe United States were a signatory to the\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,\nan international agreement referenced by the\nco-filers, we would expect to see little to no\nimpact on these companies' credit profiles.\nCollectively, these companies employ over\n750,000 people.\n\nMoreover, our exposure to these companies is\nsmall, representing approximately 0.3% of our\ntotal loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. We\nrepresent a very small portion of these\ncompanies' capital structures (less than 3%).\nA report produced by PAX, in conjunction with\nthe International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear\nWeapons, ranks PNC 89th among financial\norganizations in terms of total exposure to\nthe types of companies at issue, and the\ninstitutions ahead of PNC have in aggregate\nover 700 times more exposure.\n\nWe apply a multi-layered ESRM process to all\ncorporate lending, which includes a Rapid Risk\nScreen that subjects every Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking transaction to a\nbaseline environmental and human rights risk\nassessment. This assessment is industry-\nagnostic and is applied to every transaction \u2014\nno matter the size. It is designed to be\nmodular, so that as our business changes, we\ncan quickly develop and communicate\nenhancements to the tool. Such changes could\noccur when we enter new markets or new\nindustries, or as the external risk landscape\nshifts, to ensure our practices continue to\ntake into consideration pertinent risks,\nincluding emergent risks. Transactions\nidentified by the screening are escalated to\nleaders in the business and underwriting\ngroups, who determine whether to pass on the\ntransaction, do enhanced due diligence\nalongside our ESG team or proceed as\nrequested.\n\nWe strive to make lending decisions that\nbalance the needs of our customers and\nprospective customers with the interests of\nour other stakeholders, including investors,\ncommunity organizations and employees. We\nrecognize that these decisions must also take\ninto account evolving environmental, social\nand cultural concerns. Our ESRM framework \u2014\ninformation about which is published in our\nannual Corporate Social Responsibility Report\n\u2014 strives to capture these nuances by\nembedding a deep commitment to stakeholder\nengagement in the risk management process. In\nkeeping with this philosophy, we have met with\nthe group of activists associated with the co-\nfilers on this issue five times in the last\nthree years, and have provided them with a\nformal presentation of the ESRM process. We\nalso provided this overview to the co-filers\ndirectly.\n\nIn February 2021, the Board undertook a\nspecial and enhanced review of our lending\nrelationships with companies connected to the\nnuclear defense industry. This covered, among\nother things, the credit, legal and\nreputational risks potentially inherent to\nthese particular lending relationships.\nFollowing this review, the Board concluded\nthat our relationships with these companies do\nnot pose a material credit, legal or\nreputational risk to PNC.\n                                              \n  THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,           \n  INC. -2021 Proxy                        87  \n  Statement                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REPORT ON RISK\nMANAGEMENT\n                                              \n  AND THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS INDUSTRY (ITEM 4)   \n                                              \nAs a result, while we remain committed to\nengaging on this and other topics important to\nour stakeholders, the Board has determined:\n\n\u2022 We do not have a material impact on the\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons;\n\n\u2022 The companies in question have been\nthoroughly and appropriately vetted by our\nESRM process; and\n\n\u2022 Our ESRM systems effectively manage the\nrisks associated with our loans to these\ncompanies.\n                                              \n  88    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   GENERAL INFORMATION                        \n                                              \nWe will hold our annual meeting of\nshareholders on Tuesday, April 27, 2021.

A \u201cquorum\u201d refers to the\nminimum number of shares that must be present\nat the meeting. To have a quorum for the\nannual meeting, we need the presence of PNC\nshareholders or their proxies who are entitled\nto cast at least a majority of the votes that\nall shareholders are entitled to cast.\n\nIn determining if a quorum exists, we count\nthe number of shares represented by\nshareholders in person at the annual meeting\nand the number of shares represented by\nproxies.

Different proposals may have different\nvoting requirements for approval. This section\nprovides information regarding the vote\nrequired for approval of each proposal\npresented in the proxy statement and\nadditional details regarding the mechanics of\nproposal approval.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania law, if you abstain from\nvoting or fail to vote, your shares will not\nbe counted as votes cast on the proposal. To\nabstain, you must check the \u201cAbstain\u201d box on\nyour proxy card, or select the appropriate\noption when voting by Internet or telephone. A\nbroker non-vote is treated as a failure to\nvote. Therefore, if you do not provide\ninstructions to your broker or bank regarding\nhow to vote on a proposal that is a non-\nroutine item, your shares will not be counted\nas votes cast on that proposal. If you are a\nshareholder of record and you sign, date and\nreturn your proxy card but do not provide\nvoting instructions, or you submit your proxy\nby Internet or telephone and do not provide\nvoting instructions, we will vote your shares\nrepresented by that proxy as recommended by\nthe Board and those shares will be counted as\nvotes cast.\n\nElection of directors (Item 1). Under\nPennsylvania law, unless a company\u2019s articles\nof incorporation or by-laws provide otherwise,\ndirectors are elected by a plurality of the\nvotes cast. Our By-laws include an eligibility\nrequirement for director nominees in\nuncontested elections, whereby an incumbent\ndirector will offer to resign from the Board\nif he or she does not receive a majority of\nthe votes cast. To receive a majority of the\nvotes cast, the shares voted \u201cfor\u201d a\ndirector\u2019s election must exceed 50% of the\ntotal number of shares voted with respect to\nthat director\u2019s election. Our By-laws and\ncorporate governance guidelines describe this\nmajority voting requirement and the related\nprocedure in the event that a director must\ntender his or her resignation to the Board.\nThis is considered a non-routine item, so\nthere may be broker non-votes with respect to\nthis proposal. Broker non-votes and\nabstentions will not be included in the total\nvotes cast and will not affect the results of\nthe vote on this proposal.\n\nRatification of independent registered public\naccounting firm (Item 2). A majority of the\nvotes cast will be required to approve the\nratification of the Audit Committee\u2019s\nselection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nfor 2021 . This is considered a routine item,\nso brokers will have the discretion to vote\nuninstructed shares on behalf of beneficial\nowners with respect to this proposal.\nTherefore, broker non-votes are not expected\nto exist for this proposal, although a broker\nmay otherwise fail to submit a vote. Failures\nby brokers to vote and abstentions will not be\nincluded in the total votes cast and will not\naffect the results of the vote on this\nproposal.\n\n\u201cSay-on-pay\u201d: Advisory vote on executive\ncompensation (Item 3). A majority of the votes\ncast will be required to approve this item, an\nadvisory vote on the compensation of our named\nexecutive officers. Because your vote is\nadvisory, it will not be binding on the Board\nor PNC. This is considered a non-routine item,\nso there may be broker non-votes with respect\nto this proposal. Broker non-votes and\nabstentions will not be included in the total\nvotes cast and will not affect the results of\nthe vote on this proposal.\n\nShareholder proposal (Item 4). A majority of\nthe votes cast will be required to approve the\nshareholder proposal. This is considered a\nnon-routine item, so there may be broker non-\nvotes with respect to this proposal. Broker\nnon-votes and abstentions will not be included\nin the total votes cast and will not affect\nthe results of the vote on this proposal.\n                                              \n  92    THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP,     \n        INC.\u00a0-2021 Proxy Statement            \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2022 ANNUAL   \n  MEETING                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  SEC Rule 14a-8.                             \n                                              \nIf you are a shareholder who would like us to\ninclude your proposal in the notice of our\n2022 annual meeting of shareholders and\nrelated proxy materials, you must comply with\nSEC Rule 14a-8, including with respect to\nsubmission of your proposal by the applicable\ndeadline.
