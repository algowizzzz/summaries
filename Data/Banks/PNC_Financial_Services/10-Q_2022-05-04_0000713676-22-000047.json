(BBVA), a U.S. financial\nholding company conducting its business\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA. PNC paid $11.5 billion\nin cash as consideration for the acquisition.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC\nBank.

Our results for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 reflect\nthe benefit of BBVA's acquired business\noperations.

Our forward-looking financial statements\nare subject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to remain above\nthe economy's long-run average throughout this\nyear. Consumer spending growth will remain\nsolid in 2022 due to good underlying\nfundamentals.\n\n\u2022 Supply chain difficulties will gradually\nease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages\nwill remain a constraint this year, although\nstrong wage growth will support consumer\nspending.\n\n\u2022 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to\nstrong demand but limited supplies coming out\nof the pandemic for some goods and services.\nHigher energy prices are adding to\ninflationary pressures in the first half of\n2022. Inflation will slow in the second half\nof 2022 as pandemic-related supply and demand\nimbalances recede and energy prices stabilize.\nHowever, inflation will also broaden\nthroughout the economy due to wage growth. The\nannual inflation rate will end 2022 above the\nFederal Reserve's long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the fed funds\nrate by 0.50% in May, 0.25% in June, 0.50% in\nJuly, 0.25% in September and 0.25% in December\nto reach a range of 2.00% to 2.25% by the end\nof the year. The FOMC will then further\nincrease the fed funds rate in 2023. Also, the\nFederal Reserve will start to reduce its\nbalance sheet in the next few months.\n\n\u2022 Uncertainty about the outlook has increased\nwith the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding. See the\nStatistical Information (Unaudited) \u2013 Average\nConsolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest\nAnalysis section of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n\nNet interest income decreased $58 million, or\n2%, for the first quarter of 2022 compared to\nthe fourth quarter of 2021, as increased\nsecurities balances, loans outstanding and\nsecurities yields were more than offset by a\ndecline in PPP loan interest income and two\nfewer days in the quarter. Net interest income\nincreased $456 million, or 19%, for the first\nquarter of 2022 compared to the same period in\n2021, as a result of higher interest-earning\nassets, partially offset by lower securities\nand loan yields. Net interest margin increased\n1 basis point in both comparisons.\n\nAverage investment securities of $133.9\nbillion for the first quarter of 2022\nincreased $6.0 billion, or 5%, and $47.5\nbillion, or 55%, compared to the fourth and\nfirst quarters of 2021, respectively. The\nincrease in both comparisons reflected\nsecurities purchases, primarily of U.S.\nTreasury and government agency securities.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2021, the\nincrease was also attributable to the addition\nof BBVA. Average investment securities\nrepresented 27% of average interest-earning\nassets for the first quarter of 2022, 26% for\nthe fourth quarter of 2021 and 21% for the\nfirst quarter of 2021.\n\nAverage loans of $290.7 billion for the first\nquarter of 2022 increased $1.8 billion\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2021, due to\ngrowth in commercial loans, driven by\nincreased utilization of loan commitments and\nnew production, primarily within PNC's\ncorporate banking and business credit\nbusinesses, partially offset by continued PPP\nloan forgiveness. In comparison to the first\nquarter of 2021, average loans increased $52.6\nbillion, or 22%, reflecting the BBVA\nacquisition and commercial loan growth,\npartially offset by PPP loan forgiveness.\nAverage loans represented 59% of average\ninterest-earning assets for the first quarter\nof 2022, 58% for the fourth quarter of 2021\nand 57% for the first quarter of 2021.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nof $62.5 billion for the first quarter of\n2022, decreased $12.8 billion, or 17%, and\n$22.9 billion, or 27%, compared to the fourth\nand first quarters of 2021, respectively. The\ndecrease in both comparisons reflected the\nimpact of securities purchases, lower borrowed\nfunds and higher loans outstanding. In\ncomparison to the first quarter of 2021, the\ndecrease was partially offset by higher\ncustomer deposits.\n\n6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits of $299.5\nbillion for the first quarter of 2022\nincreased $3.3 billion, or 1%, and $47.5\nbillion, or 19%, compared to the fourth and\nfirst quarters of 2021, respectively. Compared\nto the fourth quarter of 2021, the increase\nwas driven by growth in consumer deposits,\npartially offset by commercial deposit\noutflows. The increase in the first quarter\n2021 comparison was primarily attributable to\nthe BBVA acquisition. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits represented 91% of\naverage interest-bearing liabilities for the\nfirst quarter of 2022, 90% for the fourth\nquarter of 2021 and 88% for the first quarter\nof 2021.\n\nAverage borrowed funds of $30.3 billion for\nthe first quarter of 2022 decreased $4.0\nbillion, or 12%, and $4.9 billion, or 14%,\ncompared to the fourth and first quarters of\n2021, respectively, reflecting lower bank\nnotes and senior debt.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 3: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 40% for the first quarter of 2022\nand 44% for the fourth and first quarters of\n2021.\n\nAsset management and brokerage fees decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2021,\nprimarily as a result of lower average equity\nmarkets. The increase compared to the first\nquarter of 2021 was due to higher average\nequity markets and the benefit of BBVA. PNC's\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nof $182 billion at March 31, 2022 decreased\nfrom $192 billion at December 31, 2021,\nlargely driven by lower spot equity markets.\nCompared to March 31, 2021, PNC's\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased $9 billion, primarily due to the\naddition of BBVA and higher spot equity\nmarkets.\n\nCapital markets related revenue decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2021,\nprimarily due to lower merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees. The decrease in the first\nquarter of 2021 comparison was attributable to\nlower credit valuation on customer-related\nderivatives activities, a decline in advisory\nbusiness activity and lower underwriting fees.\n\nCard and cash management revenue decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2021,\nprimarily due to seasonally lower transaction\nvolumes and activity and increased compared to\nthe first quarter of 2021, due to the addition\nof BBVA customers and higher treasury\nmanagement product revenue.\n\nLending and deposit services decreased\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2021 as a\nresult of lower loan commitment fees due to\nhigher utilization rates and increased\ncompared to the first quarter of 2021 due to\nthe benefit of BBVA.\n\nResidential and commercial mortgage decreased\nin both comparisons reflecting lower revenue\nfrom commercial mortgage banking activities.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased in both\ncomparisons, primarily due to lower private\nequity revenue. Additionally, the first\nquarter of 2022 included a net securities loss\nof $4 million compared to a net securities\ngain of $25 million in the first quarter of\n2021.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 7\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 4: Noninterest Expense                \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest expense decreased compared to the\nfourth quarter of 2021, driven by lower\nintegration expenses, personnel costs and\nseasonally lower business activity in the\nfirst quarter of 2022.

well-\npositioned at March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021.\n\n\u2022 Total assets decreased reflecting lower\nbalances held with the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities decreased largely due to\nlower commercial deposits and lower borrowed\nfunds, primarily bank notes and senior debt,\npartially offset by consumer deposit growth.\n\n\u2022 Total equity decreased as net income was\nmore than offset by lower AOCI, primarily\nreflecting the impact of higher rates on net\nunrealized securities losses, share\nrepurchases and dividends paid on common and\npreferred stock.\n\nThe

We manage\nour investment securities portfolio to\noptimize returns, while providing a reliable\nsource of liquidity for our banking and other\nactivities, considering the LCR, NSFR and\nother internal and external guidelines and\nconstraints.\n\n10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Table 8: Investment Securities              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Ratings percentages allocated based on\namortized cost, net of allowance for\ninvestment securities.\n\n(b) Amortized cost is presented net of the\nallowance for investment securities, which\ntotaled $134 million at March 31, 2022 and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities.

We have included credit ratings\ninformation because we believe that the\ninformation is an indicator of the degree of\ncredit risk to which we are exposed. Changes\nin credit ratings classifications could\nindicate increased or decreased credit risk\nand could be accompanied by a reduction or\nincrease in the fair value of our investment\nsecurities portfolio.

We changed our\nintent and committed to hold these high-\nquality securities to maturity in order to\nreduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI\nand tangible capital. See Note 3 Investment\nSecurities in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 1 of\nthis Report for additional details regarding\nthis transfer.\n\nIn April and May 2022, we transferred an\nadditional $50.2 billion of available for sale\nsecurities to held to maturity.

and loan balances,\nreflecting the BBVA acquisition, along with\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\nloans, partially offset by narrower interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits.\n\nNoninterest income increased due to higher\ncard and cash management revenue, driven by\ndebit card, credit card, and merchant\nservices, higher asset management and\nbrokerage fees and lending and deposit\nservices which benefited from the addition of\nBBVA customers and increased business\nactivity.\n\nProvision recapture in the first three months\nof 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of\nimproved COVID-19 related economic conditions\nand changes in portfolio composition.\n\nNoninterest expense increased primarily as a\nresult of the impact of BBVA operating\nexpenses,

deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the\nfirst three months of 2022, average total\ndeposits increased compared to the same period\nin 2021 primarily driven by growth in demand\nand savings deposits which benefited from the\nimpact of the BBVA acquisition and elevated\nbalances from government stimulus payments.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin the first three months of 2022 compared\nwith the same period in 2021. Average consumer\nloans increased 28% due to the impact of the\nBBVA acquisition on all loan classes except\neducation loans, which BBVA did not have in\ntheir loan portfolio. In addition, average\nresidential real estate loans increased due to\ncontinued strength in portfolio originations.\nAverage commercial loans decreased primarily\ndue to forgiveness of PPP loans.\n\nAs a result of the BBVA acquisition, we have\nbecome a coast-to-coast retail bank and added\nover 600 branches across seven states to our\nnetwork. We continue to execute our national\nexpansion strategy, which is designed to grow\ncustomers with digitally-led banking and a\nthin branch network utilizing solution centers\nas we expand into new markets. Solution\ncenters are an emerging branch operating model\nwith a distinctive layout, where routine\ntransactions are supported through a\ncombination of technology and skilled banker\nassistance to create personalized experience\ns. The primary focus of the solution center is\nto bring a community element to our digital\nbanking capabilities and provide a\ncollaborative environment that connects our\ncustomers with our solutions and services,\nbeyond deposits and withdrawals. In total, we\nhave opened 33 solution centers within the\nmarkets of Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver,\nHouston, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Nashville\nand Phoenix. In our expansion markets we offer\nseveral digital products including Virtual\nWallet \u00ae and savings and deposit products, and\nunsecured installment and small business\nloans.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking and investment products. In\n2021, we successfully rolled out Low Cash Mode\n\u00ae to all Virtual Wallet \u00ae customers providing\nthem with the ability to avoid unnecessary\noverdraft fees through real-time intelligent\nalerts, extra time to prevent or address\noverdrafts, and controls to choose whether to\nreturn certain debits rather than the bank\nmaking the decision.\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result, have closed 39 branches in\nthe first three months of 2022, consistent\nwith our plan.\n\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by business assets. Average\nloans for this business increased primarily\ndriven by loans from BBVA, higher utilization\nof loan commitments and new production.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting loans from\nBBVA, partially offset by lower commercial\nmortgage and multifamily agency warehouse\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business declined primarily driven by PPP\nloan forgiveness, partially offset by loans\nfrom BBVA.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased in the\ncomparison reflecting deposits from BBVA. We\ncontinue to actively monitor the interest rate\nenvironment and make adjustments to evolving\nmarket conditions, bank funding needs and\nclient relationship dynamics.\n\nIn 2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s geographic\nexpansion. Following the BBVA acquisition and\nour de novo expansion efforts, we are now a\ncoast-to-coast franchise and operate in the\nlargest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical\nareas.

On a consolidated\nbasis, the revenue from these other services\nis included in net interest income and\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses. The Other\nInformation section in Table 12 includes the\nconsolidated revenue to PNC for treasury\nmanagement and commercial mortgage banking\nservices. A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nWithin Treasury Management, PNC Global\nTransfers provides wholesale money transfer\nprocessing capabilities between the U.S. and\nMexico and other countries primarily in\nCentral and South America. Treasury management\nrevenue is reported in noninterest income and\nnet interest income. Noninterest income\nincludes treasury management product revenue\nless earnings credits provided to customers on\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for\nproducts and services.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nNet interest income primarily includes revenue\nfrom all treasury management customer deposit\nbalances. Compared with the first three months\nof 2021, treasury management revenue increased\ndue to higher noninterest income and higher\ndeposit balances, including the impact of the\nacquisition of BBVA, partially offset by\nnarrower interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income), revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nhedges related to those activities. Total\nrevenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities decreased in the comparison\nprimarily due to lower commercial mortgage\nservicing income and lower revenue from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale.\n\nCapital markets related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The Consolidated Income\nStatement includes the noninterest income to\nPNC for capital markets related products and\nservices. Compared with the first three months\nof 2021, capital markets related noninterest\nincome decreased due to lower credit valuation\non customer-related derivatives activities,\nlower advisory revenue and lower underwriting\nfees. These decreases were partially offset by\nhigher loan syndication fees.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 19\n

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $36.2 billion at March 31, 2022\nwith 43% located in California. Comparable\namounts at December 31, 2021 were $34.9\nbillion and 42%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $16.6 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $7.6 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at March 31, 2022.\nComparable amounts were $15.8 billion and $8.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance of this\nportfolio monthly similarly to residential\nreal estate loans. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit, brokered\nhome equity lines of credit) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold the lien.\nThis information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse a third-party service provider to obtain\nupdated loan information, including lien and\ncollateral data that is aggregated from public\nand private sources.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents certain key\nstatistics related to our home equity\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Table 18: Home Equity Loan Statistics       \n                                              \n                                              \n          Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  5,\u2026    21    %    $  5\u2026     21   %  \n  \u2026       3,\u2026    13            3\u2026     13      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2,\u2026    10            2\u2026     10      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     7            1\u2026      7      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       1,\u2026     5            1\u2026      5      \n  \u2026       966     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026       928     4            9\u2026      4      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       769     3            7\u2026      3      \n  \u2026       5,\u2026    23            5\u2026     23      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  24\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  2\u2026    100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              62    %              62   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              38                   38      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              1\u2026    %             100   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       Ma\u2026                  D\u2026             \n  \u2026       31,                  3\u2026             \n  \u2026       20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                  780                  7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026              67    %              66   %  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at March 31, 2022.\n\n(b) Weighted-averages calculated for the\ntwelve months ended March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $14.8 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.2 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of March 31,\n2022.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower, repayment sources,\nunderlying collateral, and other support given\ncurrent events, economic conditions and\nexpectations. We refine our practices to meet\nthe changing environment and the continuing\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate\nlosses and enhance customer support, we have\ncustomer assistance, loan modification and\ncollection programs that align with the CARES\nAct and subsequent interagency guidance. As a\nresult, under the CARES Act credit reporting\nrules, certain loans modified due to COVID-19\nrelated hardships are not being reported as\npast due as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021 based on the contractual terms of the\nloan, even where borrowers may not be making\npayments on their loans during the\nmodification period.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\naccruing loans past due by delinquency status:\n                                              \n  Table 22: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)       \n                                              \n                                              \n                                  %           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Past due loan amounts include government\ninsured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion\nand $0.5 billion at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe decline in accruing loans past due from\nDecember 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the\nresolution of BBVA conversion-related\nadministrative and operational delays.\n\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more\ncontinue to accrue interest because they are\n(i) well secured by collateral and are in the\nprocess of collection, (ii) managed in\nhomogeneous portfolios with specified charge-\noff timeframes adhering to regulatory\nguidelines, or (iii) certain government\ninsured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that met certain\ncriteria under the CARES Act were not\ncategorized as TDRs during the relief period,\nwhich expired on January 1, 2022.

ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and\nPNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as of\nMarch 31, 2022, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank\nexceeded the minimum requirement of 100%.\n\nThe NSFR, which became effective on July 1,\n2021, is designed to measure the stability of\nthe maturity structure of assets and\nliabilities of banking organizations over a\none-year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank are\nrequired to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing\nbasis, and as of March 31, 2022, the NSFR for\nPNC and PNC Bank exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of 100%.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation section of Item 1 Business and Item\n1A Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\n30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits decreased to\n$450.2 billion at March 31, 2022 from $457.3\nbillion at December 31, 2021, driven by\ndecreases in both noninterest-bearing and\ninterest-bearing deposits. See the Funding\nSources portion of the Consolidated Balance\nSheet Review section of this Financial Review\nfor additional information related to our\ndeposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, our liquid assets consisted\nof cash and due from banks and short-term\ninvestments (federal funds sold, resale\nagreements, trading securities and interest-\nearning deposits with banks) totaling $59.9\nbillion and securities available for sale\ntotaling $112.3 billion. The level of liquid\nassets fluctuates over time based on many\nfactors, including market conditions, loan and\ndeposit growth and balance sheet management\nactivities.

The\nFederal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed\nas a primary means of funding our routine\nbusiness activities, but rather as a potential\nsource of liquidity in a stressed environment\nor during a market disruption. At March 31,\n2022, our unused secured borrowing capacity at\nthe FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled\n$96.2 billion.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 31\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At March 31, 2022, there\nwere no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing its\nsenior unsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains liquidity to fund\ndiscretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, available parent company\nliquidity totaled $7.4 billion. Parent company\nliquidity is held in intercompany cash and\ninvestments. For investments with longer\ndurations, the related maturities are aligned\nwith scheduled cash needs, such as the\nmaturity of parent company debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws, regulations and the results of\nsupervisory activities,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a national bank to pay\ndividends or make other capital distributions\nor to extend credit to the parent company or\nits non-bank subsidiaries. The amount\navailable for dividend payments by PNC Bank to\nthe parent company without prior regulatory\napproval was $1.9 billion at March 31, 2022.\nSee Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2021\nForm 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. Authorized by the Board of\nDirectors, the parent company has the ability\nto offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial\npaper to provide additional liquidity. At\nMarch 31, 2022, there were no commercial paper\nissuances outstanding.\n\nThe following table details Parent Company\nnote redemptions in the first quarter of 2022:\n                                              \n  Table 28: Parent Company Notes Redeemed     \n                                              \n                                              \n  Redemption                     Description  \n  Date           Amount          of           \n                                 Redemption   \n                                 $1.0         \n                                 billion of   \n                                 senior       \n                                 notes with   \n                                 a maturity   \n                                 date of      \n                                 March 8,     \n                                 2022.

Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banks to delay the estimated impact\non regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing CECL. CECL\u2019s estimated impact on\nCET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the\nchange in retained earnings at adoption plus\nor minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the\nbalance sheet date, excluding the initial\nallowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to\nCECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first\nquarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period, and the full impact of the\nCECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory\ncapital over the next three years.

These tax\ncredit investment balances included unfunded\ncommitments totaling $2.2 billion at both\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Private equity investments\ncarried at estimated fair value totaled $1.9\nbillion and $1.8 billion at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. As of March\n31, 2022, $1.8 billion was invested directly\nin a variety of companies and $0.1 billion was\ninvested indirectly through various private\nequity funds.\n\nIncluded in our other equity investments are\nVisa Class B common shares, which are recorded\nat cost. Visa Class B common shares that we\nown are transferable only under limited\ncircumstances until they can be converted into\nshares of the publicly-traded Class A common\nshares, which cannot happen until the\nresolution of the pending interchange\nlitigation. Based upon the March 31, 2022 per\nshare closing price of $221.77 for a Visa\nClass A common share, the estimated value of\nour total investment in the Class B common\nshares was approximately $1.3 billion at the\ncurrent conversion rate of Visa B shares to\nVisa A shares, while our cost basis was\ninsignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note\n21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2021 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding our Visa agreements. The estimated\nvalue does not represent fair value of the\nVisa B common shares given the shares' limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies.

The order\naddresses the development of a central bank\ndigital currency in the United States, which\nhas the potential to fundamentally change the\nbusiness of banking and financial services by,\namong other things, significantly reducing\ndeposits held at banks. The order directs the\nSecretary of the Treasury to lead work with a\nnumber of relevant agencies on a report due in\nSeptember 2022 on the future of money and\npayment systems that will include\nconsideration of the implications, benefits,\nand risks of a U.S. central bank digital\ncurrency, and the actions required to launch a\ncentral bank digital currency if doing so is\ndeemed to be in the national interest.\n\nIn March 2022, the SEC released a proposed\nrule that would require public companies, like\nPNC, to include comprehensive climate-related\ninformation in their registration statements\nand periodic reports, including quantitative\nand qualitative data, such as the company\u2019s\ngreenhouse gas emissions, certain climate-\nrelated financial statement metrics and\nrelated disclosures to be included in a note\nto a registrant\u2019s audited financial\nstatements, whether climate-related risks are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact\nover the short, medium, and long term, and the\ncompany\u2019s climate-specific governance and risk\nmanagement processes. The greenhouse gas\nemissions that would have to be disclosed\ninclude the company\u2019s direct emissions from\nowned or controlled sources (Scope 1),\nindirect emissions from the company\u2019s\nconsumption of energy purchased from third\nparties (Scope 2), and, if material or part of\na public emission target or goal, indirect\nemissions from upstream and downstream\nactivities in the company\u2019s value chain (Scope\n3). For large companies like PNC, the Scope 1\nand 2 emission disclosures would require\nattestation from a third party. If adopted in\n2022, these new requirements would begin to\napply to reports filed in 2024, including the\n2023 Form 10-K (though disclosure of Scope 3\nemissions would be delayed for an additional\nyear).\n\nIn March 2022, the SEC released a proposed\nrule that would impose new disclosure\nrequirements on public companies, like PNC,\nregarding cybersecurity risk management,\nstrategy, governance, and incident reporting.\nThe SEC\u2019s proposal would require public\ncompanies to report material cybersecurity\nincidents on Form 8-K within four days of\ndetermining that a material incident occurred\nand would require updates about previously\nreported material cybersecurity incidents\nthrough the company\u2019s Forms 10-K and 10-Q. The\nproposal would also require periodic\ndisclosure of a company\u2019s policies and\nprocedures to identify and manage\ncybersecurity risks, management\u2019s role and\nexpertise in implementing cybersecurity\npolicies, procedures, and strategies, and the\nboard\u2019s oversight role and cybersecurity\nexpertise. Comments on the proposal are due by\nMay 9, 2022. The SEC\u2019s proposal follows the\nFederal Reserve, OCC and FDIC November 2021\ncomputer-security incident notification rule,\nwhich requires banking organizations to notify\ntheir primary federal regulator of certain\ncomputer-security incidents within 36 hours,\nand the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical\nInfrastructure Act of 2022, which directs the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency to promulgate rules to require certain\ncritical infrastructure entities, including\nbanks like PNC Bank, to report certain cyber\nincidents within 72 hours and ransomware\npayments in response to a ransomware attack\nwithin 24 hours.\n                                              \n  C                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  RITICAL                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  A                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CCOUNTING                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  E                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  STIMATES                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  AND                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  J                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  UDGMENTS                                    \n                                              \nNote 1 Accounting Policies in our 2021 Form\n10-K describes the most significant accounting\npolicies that we use to prepare our\nconsolidated financial statements. Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and level 3 fair value\nmeasurements are described in Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7\nof our 2021 Form 10-K. The following details\nthe critical estimates and judgments around\nthe ACL.\n\n38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments. Our\ndetermination of the ACL is based on\nhistorical loss and performance experience, as\nwell as current borrower and transaction\ncharacteristics including collateral type and\nquality, current economic conditions,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nconditions and other relevant factors. We use\nmethods sensitive to changes in economic\nconditions to interpret these factors and to\nestimate expected credit losses. We evaluate\nand, when appropriate, enhance the quality of\nour data and models and other methods used to\nestimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply\nqualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our\nbest estimate of amounts that we do not expect\nto collect because of, among other things,\nidiosyncratic risk factors, changes in\neconomic conditions that may not be reflected\nin forecasted results, or other potential\nmethodology limitations. The major drivers of\nACL estimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on economic conditions\nas of the estimation date. As current economic\nconditions evolve, forecasted losses could be\nmaterially affected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Changes to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Current borrower quality: Our forecast of\nexpected losses depends on current borrower\nand transaction characteristics, including\ncredit metrics and collateral type/quality. As\nborrower quality evolves, forecasted losses\ncould be materially affected.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC, and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios' weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe scenarios used for the period ended March\n31, 2022 reflect a moderate increase in\ndownside risk compared to December 31, 2021.\nThe current outlook considers the inflationary\npressures that have broadened and intensified\nin recent months, along with the projected\nimpact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on\nshort-term growth and inflation in the U.S\neconomy. Our economic outlook also accounts\nfor our expectation that the FOMC will raise\ninterest rates more aggressively than what was\nexpected at December 31, 2021, in line with a\nworsening inflation outlook and FOMC guidance.\nDespite the increasing downside risks,\nexpectations for growth in 2022 remain solid\ndriven by consumer wealth and liquidity.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with the most significant drivers\nbeing Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate.\nThe following table presents a comparison of\nthese two economic variables based on the\nweighted-average scenario forecasts used in\ndetermining our ACL at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 39\nTable 35: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL\nWeighted-Average Scenarios\n                                              \n                 Assumptions                  \n                 as of March                  \n                    31, 2022                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. Real             2.2%    1.4%    1.3%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.3%    4.1%    3.9%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                 Assumptions                  \n                       as of                  \n                December 31,                  \n                        2021                  \n                        2022    2023    2024  \n  U.S. Real             2.8%    1.4%    1.3%  \n  GDP (a)                                     \n  U.S.                                        \n  Unemploym\u2026            4.4%    4.1%    3.9%  \n  Rate (b)                                    \n                                              \n(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.\n\n(b) Represents quarterly average rate at\nDecember 31 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to end 2022 at\n2.2% on a weighted average basis, down from\nthe 2.8% assumed at December 31, 2021 due\nprimarily to slower short-term growth in the\nearly part of 2022. Growth then slows to 1.4%\nand 1.3% in 2023 and 2024 consistent with the\nweighted average expectations at year-end. The\nimprovement in the labor market has outpaced\nexpectations from the end of 2021. As such,\nthe weighted-average projection of the\nunemployment rate is expected to end 2022 at\n4.3% and 2023 at 4.1%. This is a slight\nimprovement from the weighted-average\nprojections as of December 31, 2021, which had\nthe unemployment rate reaching 4.4% in 2022.\n\nThe economy has seen significant recovery from\nthe onset of the pandemic. National\nmacroeconomic indicators, forecasts and\nperformance expectations have all steadily\nimproved, helping to lower overall loss\nexpectations. These improvements continued to\nbe reflected in the reserve releases in the\nfirst quarter of 2022, including in certain\nsegments initially impacted by COVID-19\nrelated restrictions. However, for certain\nportions of our commercial and consumer\nportfolios, considerable uncertainty remains\nregarding lifetime losses. For commercial\nborrowers, there are still lingering concerns\naround certain industries that have been\naffected by COVID-19 related restrictions and\nemerging secular changes. For consumer\nborrowers, higher inflation risk and fading\neffects of government stimulus could reduce\nconsumer liquidity and change payment\nhierarchy. As such, for both our commercial\nand consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified\nand performed significant analysis around\nthese segments to ensure our reserves are\nadequate in the current economic environment.\nWhile we retain some portion of COVID-19\nrelated risk, we believe that this continues\nto reduce with the passage of time. In\naddition to COVID related concerns, elevated\nconsumer liquidity and increased demand for\ngoods has resulted in pressure on the global\nsupply chain. While global economies continue\nto recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,\nmanufacturing capacity and delivery times have\nexperienced numerous disruptions. The supply\nchain reserve impacts observed to-date have\nbeen limited to PNC\u2019s commercial and\nindustrial customers. Furthermore, as the conf\nlict between Russia and Ukraine began in late\nFebruary, supply chain pressures were further\nstressed as assets, employees, and outputs\nfrom both regions are effectively cut off from\nthe global supply chain. The impact of these\nissues on PNC's customers are quantitatively\nand qualitatively assessed, with increased\nrisk likely to continue to materialize.\n\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively\nreflect the distribution of potential economic\noutcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and\ngranular analysis we have addressed reserve\nrequirements for specific populations most\naffected in the current environment. Through\nthis approach, we believe the reserve levels\nappropriately reflect the expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio as of the balance\nsheet date.\n\nSee the following for additional details on\nthe components of our ACL:\n\n\u2022 Allowance For Credit Losses in the Credit\nRisk Management section of this Financial\nReview, and\n\n\u2022 Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 4\nLoans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Report.\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Recently Issued Accounting Standards        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022Required                    \n                 effective                    \n                 date of                      \n                 January 1,                   \n                 2023; early                  \n                 adoption is                  \n                 permitted.                   \n                 \u2022Eliminates                  \n                 the                          \n                 accounting                   \n                 guidance                     \n                 for TDRs                     \n                 and                          \n                 requires an                  \n                 entity to                    \n                 apply the                    \n                 loan                         \n                 refinancing                  \n                 and                          \n                 restructur\u2026                  \n                 guidance to                  \n                 determine                    \n                 whether a                    \n                 modificati\u2026                  \n                 results in                   \n                 a new loan                   \n                 or a                         \n                 continuati\u2026                  \n                 of an                        \n                 existing                     \n                 loan.                        \n                 \u2022Enhances      \u2022We are       \n                 disclosure     currently     \n                 requiremen\u2026    working on    \n                 for certain    our plan to   \n                 loan           adopt the     \n                 refinancin\u2026    standard.     \n                 and            We do not     \n                 restructur\u2026    expect the    \n                 by             adoption of   \n                 creditors      this          \n  Troubled       when a         standard to   \n  Debt           borrower is    materially    \n  Restructur\u2026    experienci\u2026    impact our    \n  and Vintage    financial      consolidated  \n  Disclosures    difficulty.    results of    \n  - ASU          \u2022Requires      operations    \n  2022-02        disclosure     or our        \n  Issued         of             consolidated  \n  March 2022     current-pe\u2026    financial     \n                 gross          position.

These statements are based on\nour views that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy continues to recover from\nthe pandemic-caused recession in the first\nhalf of 2020. Growth is likely to remain above\nthe economy\u2019s long-run average throughout this\nyear. Consumer spending growth will remain\nsolid in 2022 due to good underlying\nfundamentals.\n\n\u2013 Supply-chain difficulties will gradually\nease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages\nwill remain a constraint this year, although\nstrong wage growth will support consumer\nspending\n\n\u2013 Inflation accelerated in the second half of\n2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to\nstrong demand but limited supplies coming out\nof the pandemic for some goods and services.\nHigher energy prices are adding to\ninflationary pressures in the first half of\n2022. Inflation will slow in the second half\nof 2022 as pandemic-related supply and demand\nimbalances recede and energy prices stabilize.\nHowever, inflation will also broaden\nthroughout the economy due to wage growth. The\nannual inflation rate will end 2022 above the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s long-run objective of 2%.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 0.50% in May, 0.25% in June,\n0.50% in July, 0.25% in September and 0.25% in\nDecember to reach a range of 2.00% to 2.25% by\nthe end of the year. The FOMC will then\nfurther increase the federal funds rate in\n2023. Also, the Federal Reserve will start to\nreduce its balance sheet in the next few\nmonths.\n\n\u2013 Uncertainty about the outlook has increased\nwith the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has\ncreated additional risk to higher inflation\nthis year, which could lead the FOMC to\ntighten more aggressively than currently\nanticipated. In addition, risks to growth and\nthe likelihood of a recession in late 2022 or\n2023 have increased.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding an SCB established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal\nReserve Board's CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n42 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 We grow our business in part through\nacquisitions and new strategic initiatives.\nRisks and uncertainties include those\npresented by the nature of the business\nacquired and strategic initiative, including\nin some cases those associated with our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic or other\nmarkets and risks resulting from our\ninexperience in those new areas, as well as\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nacquisition transactions themselves,\nregulatory issues, and the integration of the\nacquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nMany of these risks and uncertainties are\npresent in our acquisition and integration of\nBBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary,\nBBVA USA.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures, security\nbreaches, cyberattacks or international\nhostilities through impacts on the economy and\nfinancial markets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2021 Form 10-K\nand elsewhere in this Report, including in the\nRisk Factors and Risk Management sections and\nthe Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nin these reports.

Our results for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022 reflect\nthe benefit of BBVA's acquired business\noperations. PNC's balance sheets at March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021 include BBVA's\nbalances. See Note 2 Acquisition and\nDivestiture Activity for additional\ninformation related to this acquisition.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to\npresent fairly our results for the interim\nperiods. The results of operations for interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the full year\nor any other interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.

PNC did not acquire the\nfollowing entities as part of the acquisition:\nBBVA Securities, Inc., Propel Venture Partners\nFund I, L.P. and BBVA Processing Services,\nInc. This transaction has been accounted for\nas a business combination. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA were recorded\nat fair value as of the acquisition date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA are subject\nto adjustment for up to one year after the\nclosing date of the acquisition as additional\ninformation becomes available. Valuations\nsubject to adjustment include, but are not\nlimited to, loans, certain deposits, certain\nother assets, customer relationships and the\ncore deposit intangibles.\n\nOn October 12, 2021, PNC converted\napproximately 2.6million customers,\n9,000employees and over 600branches across\nsevenstates, merging BBVA USA into PNC Bank.\n\nPNC incurred merger and integration costs of $\n31million for the three months ended March 31,\n2022, in connection with the transaction.\nThese costs are recorded as contra-revenue and\nexpense on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nThe integration expenses are primarily related\nto realty services and technology expenses.\nCumulative costs through March 31, 2022 were $\n836million.\n\nThe following table includes the preliminary\nfair value of the identifiable tangible and\nintangible assets and liabilities from BBVA:\n\nTable 36: Acquisition Consideration\n                                              \n                                June 1, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In millions                     Fair Value  \n  Fair value of                               \n  acquisition                $        11,480  \n  consideration                               \n  Assets                                      \n  Cash and due from banks    $           969  \n  Interest-earning                    13,313  \n  deposits with banks                         \n  Loans held for sale                    463  \n  Investment securities\u00a0\u2013             18,358  \n  available for sale                          \n  Net loans                           61,423  \n  Equity investments                     723  \n  Mortgage servicing                      35  \n  rights                                      \n  Core deposit                                \n  intangibles and other                  378  \n  intangible                                  \n  assets                                      \n  Other                                3,527  \n  Total assets               $        99,189  \n  Liabilities                                 \n  Deposits                   $        85,562  \n  Borrowed funds                       2,449  \n  Accrued expenses and                 1,275  \n  other liabilities                           \n  Total liabilities          $        89,286  \n  Noncontrolling                          22  \n  interests                                   \n  Less: Net assets           $         9,881  \n  Goodwill                   $         1,599  \n                                              \nPreliminary goodwill of $ 1.6billion recorded\nin connection with the transaction resulted\nfrom the reputation, operating model and\nexpertise of BBVA.

The amortized cost of held to\nmaturity securities included net unrealized\nlosses of $ 1.3billion related to securities\ntransferred, which are offset in AOCI, net of\ntax.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Total shareholders\u2019 equity\nas AOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at March 31, 2022\nincluded $ 0.8billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for March 31, 2021 was $\n1.8billion.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, we transferred securities\nwith a fair value of $ 18.7billion from\navailable for sale to held to maturity. The\nsecurities transferred included $ 9.2billion\nof U.S. Treasury and government agency\nsecurities and $ 9.5billion of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities. We\nchanged our intent and committed to hold these\nhigh-quality securities to maturity in order\nto reduce the impact of price volatility on\nAOCI and tangible capital. The securities were\nreclassified at fair value at the time of the\ntransfer and the transfer represented a non-\ncash transaction. AOCI included net pretax\nunrealized losses of $ 1.3billion at transfer.\nThese unrealized losses will be amortized,\nconsistent with the amortization of the\ndiscount on these securities, over the\nremaining life as an adjustment of yield,\nresulting in no impact to net interest income\nor net income.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date to\nabsorb expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. At March 31, 2022, the allowance\nfor investment securities was $ 134million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities in the available\nfor sale portfolio. The comparable amount at\nDecember 31, 2021 was $ 133million. See Note 1\nAccounting Policies included in Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, AOCI included pretax losses\nof $ 22.1million from derivatives that hedged\nthe purchase of investment securities\nclassified as held to maturity. The losses\nwill be accreted to interest income as an\nadjustment of yield on the securities.\n\nTable 38 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021. These securities are\nsegregated between investments that had been\nin a continuous unrealized loss position for\nless than twelve months and twelve months or\nmore, based on the point in time that the fair\n\n52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nvalue declined below the amortized cost basis.\nAll securities included in the table have been\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. As part of that assessment, as of\nMarch 31, 2022, we concluded that we do not\nintend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 38: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 42 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We\nmanage credit risk based on the risk profile\nof the borrower, repayment sources, underlying\ncollateral and other support given current\nevents, economic conditions and expectations.\nWe refine our practices to meet the changing\nenvironment and the continuing effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and\nenhance customer support, we have customer\nassistance, loan modification and collection\nprograms that align with the CARES Act and\nsubsequent interagency guidance.

This\ndecline was primarily driven by the impacts\nfrom improved COVID-19 related economic\nconditions. The following summarizes the\nchanges in these factors that influenced the\nACL during the three months ended March 31,\n2022:\n\n\u2022 The improved economic conditions were\nreflected in the overall reduction of\nqualitative factor reserves at March 31, 2022\nand were attributable to the recovery seen in\nspecific high-risk segments of our commercial\nand consumer portfolios impacted by the\npandemic. This reduction was partially offset\nby increased reserves that were added to\naccount for the elevated risk associated with\nsupply chain disruptions.\n\nN OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nAs more fully described in Note 5 Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities and Variable Interest\nEntities in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K, we\nhave transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement. Our continuing involvement in the\nFNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, Non-\nagency securitizations and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing,\nrepurchasing previously transferred loans\nunder certain conditions and loss share\narrangements, and, in limited circumstances,\nholding of mortgage-backed securities issued\nby the securitization SPEs.\n\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for\nour role as servicer and, depending on the\ncontractual terms of the servicing\narrangement, we can be terminated as servicer\nwith or without cause. At the consummation\ndate of each type of loan transfer where we\nretain the servicing, we recognize a servicing\nright at fair value. See Note 8 Commitments\nand Note 11 Fair Value for information on our\nservicing rights, including the carrying value\nof servicing assets.\nThe following table provides cash flows\nassociated with our loan sale and servicing\nactivities:\nTable 49: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities\n                                              \n  In                                          \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Cash                                        \n  Flows                                       \n  -                                           \n  Three                                       \n  mont\u2026                                       \n  ended                                       \n  March                               Comme\u2026  \n  31,                Resi\u2026            Mortg\u2026  \n  2022               Mort\u2026            (a)     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Sales                                       \n  of       $  1,894           $  910          \n  loans                                       \n  (b)                                         \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  prev\u2026    $     48           $   27          \n  tran\u2026                                       \n  loans                                       \n  (c)                                         \n  Serv\u2026                                       \n  fees     $     93           $   42          \n  (d)                                         \n  Serv\u2026                                       \n  adva\u2026    $     32           $   21          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  net                                         \n  Cash                                        \n  flows                                       \n  on                                          \n  mort\u2026    $  1,296           $   14          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  held                                        \n  (e)                                         \n  Cash                                        \n  Flows                                       \n  -                                           \n  Three                                       \n  mont\u2026                                       \n  ended                                       \n  March                                       \n  31,                                         \n  2021                                        \n  Sales                                       \n  of       $  1,239           $  988          \n  loans                                       \n  (b)                                         \n  Repu\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  prev\u2026    $     93           $   33          \n  tran\u2026                                       \n  loans                                       \n  (c)                                         \n  Serv\u2026                                       \n  fees     $     82           $   38          \n  (d)                                         \n  Serv\u2026                                       \n  adva\u2026    $     17           $  -10          \n  reco\u2026                                       \n  net                                         \n  Cash                                        \n  flows                                       \n  on                                          \n  mort\u2026    $  2,555           $   29          \n  secu\u2026                                       \n  held                                        \n  (e)                                         \n                                              \n(a) Represents cash flow information\nassociated with both commercial mortgage loan\ntransfers and servicing activities.\n(b) Gains/losses recognized on sales of loans\nwere insignificant for the periods presented.\n(c) Includes both residential and commercial\nmortgage government insured or guaranteed\nloans eligible for repurchase through the\nexercise of our ROAP option, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans repurchased due to\nalleged breaches of origination covenants or\nrepresentations and warranties made to\npurchasers.\n(d) Includes contractually specified servicing\nfees, late charges and ancillary fees.\n(e) Represents cash flows on securities where\nwe transferred to and/or service loans for a\nsecuritization SPE and we hold securities\nissued by that SPE.

We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 51\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is insignificant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE. In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 51.

MSRs are\nrecognized either when purchased or when\noriginated loans are sold with servicing\nretained. MSRs totaled $ 2.2billion at March\n31, 2022 and $ 1.8billion at December 31,\n2021, and consisted of loan servicing\ncontracts for commercial and residential\nmortgages measured at fair value.\n\nMSRs are subject to changes in value from\nactual or expected prepayment of the\nunderlying loans and defaults, as well as\nmarket driven changes in interest rates. We\nmanage this risk by economically hedging the\nfair value of MSRs with securities, derivative\ninstruments and resale agreements which are\nexpected to increase (or decrease) in value\nwhen the value of MSRs decreases (or\nincreases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 6 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

The\nexpected and actual rates of mortgage loan\nprepayments are significant factors driving\nthe fair value. Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 53 and 54. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive\n\n66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nchanges in prepayment rate estimates, could\nresult in changes in the interest rate\nspread), which could either magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions.\n\nTable 53:

Approximately 97% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass as of March 31, 2022, with the\nremainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them.

Fair value is\ndefined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or the price that would be paid\nto transfer a liability on the measurement\ndate, and is determined using an exit price in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. The\nfair value hierarchy established by GAAP\nrequires us to maximize the use of observable\ninputs when measuring fair value. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, see Note 15 Fair Value in Item 8 of\nour 2021 Form 10-K. Additionally, for more\ninformation regarding the fair value of assets\nand liabilities from our BBVA acquisition, see\nNote 2 Acquisition Activity in this Report and\nNote 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in\nthe Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\n\nFor more information on the valuation\nmethodologies used to measure assets and\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, see Note 15 Fair Value in Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K. The following table summarizes\nour assets and liabilities measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including\ninstruments for which we have elected the fair\nvalue option.\nTable 62: Fair Value Measurements \u2013 Recurring\nBasis Summary\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Certain investments that are measured at\nfair value using the NAV per share (or its\nequivalent) practical expedient have not been\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(b) Included in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c) Amounts at March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021 are presented gross and are not reduced\nby the impact of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements that allow us to net\npositive and negative positions and cash\ncollateral held or placed with the same\ncounterparty.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow March 31, 2022,\nwe expect to reclassify net derivative losses\nof $ 300million pretax, or $ 231million after-\ntax, from AOCI to interest income for these\ncash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified\namount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates,\nhedge de-designations and the addition of\nother hedges subsequent to March 31, 2022. As\nof March 31, 2022, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged\nis ten years.\nFurther detail regarding gains (losses)\nrelated to our fair value and cash flow

OTC cleared derivative\ninstruments are typically settled in cash each\nday based on the prior day value.\nTable 73: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nOffsetting\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Represents the net amount of derivative\nassets included in Other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b) Represents the net amount of derivative\nliabilities included in Other liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements\nand other collateral agreements to reduce\ncredit risk associated with derivative\ninstruments, we also seek to manage credit\nrisk by evaluating credit ratings of\ncounterparties and by using internal credit\nanalysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, cash and debt securities\n(primarily agency mortgage-backed securities)\ntotaling $ 1.5billion were pledged to us under\nmaster netting agreements and other collateral\nagreements to collateralize net derivative\nassets due from counterparties and to meet\ninitial margin requirements, and we pledged\ncash and debt securities (primarily agency\nmortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n4.4billion under these agreements to\ncollateralize net derivative liabilities owed\nto counterparties and to meet initial margin\nrequirements. These totals may differ from the\namounts presented in the preceding offsetting\ntable because these totals may include\ncollateral exchanged under an agreement that\ndoes not qualify as a master netting agreement\nor because the total amount of collateral\npledged\n\n82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nexceeds the net derivative fair values with\nthe counterparty as of the balance sheet date\ndue to timing or other factors, such as\ninitial margin. To the extent not netted\nagainst the derivative fair values under a\nmaster netting agreement, the receivable for\ncash pledged is included in Other assets and\nthe obligation for cash held is included in\nOther liabilities on our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Securities pledged to us by\ncounterparties are not recognized on our\nbalance sheet. Likewise, securities we have\npledged to counterparties remain on our\nbalance sheet.\n\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\n\nCertain derivative agreements contain various\ncredit-risk related contingent provisions,\nsuch as those that require our debt to\nmaintain a specified credit rating from one or\nmore of the major credit rating agencies. If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions. The following table\npresents the aggregate fair value of\nderivative instruments with credit-risk-\nrelated contingent features, the associated\ncollateral posted in the normal course of\nbusiness and the maximum amount of collateral\nwe would be required to post if the credit-\nrisk-related contingent features underlying\nthese agreements had been triggered on March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nTable 74: Credit-Risk Contingent Features\n                                              \n                   March             Decemb\u2026  \n  In               31                31       \n  bill\u2026            2022              2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net                                         \n  deri\u2026                                       \n  liab\u2026                                       \n  with     $  5.0            $  2.4           \n  cred\u2026                                       \n  cont\u2026                                       \n  feat\u2026                                       \n  Coll\u2026       3.2               1.8           \n  post\u2026                                       \n  Maxi\u2026                                       \n  addi\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026    $  1.8            $  0.6           \n  of                                          \n  coll\u2026                                       \n  expo\u2026                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  13 L                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGAL P ROCEEDINGS                           \n                                              \nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings,\nincluding litigation and regulatory and\ngovernmental investigations and inquiries,\nwhen information related to the loss\ncontingencies represented by those matters\nindicates both that a loss is probable and\nthat the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our\n2021 Form 10-K (such prior disclosure referred\nto as \u201cPrior Disclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed\nMatters where we are able to estimate such\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses,\nas of March 31, 2022, we estimate that it is\nreasonably possible that we could incur losses\nin excess of related accrued liabilities, if\nany, in an aggregate amount less than $\n300million. The estimates included in this\namount are based on our analysis of currently\navailable information and are subject to\nsignificant judgment and a variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties. As new\ninformation is obtained we may change our\nestimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of\nthe assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts\naccrued or included in this aggregate amount\nmay not represent the ultimate loss to us from\nthe legal proceedings in question. Thus, our\nexposure and ultimate losses may be higher,\nand possibly significantly so, than the\namounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item\n8 of our 2021 Form 10-K, we are unable, at\nthis time, to estimate the losses that are\nreasonably possible to be incurred or ranges\nof such losses with respect to some of the\nmatters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated\namount provided above does not include an\nestimate for every Disclosed Matter.\nTherefore, as the estimated aggregate amount\ndisclosed above does not include all of the\nDisclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above\ndoes not represent our maximum reasonably\npossible loss exposure for all of the\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 83\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\n\nIn March 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard denied inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) with\nrespect to PNC\u2019s petitions for two of the six\npatents at issue in United Services Automobile\nAssociation v.

In some cases, these\ninquiries are part of reviews of specified\nactivities at multiple industry participants;\nin others, they are directed at PNC\nindividually. From time to time, these\ninquiries have involved and may in the future\ninvolve or lead to regulatory enforcement\nactions and other administrative proceedings.\nThese inquiries have also led to and may in\nthe future lead to civil or criminal judicial\nproceedings. Some of these inquiries result in\nremedies including fines, penalties,\nrestitution, or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs and other consequences. Such\nremedies and other consequences typically have\nnot been material to us from a financial\nstandpoint, but could be in the future. Even\nif not financially material, they may result\nin significant reputational harm or other\nadverse consequences.\n\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with\nregulatory and governmental investigations,\naudits and other inquiries, including those\ndescribed in Prior Disclosure.\n\nOther\n\nIn addition to the proceedings or other\nmatters described in Prior Disclosure, PNC and\npersons to whom we may have indemnification\nobligations, in the normal course of business,\nare subject to various other pending and\nthreatened legal proceedings in which claims\nfor monetary damages and other relief are\nasserted. We do not anticipate, at the present\ntime, that the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of such other legal\nproceedings will have a material adverse\neffect on our financial position. However, we\ncannot now determine whether or not any claims\nasserted against us or others to whom we may\nhave indemnification obligations, whether in\nthe proceedings or other matters described\nabove or otherwise, will have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations in\nany future reporting period, which will depend\non, among other things, the amount of the loss\nresulting from the claim and the amount of\nincome otherwise reported for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  N                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  OTE                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  14 S                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGMENT R EPORTING                           \n                                              \nWe have threereportable business segments:\n\n\u2022 Retail Banking\n\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n\u2022 Asset Management Group\n\nResults of individual businesses are presented\nbased on our internal management reporting\npractices.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of\n\ncommon stock repurchases depending on a number\nof factors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative\n\nuses of capital, the potential impact on our\ncredit ratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy\n\nand capital planning processes undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR\nprocess, which includes setting PNC's SCB. The\nSCB framework allows for capital returns in\namounts up to the level of capital in excess\nof the SCB minimum. Consistent with the\nflexibility provided under the SCB framework,\nour Board of Directors has recently authorized\na new share repurchase structure, under the\nalready approved authorization for repurchases\nof up to 100 million common shares, of which\napproximately 64% were still available at\nMarch 31, 2022. This structure allows for the\ncontinuation of our recent quarterly average\nshare repurchase levels as well as the\nflexibility to increase those levels should\nconditions warrant.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 93\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 6.
