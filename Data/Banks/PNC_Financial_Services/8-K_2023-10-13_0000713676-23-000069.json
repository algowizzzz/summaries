Affected employees were informed of\nthe workforce reduction beginning on October\n6, 2023. The Corporation expects to incur one-\ntime, pre-tax charges and costs associated\nwith these actions of approximately $150\nmillion, primarily related to cash severance,\nbenefits and related termination costs. The\nCorporation expects that the majority of the\ncharges will be incurred in the fourth quarter\nof 2023. The Corporation anticipates that\nimplementation of the workforce reduction will\nbe almost entirely complete in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, and will reduce personnel\nexpenses by approximately $325 million, or 5\npercent, annually (estimated based on the\nannualized pre-reduction personnel expense of\naffected employees, compared to total\npersonnel expense).\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation\n\nThis Report contains forward-looking\nstatements regarding the Corporation\u2019s\nanticipated size and timing of a workforce\nreduction, and the associated costs and cash\nexpenditures and savings.
