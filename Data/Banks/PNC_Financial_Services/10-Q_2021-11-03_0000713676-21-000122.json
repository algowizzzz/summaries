2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2020 Form\n10-K). We have reclassified certain prior\nperiod amounts to conform with the current\nperiod presentation, which we believe is more\nmeaningful to readers of our consolidated\nfinancial statements.

Also, see\nthe Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Information section in this Financial\nReview and the Critical Accounting Estimates\nand Judgments section in this Financial Review\nand in our 2020 Form 10-K for certain other\nfactors that could cause actual results or\nfuture events to differ, perhaps materially,\nfrom historical performance and from those\nanticipated in the forward-looking statements\nincluded in this Report.

Executive Summary and Consolidated\nIncome Statement Review portions of this\nFinancial Review section provide information\nregarding items impacting the comparability of\nthe periods presented.\n\n(b) Dividends are payable quarterly other than\nSeries R and Series S preferred stock, which\nare payable semiannually. On September 13,\n2021, PNC issued 1,500,000 depositary shares\neach representing 1/100th ownership in a share\nof 3.400% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative\nperpetual preferred stock, Series T, with a\npar value of $1 per share. Beginning on\nDecember 15, dividends will be paid on the\nSeries T on a quarterly basis (March 15, June\n15, September 15 and December 15 of each\nyear).\n\n(c) The effective income tax rates are\ngenerally lower than the statutory rate due to\nthe relationship of pretax income to tax\ncredits and earnings that are not subject to\ntax.\n\n(d) Net interest margin is the total yield on\ninterest-earning assets minus the total rate\non interest-bearing liabilities and includes\nthe benefit from use of noninterest-bearing\nsources. To provide more meaningful\ncomparisons of net interest margins, we use\nnet interest income on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis in calculating average yields used in\nthe calculation of net interest margin by\nincreasing the interest income earned on tax-\nexempt assets to make it fully equivalent to\ninterest income earned on taxable investments.\nThis adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in\nthe Consolidated Income Statement.

(BBVA), a U.S. financial\nholding company conducting its business\noperations primarily through its U.S. banking\nsubsidiary, BBVA USA. PNC paid $11.5 billion\nin cash as consideration for the acquisition.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC\nBank. As of October 12, 2021, PNC has\nconverted approximately 2.6 million customers,\n9,000 employees and over 600 branches across\nseven states. PNC\u2019s third quarter results\nreflect the full quarter benefit of BBVA\u2019s\nacquired business operations. Our results for\nthe first nine months of 2021 reflect the\nbenefit of BBVA's acquired business operations\nfor the period since the acquisition closed on\nJune 1, 2021. PNC\u2019s balance sheet at September\n30, 2021 includes BBVA\u2019s balances.

Earnings were $3.30 per\ndiluted common share for the third quarter of\n2021 compared to $3.39 per diluted common\nshare for the third quarter of 2020. Other\nthan the impact of the BBVA acquisition, the\ndecrease was primarily due to a lower\neffective tax rate in the third quarter of\n2020 as a result of tax credit benefits and\nthe favorable resolution of certain tax\nmatters.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 3\n\u2022 For the three months ended September 30,\n2021 compared to the same period in 2020:\n\n\u2022 Total revenue increased $916 million, or\n21%, to $5.2 billion.\n\n\u2022 Net interest income of $2.9 billion\nincreased $372 million, or 15%, primarily due\nto the benefit of BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Net interest margin decreased 12 basis\npoints to 2.27% reflecting lower securities\nyields.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $544 million,\nor 30%, to $2.3 billion, primarily due to\nrecord merger and acquisition advisory fees\nand the benefit of BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Provision recapture was $203 million for the\nthird quarter of 2021 driven by continued\nimprovements in credit quality and changes in\nportfolio composition. Provision for credit\nlosses was $52 million for the third quarter\nof 2020.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion,\nor 42%, to $3.6 billion, due to BBVA operating\nexpenses, integration expenses and increased\nbusiness and marketing activity.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nIncome Statement Review section of this\nFinancial Review.\n                                              \n  Balance Sheet Highlights                    \n                                              \nOur balance sheet was strong and well\npositioned at September 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020. In comparison to December 31, 2020,\nchanges in our balance sheet were primarily\ndriven by the BBVA acquisition.\n\n\u2022 Total assets increased $86.8 billion, or\n19%, to $553.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total loans increased $48.3 billion, or 20%,\nto $290.2 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total commercial loans increased $28.0\nbillion, or 17%, to $195.2 billion driven by\nBBVA loans, partially offset by PPP loan\nforgiveness.\n\n\u2022 At September 30, 2021, PNC had $6.8 billion\nof PPP loans. PPP loans outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2020 were $12.0 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total consumer loans increased $20.3\nbillion, or 27%, to $95.0 billion driven by\nloans from BBVA and increased originations of\nPNC legacy residential mortgages, partially\noffset by declines in PNC legacy home equity\nand auto loan portfolios.\n\n\u2022 Investment securities increased $36.8\nbillion, or 41%, to $125.6 billion, resulting\nfrom increased purchase activity and\nsecurities from BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Interest-earning deposits with banks,\nprimarily with the Federal Reserve Bank,\ndecreased $9.7 billion to $75.5 billion, and\nincluded the payment for the purchase of BBVA.\n\n\u2022 Total deposits increased $83.6 billion, or\n23%, to $448.9 billion, reflecting deposits\nfrom BBVA and growth in PNC legacy commercial\nand consumer liquidity.\n\n\u2022 Borrowed funds decreased $3.7 billion, or\n10%, to $33.5 billion, due to lower FHLB\nborrowings reflecting the use of liquidity\nfrom deposit growth, partially offset by\nborrowed funds from BBVA.\n\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet Review section of this Financial\nReview.\n                                              \n  Credit Quality Highlights                   \n                                              \nThird quarter 2021 credit quality performance\nreflected the acquisition of BBVA, continued\nimprovements in credit quality and changes in\nportfolio composition.\n\n\u2022 At September 30, 2021 compared to December\n31, 2020:\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming assets of $2.6 billion,\nincreased $222 million, or 9%, due to\nnonperforming assets from BBVA, partially\noffset by lower PNC legacy nonperforming\nassets reflecting improved credit performance.\n\n\u2022 Overall loan delinquencies of $1.4 billion\nincreased $33 million, or 2%, as lower PNC\nlegacy consumer and commercial delinquencies\nwere more than offset by delinquencies from\nthe BBVA acquisition.\n\n\u2022 The ACL related to loans, which consists of\nthe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded\nlending related commitments, totaled $6.0\nbillion at September 30, 2021, an increase of\n$0.1 billion since December 31, 2020. The\nincrease was primarily attributable to the\naddition of reserves related to the BBVA\nacquisition, partially offset by continued\nimprovements in credit quality and\nmacroeconomic factors along with changes in\nportfolio composition.\n\n\u2022 Net charge-offs were $81 million, or 0.11%\nof average loans on an annualized basis in the\nthird quarter of 2021 compared to $155\nmillion, or 0.24%, for the same quarter of\n2020.\n\nFor additional detail see the Credit Risk\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Capital Highlights                          \n                                              \nWe maintained our strong capital and liquidity\npositions.\n\n\u2022 Our CET1 ratio decreased to 10.3% at\nSeptember 30, 2021 from 12.2% at December 31,\n2020, primarily due to the BBVA acquisition.\n\n4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\n\u2022 Capital was impacted by our election of a\nfive-year transition period for CECL\u2019s\nestimated impact on CET1 capital. CECL\u2019s\nestimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as\nthe change in retained earnings at adoption\nplus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at\nthe balance sheet date, excluding the initial\nallowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to\nCECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL\nimpact is added to CET1 capital through\nDecember 31, 2021, then phased-out over the\nfollowing three years.\n\n\u2022 Common shareholders' equity increased to\n$51.3 billion at September 30, 2021, compared\nto $50.5 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\n\u2022 In the third quarter, we returned $0.9\nbillion of capital to shareholders through\ndividends on common shares of $0.5 billion and\n$0.4 billion of common share repurchases\nrepresenting 2.1 million shares.

These statements are based on\nour views, as follows:\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2022 The Delta COVID-19 variant and supply chain\ndifficulties have been drags on economic\ngrowth in the second half of 2021, although\nthe economy continues to expand. Growth will\npick up at the end of 2021 as the impact of\nthe Delta variant fades and supply chains\nnormalize and will remain solid into 2022.\nEmployment in September 2021 was still down by\nalmost 5 million from before the pandemic; PNC\nexpects employment to return to its pre-\npandemic level in mid-2022.\n\n\u2022 Compared to the spring of 2020 (when prices\nwere falling), inflation accelerated in\nmid-2021 due to strong demand in specific\nsegments and supply chain disruptions.\nInflation has started to slow on a month-over-\nmonth basis but will remain elevated in the\nnear term.\n\n\u2022 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25%\nuntil late 2022.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to\nthe third quarter of 2021 where appropriate,\nwe expect:\n\n\u2022 Average loans, excluding PPP loans, up\nmodestly,\n\n\u2022 Net interest income to be up modestly,\n\n\u2022 Fee income to be down approximately 3% to\n5%,\n\n\u2022 Other noninterest income, excluding net\nsecurities gains and Visa activity, to be\nbetween $375 million and $425 million,\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense, excluding integration\nexpense, to be down 3% to 5%, and\n\n\u2022 Net loan charge-offs to be between $100\nmillion and $150 million.\n\nAdditionally, we are on track to realize $900\nmillion in net expense savings of our forecast\nof BBVA\u2019s 2022 expense base. We also expect to\nincur merger and integration costs of\napproximately $980 million, inclusive of the\nwrite-off of certain technology and other\nassets. During the fourth quarter, we expect\nto incur the majority of the remaining merger\nand integration costs of $450 million.\n\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Information section in this\nFinancial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in\nour 2020 Form 10-K for other factors that\ncould cause future events to differ, perhaps\nmaterially, from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements.\n                                              \n   C                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   ONSOLIDATED                                \n                                              \n                                              \n   I                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   NCOME                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   S                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   TATEMENT                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n   R                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   EVIEW                                      \n                                              \nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\n\nNet income from continuing operations of $1.5\nbillion for the third quarter of 2021\ndecreased $42.0 million compared to the third\nquarter of 2020.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargins by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments. This adjustment is not\npermitted under GAAP on the Consolidated\nIncome Statement. For more information, see\nReconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net\nInterest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical\nInformation (Unaudited) section in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nChanges in net interest income and margin\nresult from the interaction of the volume and\ncomposition of interest-earning assets and\nrelated yields, interest-bearing liabilities\nand related rates paid, and noninterest-\nbearing sources of funding.

The increase in both\ncomparisons was primarily due to the benefit\nof BBVA interest-earning asset balances and\nlower deposit rates, partially offset by lower\nyields on securities.\n\nNet interest margin in the quarterly and year-\nto-date comparisons decreased 12 basis points\nand 29 basis points, respectively. The\ndecrease in both comparisons was largely due\nto lower yields on securities. The decrease in\nthe year-to-date comparison also reflected\nhigher balances held at the Federal Reserve\nBank and lower yields on loans, partially\noffset by lower rates paid on deposits and\nborrowings.\n\nAverage investment securities increased $30.1\nbillion, or 33%, and $17.5 billion, or 20%, in\nthe quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,\nrespectively. Both comparisons increased\nprimarily due to the acquisition of BBVA. The\nincrease in the quarterly comparison was also\nattributable to increased purchase activity.\nAverage investment securities represented 24%\nof average interest-earning assets for the\nthird quarter of 2021 and 23% for the first\nnine months of 2021, compared to 22% for both\nperiods in 2020.\n\nAverage loans increased $38.2 billion, or 15%,\nand $7.0 billion, or 3%, in the quarterly and\nyear-to-date comparisons, respectively. The\nincrease in both comparisons was primarily a\nresult of the BBVA acquisition. In the year-\nto-date comparison, the increase was partially\noffset by lower utilization of loan\ncommitments by commercial customers and lower\nconsumer loans. Average loans represented 58%\nof average interest-earning assets for the\nthird quarter of 2021 and 57% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021, compared to\n61% and 65% for the same periods in 2020.\n\nAverage interest-earning deposits with banks\nincreased $19.9 billion and $43.8 billion in\nthe respective quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons, as average balances held with the\nFederal Reserve Bank increased due to higher\nliquidity from deposit growth.\n\nAverage interest-bearing deposits grew $49.9\nbillion, or 20%, and $38.3 billion, or 16% in\nthe respective quarterly and year-to-date\ncomparisons due to overall growth in\ncommercial and consumer liquidity, including\ndeposits from BBVA. In total, average\ninterest-bearing deposits increased to 90% and\n89% of average interest-bearing liabilities\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2021, compared to 85% and 82% for the same\nperiods in 2020.\n\nAverage borrowed funds decreased $9.0 billion,\nor 21%, compared with the third quarter of\n2020 and $16.7 billion, or 33%, compared with\nthe first nine months of 2020 primarily due to\na decline in FHLB borrowings reflecting the\nuse of liquidity from deposit growth.\n\nFurther details regarding average loans and\ndeposits are included in the Business Segments\nReview section of this Financial Review.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Income                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table 3: Noninterest Income                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nNoninterest income as a percentage of total\nrevenue was 45% for the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2021, compared to 42% and\n41% for the same periods in 2020.\n\nAsset management revenue increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons due to\nthe impact of higher average equity markets\nand the benefit of the BBVA acquisition. PNC's\ndiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased to $183 billion at September 30,\n2021 from $158 billion at September 30, 2020,\nprimarily driven by higher spot equity markets\nand the BBVA acquisition.\n\nConsumer services revenue increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nreflecting the addition of BBVA customers and\nthe impacts of higher consumer spending on\ndebit cards, merchant services revenues,\ncredit card fees and growth in brokerage fees\nprimarily due to higher average equity\nmarkets.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                        10-Q 7\nCorporate services revenue increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nprimarily due to higher merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees, treasury management product\nrevenue and equity capital markets advisory\nfees. The year-to-date comparison also\nbenefited from higher revenue from commercial\nmortgage servicing activities.\n\nResidential Mortgage revenue increased in the\nquarterly comparison primarily due to higher\nloan sales revenue and higher mortgage\nservicing rights valuation, net of economic\nhedge. The decrease in the year-to-date\ncomparison was primarily a result of lower\nservicing fee revenue primarily due to higher\npayoffs and lower mortgage servicing rights\nvaluation, net of economic hedge.\n\nService charges on deposits increased in the\nquarterly and year-to-date comparisons\nprimarily due to the addition of BBVA\ncustomers, partially offset by the impact of\nLow Cash Mode SM on overdraft revenue.\n\nOther noninterest income decreased in the\nquarterly comparison due to a negative Visa\nClass B derivative fair value adjustment\nprimarily related to the extension of\nanticipated litigation resolution timing,\npartially offset by higher private equity\nrevenue.

30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020.\n\n\u2022 Total asset growth reflected the addition of\nloans and investment securities from the BBVA\nacquisition, partially offset by a decrease in\ninterest-earning deposits with banks.\n\n\u2022 Total liabilities increased primarily due to\ndeposit growth reflecting higher commercial\nand consumer deposits driven by the\nacquisition of BBVA, partially offset by lower\nborrowed funds.\n\n\u2022 Total equity increased as net income and the\nissuance of preferred stock was partially\noffset by lower AOCI, reflecting the impact of\nhigher rates on net unrealized securities\ngains, dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $6.0 billion\nat September 30, 2021, an increase of $0.1\nbillion since December 31, 2020. The increase\nwas primarily attributable to the addition of\nreserves related to the BBVA acquisition,\npartially offset by continued improvements in\ncredit quality and macroeconomic factors along\nwith changes in portfolio composition.

Changes\nin credit ratings classifications could\nindicate increased or decreased credit risk\nand could be accompanied by a reduction or\nincrease in the fair value of our investment\nsecurities portfolio. We continually monitor\nthe credit risk in our portfolio and maintain\nthe allowance for investment securities at an\nappropriate level to absorb expected credit\nlosses on our investment securities portfolio\nfor the remaining contractual term of the\nsecurities adjusted for expected prepayments.\nSee Note 3 Investment Securities in the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Item 1 of this Report for additional\ndetails regarding the amount of the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nThe duration of investment securities was 3.8\nyears at September 30, 2021.

Certain amounts included in this\nBusiness Segments Review differ from those\namounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the\npresentation in this Financial Review of\nbusiness net interest income on a taxable-\nequivalent basis.\n\nOur business segment results for the first\nnine months of 2021 reflect the benefit of\nBBVA\u2019s business operations for the period\nsince the acquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\nPeriod end information presented includes\nBBVA's balances at September 30, 2021. Until\nthe conversion of bank systems and branches as\nof October 12, 2021, PNC Bank and BBVA\ncustomers were served through their respective\nPNC Bank and BBVA USA branches, websites and\nmobile apps, financial advisors and\nrelationship managers. Following conversion,\nthere will be changes in the segmentation of\nBBVA USA customers as we continue to integrate\ndata to PNC applications, finalize the review\nof customer relationships and better align\ncustomers with PNC\u2019s products and services.\nThese changes will be reflected in fourth\nquarter reporting. See Note 2 Acquisition and\nDivestiture Activity in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Report for additional\ninformation on the acquisition of BBVA.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested\nour entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock,\nwhich had previously been reported as a\nseparate business segment. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Report for\nadditional information.\n\nNet interest income in business segment\nresults reflects our internal funds transfer\npricing methodology. Assets receive a funding\ncharge and liabilities and capital receive a\nfunding credit based on a transfer pricing\nmethodology that incorporates product\nrepricing characteristics, tenor and other\nfactors.\n\nTotal business segment financial results\ndiffer from total consolidated net income. The\nimpact of these differences is reflected in\nthe \u201cOther\u201d category as shown in Table 82 in\nNote 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 1 of this Report. \u201cOther\u201d includes\nresidual activities that do not meet the\ncriteria for disclosure as a separate\nreportable business, such as asset and\nliability management activities including net\nsecurities gains or losses, ACL for investment\nsecurities, certain trading activities,\ncertain runoff consumer loan portfolios,\nprivate equity investments, intercompany\neliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax\nadjustments that are not allocated to business\nsegments, exited businesses and differences\nbetween business segment performance reporting\nand financial statement reporting (GAAP).\n\n12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Retail Banking                              \n                                              \nRetail Banking's core strategy is to help all\nof our consumer and small business customers\nmove financially forward.

2020 driven by a\nprovision recapture and higher net interest\nincome, partially offset by higher noninterest\nexpense. Results for the first nine months of\n2021 reflect the benefit of BBVA's business\noperations since the acquisition closed on\nJune 1, 2021.\n\nNet interest income increased primarily due to\ngrowth in average deposit and loan balances,\nreflecting the BBVA acquisition, along with\nwider interest rate spreads on the value of\nloans, partially offset by narrower interest\nrate spreads on the value of deposits.\n\nNoninterest income decreased due to a larger\nnegative derivative Visa Class B fair value\nadjustment related to the extension of\nlitigation timing in the first nine months of\n2021, along with declines in residential\nmortgage revenue, driven by lower servicing\nfees primarily due to higher payoffs and lower\nrevenue from residential mortgage servicing\nrights valuation, net of economic hedge. The\ndecrease in noninterest income was partially\noffset by the BBVA acquisition, increased\nconsumer services revenue driven by debit card\nand brokerage fees, as well as higher service\ncharges on deposits.\n\nProvision recapture in the first nine months\nof 2021 was driven by improvements in credit\nquality and macroeconomic factors along with\nchanges in portfolio composition, partially\noffset by the additional provision for credit\nlosses related to the BBVA acquisition.\n\n14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nNoninterest expense increased primarily as a\nresult of the impact of BBVA operating\nexpenses, increased marketing activity and\nnon-credit losses due to additions to\nlitigation reserves.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to\nremain disciplined on pricing and focused on\ngrowing and retaining relationship-based\nbalances, executing on market-specific deposit\ngrowth strategies and providing a source of\nlow-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the\nfirst nine months of 2021, average total\ndeposits increased compared to the same period\nin 2020 primarily driven by growth in demand\nand savings deposits which benefited from the\nimpact of continued government stimulus\npayments.\n\nRetail Banking average total loans increased\nin the first nine months of 2021 compared with\nthe same period in 2020 due to the impact of\nthe BBVA acquisition on all loan classes\nexcept education loans, which BBVA did not\nhave in their loan portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Average residential real estate loans\nincreased due to originations outpacing\npaydowns.\n\n\u2022 Average commercial loans increased primarily\ndue to PPP loans.\n\n\u2022 Average auto loan balances declined due to\nimpacts of the pandemic on the auto industry\nand proactive credit tightening.\n\n\u2022 Average credit card balances decreased due\nto changes in customer behavior resulting in\nhigher balance paydowns driven by government\nstimulus payments combined with credit\ntightening actions taken as a result of the\npandemic.\n\n\u2022 Average education loans decreased driven by\na continued decline in the runoff portfolio of\ngovernment guaranteed education loans.\n\n\u2022 Average home equity loans decreased as\npaydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated\nvolume.\n\n\u2022 Average other consumer loans declined driven\nby lower originations due to the pandemic and\nthe effects of government stimulus and credit\ntightening.\n\nOur national expansion strategy is designed to\ngrow customers with digitally-led banking and\na thin branch network as we expand into new\nmarkets. In 2018, we began offering our\ndigital high yield savings deposit product and\nopened our first solution center in Kansas\nCity. Solution centers are an emerging branch\noperating model with a distinctive layout,\nwhere routine transactions are supported\nthrough a combination of technology and\nskilled banker assistance to create\npersonalized experiences. The primary focus of\nthe solution center is to bring a community\nelement to our digital banking capabilities.\nThe solution center provides a collaborative\nenvironment that connects our customers with\nour digital solutions and services, beyond\ndeposits and withdrawals. In 2020, we expanded\ninto three new markets, Boston, Houston and\nNashville and opened seventeen new solution\ncenters. In the first nine months of 2021 we\nopened ten new solution centers and expanded\ninto two new markets, Denver and Phoenix. In\ntotal, we have thirty-two open solution\ncenters within the markets of Boston,\nDallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Kansas\nCity, Nashville and Phoenix. We also offer\ndigital unsecured installment and small\nbusiness loans in the expansion markets. As a\nresult of the BBVA acquisition, we have become\na coast-to-coast Retail Bank and added over\n600 branches across seven states to our\nnetwork.\n\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the\ncustomer experience with refinements to\nproduct and service offerings that drive value\nfor consumers and small businesses. We are\nfocused on meeting the financial needs of our\ncustomers by providing a broad range of\nliquidity, banking and investment products. In\nApril 2021, we announced our Low Cash Mode SM\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae feature which gives all\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae customers the ability to\navoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-\ntime intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent\nor address overdrafts, and controls to choose\nwhether to return certain debits rather than\nthe bank making the decision. Through the end\nof September, we have successfully rolled out\nLow Cash Mode SM to 3.8 million PNC legacy\nVirtual Wallet \u00ae customers and have delivered\nover 10 million Low Cash Mode SM alerts.\n\nUpon conversion, BBVA customers became\neligible for the full suite of PNC products\nand services, including Low Cash Mode SM . Our\nfull year 2021 guidance includes the impact of\nfee reductions on both PNC legacy and the\nconversion of BBVA customers.\n\nSee the Executive Summary section in this\nFinancial Review for additional information on\nour business outlook.\n\nRetail Banking continued to execute on its\nstrategy of transforming the customer\nexperience through transaction channel\nmigration, branch network and home lending\nprocess transformations and multi-channel\nengagement and service strategies. We are also\ncontinually assessing our current branch\nnetwork for optimization opportunities as\nusage of alternative channels has increased\nand as a result have closed 112 branches in\nthe first nine months of 2021, consistent with\nour plan.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 15\n                                              \n  Corporate & Institutional Banking           \n                                              \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\u2019s strategy\nis to be the leading relationship-based\nprovider of traditional banking products and\nservices to its customers through the economic\ncycles.

Results for the first\nnine months of 2021 reflect the benefit of\nBBVA's business operations since the\nacquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\n\nNet interest income increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to wider interest\nrate spreads on the value of loans and higher\naverage deposit balances, reflecting the BBVA\nacquisition, partially offset by narrower\ninterest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits.\n\nGrowth in noninterest income in the comparison\nreflected broad-based increases, including the\nbenefit of BBVA, in capital markets-related\nrevenue, treasury management product revenue\nand revenue from commercial mortgage banking\nactivities.\n\nProvision recapture in the first nine months\nof 2021 was driven by improvements in credit\nquality and macroeconomic factors along with\nchanges in portfolio composition, partially\noffset by the additional provision for credit\nlosses related to the BBVA acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense increased in the\ncomparison largely due to higher variable\ncosts associated with increased business\nactivity and the BBVA acquisition.\n\nAverage loans decreased compared with the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020 due to\ndeclines in Corporate Banking, partially\noffset by increases in Commercial Banking,\nReal Estate and Business Credit:\n\n\u2022 Corporate Banking provides lending,\nequipment finance, treasury management and\ncapital markets-related products and services\nto mid-sized and large corporations, and\ngovernment and not-for-profit entities.\nAverage loans for this business declined\nreflecting lower average utilization of loan\ncommitments, partially offset by loans from\nBBVA and new production.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking provides lending,\ntreasury management and capital markets-\nrelated products and services to smaller\ncorporations and businesses. Average loans for\nthis business increased primarily driven by\nloans from BBVA and PPP loan originations.\n\n\u2022 Real Estate provides banking, financing and\nservicing solutions for commercial real estate\nclients across the country. Average loans for\nthis business increased reflecting loans from\nBBVA, partially offset by lower commercial\nmortgage and multifamily agency warehouse\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Business Credit provides asset-based lending\nand equipment financing solutions. The loan\nand lease portfolio is relatively high\nyielding, with acceptable risk as the loans\nare mainly secured by marketable collateral.\nAverage loans for this business increased\nprimarily driven by new production and loans\nfrom BBVA, partially offset by lower average\nutilization of loan commitments.\n\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate &\nInstitutional Banking is to remain disciplined\non pricing and focused on growing and\nretaining relationship-based balances over\ntime, executing on customer and segment-\nspecific deposit growth strategies and\ncontinuing to provide funding and liquidity to\nPNC. Average total deposits increased in the\ncomparison reflecting customers maintaining\nliquidity due to the economic impacts of the\npandemic. We continue to actively monitor the\ninterest rate environment and make adjustments\nin response to evolving market conditions,\nbank funding needs and client relationship\ndynamics.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking continues to\nexpand its Corporate Banking business, focused\non the middle market and larger sectors. We\nexecuted on our expansion plans into the\nSeattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in\n2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated our\nexpansion efforts across the Southwest;\nhowever this has not changed our strategy\nregarding our de novo expansion efforts. This\nfollows offices opened in Boston and Phoenix\nin 2019, Denver, Houston and Nashville in\n2018, and Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis\nin 2017. These locations complement Corporate\n& Institutional Banking national businesses\nwith a significant presence in these cities\nand build on past successes in the markets\nwhere PNC\u2019s retail banking presence was\nlimited, such as in the Southeast.

On a\nconsolidated basis, the revenue from these\nother services is included in net interest\nincome, corporate service fees and other\nnoninterest income. From a business\nperspective, the majority of the revenue and\nexpense related to these services is reflected\nin the Corporate & Institutional Banking\nsegment results and the remainder is reflected\nin the results of other businesses.

A discussion of the consolidated\nrevenue from these services follows.\n\nThe Treasury Management business provides\ncorporations with cash and investment\nmanagement services, receivables and\ndisbursement management services, funds\ntransfer services, international payment\nservices and access to online/mobile\ninformation management and reporting services.\nWithin Treasury Management, PNC Global\nTransfers (formerly BBVA Transfer Services,\nInc.) provides wholesale money transfer\nprocessing capabilities between the U.S. and\nMexico and other countries primarily in\nCentral America and South America. Treasury\nmanagement revenue is reported in noninterest\nincome and net interest income. Noninterest\nincome includes treasury management product\nrevenue less earnings credits provided to\ncustomers on compensating deposit balances\nused to pay for products and services. Net\ninterest income primarily includes revenue\nfrom all treasury management customer deposit\nbalances. Compared with the first nine months\nof 2020, treasury management revenue increased\ndue to higher deposit balances and higher\nnoninterest income, partially offset by\nnarrower interest rate spreads on the value of\ndeposits.\n\nCapital markets-related products and services\ninclude foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed\nincome, securities underwriting, loan\nsyndications, mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory and equity capital markets advisory\nrelated services. The increase in capital\nmarkets-related revenue in the comparison was\nmostly driven by higher merger and acquisition\nadvisory fees as well as higher equity capital\nmarket advisory fees, partially offset by\nlower customer-related derivative fees.\n\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include\nrevenue derived from commercial mortgage\nservicing (both net interest income and\nnoninterest income) and revenue derived from\ncommercial mortgage loans held for sale and\nrelated hedges. Total revenue from commercial\nmortgage banking activities increased in the\ncomparison primarily due to higher commercial\nmortgage servicing income, partially offset by\nlower revenue from commercial mortgage loans\nheld for sale.\n\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n                                              \n  Asset Management Group                      \n                                              \nAsset Management Group is focused on being a\npremier bank-held individual and institutional\nasset manager in each of the markets it\nserves.

                10-Q 19\nAsset Management Group earnings in the first\nnine months of 2021 increased $127 million\ncompared with the same period in 2020 driven\nby higher revenue and lower provision for\ncredit losses. Results for the first nine\nmonths of 2021 reflect the benefit of BBVA's\nbusiness operations since the acquisition\nclosed in June 2021.\n\nNet interest income increased due to growth in\naverage loan and deposit balances, reflecting\nthe BBVA acquisition and wider interest rate\nspreads on loans. This was partially offset by\nnarrower interest rate spreads on deposits.\n\nThe increase in noninterest income was\nprimarily attributable to increases in the\naverage equity markets and the benefit of\nBBVA.\n\nNoninterest expense increased due to the\nimpact of BBVA operations, partially offset by\nintangible asset amortization run-off.\n\nProvision for credit losses in the first nine\nmonths of 2021 was driven by the additional\nprovision for credit losses related to the\nBBVA acquisition, partially offset by\nimprovements in credit quality and\nmacroeconomic factors.\n\nDiscretionary client assets under management\nincreased in comparison to the prior year\nprimarily due to the higher equity markets as\nof September 30, 2021.\n\nThe Asset Management Group strives to be the\nleading relationship-based provider of\ninvestment, planning, credit and cash\nmanagement solutions and fiduciary services to\nwealthy individuals and institutions by\nproactively delivering value-added ideas,\nsolutions and exceptional service.\n\nWith the inclusion of BBVA, PNC Private Bank\nhas approximately 100 offices operating in\neight out of the ten most affluent states in\nthe U.S. with a majority co-located with\nretail banking branches.

Prior to\nclosing, PNC\u2019s Independent Risk Management\ngroup evaluated and updated the frameworks,\npolicies and procedures of the acquired BBVA\nentities as necessary. The updates were made\nto align the acquired BBVA entities with PNC\u2019s\nrisk appetite and connected the elements of\ntheir respective risk governance and reporting\ninto PNC\u2019s existing enterprise risk framework.\nConnecting the existing BBVA risk governance\nand reporting framework into PNC\u2019s existing\nenterprise risk framework allowed separate\nrisk profiles, governance, and reporting for\nPNC Bank and the acquired BBVA entities during\nthe period from acquisition through\nconversion, while also providing the ability\nto consolidate into one enterprise risk\nprofile that was communicated through the\nestablished risk governance and reporting for\nPNC. Upon the merger of BBVA USA into PNC\nBank, completed on October 8, 2021, the\nupdated BBVA risk governance and reporting\nframework is no longer applicable as all\nacquired BBVA entities are under PNC\u2019s\nframework.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk Management                      \n                                              \nCredit risk represents the possibility that a\ncustomer, counterparty or issuer may not\nperform in accordance with contractual terms.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business and results from extending\ncredit to customers, purchasing securities,\nand entering into financial derivative\ntransactions and certain guarantee contracts.\nCredit risk is one of our most significant\nrisks.

This two-\ndimensional credit risk rating methodology\nprovides granularity in the risk monitoring\nprocess and is updated on an ongoing basis\nthrough our credit risk management processes.\nIn addition to monitoring the level of credit\nrisk, we also monitor concentrations of credit\nrisk pertaining to both specific industries\nand geography that may exist in our portfolio.\nOur commercial and industrial portfolio is\nwell-diversified as shown in the following\ntable which provides a breakout by industry\nclassification (classified based on the\nNAICS).\n\nTable 15: Commercial and Industrial Loans by\nIndustry\n                                              \n           Se\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           30,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  22\u2026     15  %    $  20\u2026     16  %  \n  R\u2026       22\u2026     15          20\u2026     15     \n  t\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       20\u2026     14          19\u2026     15     \n  p\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026       18\u2026     12          14\u2026     11     \n  s\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026       14\u2026     10          13\u2026     10     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       10\u2026      7          8,\u2026      7     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       7,\u2026      5          7,\u2026      5     \n  w\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       36\u2026     22          27\u2026     21     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $  15\u2026    100  %    $  13\u2026    100  %  \n  i\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n                                              \n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real\nestate and construction industries.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 21\nThe increase in commercial and industrial\nloans compared to December 31, 2020 primarily\nreflects the acquisition of BBVA.

Comparable amounts\nas of December 31, 2020 were $17.3 billion,\n$6.3 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.\n\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our\ncommercial real estate loans similar to\ncommercial and industrial loans by analyzing\nPD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated\nwith these types of credit activities tend to\nbe correlated to the loan structure,\ncollateral location, project progress and\nbusiness environment. These attributes are\nalso monitored and utilized in assessing\ncredit risk.

We continue\nto carefully monitor and manage these loans,\nand while we have not yet experienced material\ncharge-offs in these industries, we believe\nuncertainty relative to the timing and level\nof long-term recovery remains high.\n\nIn our non-real estate related category we\nhave $12.3 billion in loans outstanding, $1.7\nbillion of which are funded through the PPP\nand guaranteed by the SBA. Nonperforming loans\nin these industries totaled $0.2 billion, or\n2% of total loans outstanding in the non-real\nestate related category, while criticized\nassets totaled $1.8 billion at September 30,\n2021 with the greatest stress seen in the\nleisure recreation and leisure travel sectors.\n\nWithin the real estate related category we\nhave $8.9 billion in loans outstanding, which\nincludes real estate projects of $6.6 billion\nand unsecured real estate of $2.3 billion.\nNonperforming loans in these industries\ntotaled $0.2 billion at September 30, 2021, or\n2% of total loans outstanding in the\ncommercial real estate related category. In\nthis category, while loan performance has not\nmaterially deteriorated, these industries\ncontinue to face headwinds that have resulted\nin a slower recovery compared with the pace of\nthe overall economy.\n\nOil and Gas Loan Portfolio\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, our outstanding\nloans in the oil and gas sector totaled $3.9\nbillion, or 1% of total loans. This portfolio\ncomprised approximately $1.4 billion in the\nmidstream and downstream sectors, $1.0 billion\nof oil services companies and $1.5 billion\nrelated to exploration and production\ncompanies. Of the oil services category,\napproximately $0.3 billion is not asset-based\nor investment grade. Nonperforming loans in\nthe oil and gas sector as of September 30,\n2021 totaled $0.2 billion, or 5% of total\nloans outstanding in this sector. Additional\nunfunded loan commitments for the oil and gas\nportfolio totaled $10.1 billion at September\n30, 2021.\n\nConsumer\n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nResidential real estate loans primarily\nconsisted of residential mortgage loans at\nboth September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nWe obtain loan attributes at origination,\nincluding original FICO scores and LTVs, and\nwe update these and other credit metrics at\nleast quarterly. We track borrower performance\nmonthly. We also segment the mortgage\nportfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , nonconforming, conforming).

We also originate\nnonconforming residential mortgage loans that\ndo not meet agency standards, which we retain\non our balance sheet. Our portfolio of\noriginated nonconforming residential mortgage\nloans totaled $29.9 billion at September 30,\n2021 with 43% located in California.\nComparable amounts at December 31, 2020 were\n$17.9 billion and 41%, respectively.\n\nHome Equity\n\nHome equity loans comprised $15.3 billion of\nprimarily variable-rate home equity lines of\ncredit and $9.2 billion of closed-end home\nequity installment loans at September 30,\n2021. Comparable amounts were $12.6 billion\nand $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nWe track borrower performance of this\nportfolio monthly similarly to residential\nreal estate loans. We also segment the\npopulation into pools based on product type (\ne.g. , home equity loans, brokered home equity\nloans, home equity lines of credit, brokered\nhome equity lines of credit) and track the\nhistorical performance of any related mortgage\nloans regardless of whether we hold the lien.\nThis information is used for internal\nreporting and risk management. As part of our\noverall risk analysis and monitoring, we also\nsegment the portfolio based upon the loan\ndelinquency, nonperforming status,\nmodification and bankruptcy status, FICO\nscores, LTV, lien position and geographic\nconcentration.\n\nNewly originated loans over the last twelve\nmonths had a weighted-average LTV on\noriginations of 66% and a weighted-average\nFICO score of 782.\n\nThe credit performance of the majority of the\nhome equity portfolio where we hold the first\nlien position is superior to the portion of\nthe portfolio where we hold the second lien\nposition, but do not hold the first lien. Lien\nposition information is generally determined\nat the time of origination and monitored on an\nongoing basis for risk management purposes. We\nuse an industry-leading third-party service\nprovider to obtain updated loan information,\nincluding lien and collateral data that is\naggregated from public and private sources.\n\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nThe following table presents our home equity\nloans by geography and lien type:\n\nTable 18: Home Equity Loans by Geography and\nby Lien Type\n                                              \n           Se\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           30,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  D\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Am\u2026     of          Am\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  G\u2026                                          \n  (\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  5,\u2026     21  %    $  5,\u2026     23  %  \n  N\u2026       3,\u2026     13          3,\u2026     14     \n  J\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       2,\u2026     10          2,\u2026     11     \n  F\u2026       1,\u2026      7          1,\u2026      6     \n  M\u2026       1,\u2026      5          1,\u2026      6     \n  M\u2026       1,\u2026      5          1,\u2026      6     \n  I\u2026       1,\u2026      5          1,\u2026      6     \n  T\u2026       1,\u2026      4            7            \n  N\u2026       937      4          1,\u2026      4     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  K\u2026       800      3          922      4     \n  O\u2026       5,\u2026     23          4,\u2026     20     \n  T\u2026                                          \n  h\u2026    $  24\u2026    100  %    $  24\u2026    100  %  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  t\u2026                                          \n  1\u2026               61  %               63  %  \n  l\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026               39                  37     \n  l\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026              100  %              100  %  \n                                              \n(a) Presented in descending order based on\nloan balances at September 30, 2021.\n\nAutomobile\n\nAuto loans comprised $16.0 billion in the\nindirect auto portfolio and $1.3 billion in\nthe direct auto portfolio as of September 30,\n2021.

of\nnonperforming assets attributable to BBVA.\nChanges in this acquired portfolio for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2021 are\nreflected in the appropriate category based on\nactivity.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, approximately 99% of\ntotal nonperforming loans were secured by\ncollateral which lessened reserve requirements\nand is expected to reduce credit losses.\n\nWithin consumer nonperforming loans,\nresidential real estate TDRs comprised 44% of\ntotal residential real estate nonperforming\nloans while home equity TDRs comprised 38% of\nhome equity nonperforming loans at September\n30, 2021. Comparable amounts at December 31,\n2020 were 47% and 41%, respectively. TDRs\ngenerally remain in nonperforming status until\na borrower has made at least six consecutive\nmonths of both principal and interest payments\nunder the modified terms or ultimate\nresolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have\nbeen discharged from personal liability\nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not\nformally reaffirmed their loan obligations to\nus and loans to borrowers not currently\nobligated to make both principal and interest\npayments under the restructured terms are not\nreturned to accrual status. Loans that have\nbeen restructured for COVID-19 related\nhardships and meet certain criteria under the\nCARES Act are not identified as TDRs.

Measurement of delinquency status\nis based on the contractual terms of each\nloan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due\nin terms of payment are considered delinquent.\nLoan delinquencies include government insured\nor guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts\nexclude loans held for sale.\n\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in\nApril 2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020\ndelinquency status of loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships aligns with the\nrules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020 based on the contractual\nterms of the loan, even where borrowers may\nnot be making payments on their loans during\nthe modification period. Loan modifications\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate or the principal balance of a\nloan do not qualify for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act or the interagency guidance.

As such, they are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan\nModifications\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been\nrestructured in a manner that grants a\nconcession to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. TDRs result from our\nloss mitigation activities and include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness,\npostponement/reduction of scheduled\namortization and extensions, which are\nintended to minimize economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of\ncollateral. Additionally, TDRs also result\nfrom court-imposed concessions (e.g., a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is\ndischarged from personal liability to us and a\ncourt approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment\nplan). Loans to borrowers experiencing\nCOVID-19 related hardships that have been\nrestructured but that meet certain criteria\nunder the CARES Act are not categorized as\nTDRs.

We continued to see a reduction in\nthe number of customers in active assistance\nfrom the peak in the summer of 2020, which led\nto additional declines in loans under\nmodification that present credit risk to PNC\nat September 30, 2021.\n\nThe impact of these modifications was\nconsidered within the quarterly reserve\ndetermination. See the Allowance for Credit\nLosses discussion within the Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Judgments section of\nthis Financial Review for additional\ninformation. Refer to the Loan Delinquencies\ndiscussion in this Credit Risk Management\nsection for information on how these hardship\nrelated loan modifications are reported from a\ndelinquency perspective as of September 30,\n2021.\n\nUnder the CARES Act, loan modifications\nmeeting certain criteria qualify the loan for\nrelief from TDR treatment. Loans that do not\nmeet the criteria for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act may also be evaluated under\ninteragency guidance. For additional\ninformation on this criteria, see the Loan\nModifications discussion in the Credit Risk\nManagement section within Item 7 of our 2020\nForm 10-K.\n\nConsumer Loan Modifications Under Hardship\nRelief Programs\n\nOur consumer loan modification programs are\nbeing granted in response to customer\nhardships that extended beyond the initial\nrelief period.

primarily related to charge-offs\nattributable to BBVA, which were largely the\nresult of required purchase accounting\ntreatment for the acquisition. This increase\nwas more than offset by declines in consumer\nnet-charge-offs, driven primarily by decreases\nin automobile and credit card due to the\ncontinued favorable impact of government\nstimulus programs benefiting consumers, as\nwell as the increase in automobile collateral\nvalues which has limited our losses in the\nauto portfolio.\n\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K and Note 4 Loans\nand Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in\nItem 1 of this Report for additional\ninformation.\n                                              \n   Liquidity and Capital Management           \n                                              \nLiquidity risk, including our liquidity\nmonitoring measures and tools, is described in\nfurther detail in the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement section of our 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nOne of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by\nreference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum\nliquidity requirement designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations maintain an\nadequate level of liquidity to meet net\nliquidity needs over the course of a\nhypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR\nis calculated by dividing the amount of an\ninstitution\u2019s HQLA, as calculated in\naccordance with the LCR rules, by its\nestimated, weighted net cash outflows, with\nnet cash outflows determined by applying the\nassumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The\nresulting quotient is expressed as a\npercentage. Effective January 1, 2020, PNC and\nPNC Bank, as Category III institutions under\nthe Tailoring Rules, were subject to a reduced\nLCR requirement, with each company's net\noutflows reduced by 15%,\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 31\nthereby reducing the amount of HQLA each\ninstitution must hold to meet the LCR minimum\nrequirement. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC\nBank are required to maintain continues to be\n100%. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR\ndaily, and as of September 30, 2021, the LCR\nfor PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the requirement\nof 100%.\n\nDue to certain transition provisions in the\nLCR rules, BBVA USA was not subject to the LCR\non a standalone basis prior to the merger into\nPNC Bank as the merger was completed prior to\nthe effective date for BBVA USA\u2019s LCR\ncompliance in 2022.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory liquidity requirements and their\npotential impact on us in the Supervision and\nRegulation and Recent Regulatory Developments\nsection of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk\nFactors of our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Sources of Liquidity                        \n                                              \nOur largest source of liquidity on a\nconsolidated basis is the customer deposit\nbase generated by our banking businesses.\nThese deposits provide relatively stable and\nlow-cost funding. Total deposits increased to\n$448.9 billion at September 30, 2021 from\n$365.3 billion at December 31, 2020, driven by\ngrowth in both noninterest-bearing and\ninterest-bearing deposits primarily due to the\nBBVA acquisition. See the Funding Sources\nportion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nReview section of this Financial Review for\nadditional information related to our\ndeposits. Additionally, certain assets\ndetermined by us to be liquid as well as\nunused borrowing capacity from a number of\nsources are also available to manage our\nliquidity position.\n\nAt September 30, 2021, our liquid assets\nconsisted of cash and due from banks and\nshort-term investments (federal funds sold,\nresale agreements, trading securities and\ninterest-earning deposits with banks) totaling\n$87.0 billion and securities available for\nsale totaling $124.1 billion. The level of\nliquid assets fluctuates over time based on\nmany factors, including market conditions,\nloan and deposit growth and balance sheet\nmanagement activities. Our liquid assets\nincluded $25.2 billion of securities available\nfor sale and trading securities pledged as\ncollateral to secure public and trust\ndeposits, repurchase agreements and for other\npurposes. In addition, $0.1 billion of\nsecurities held to maturity were also pledged\nas collateral for these purposes.\n\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms\nof funding, including long-term debt (senior\nnotes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings)\nand short-term borrowings (securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, commercial paper\nand other short-term borrowings).

At September 30, 2021, PNC Bank had\n$15.9 billion of notes outstanding under this\nprogram of which $10.9 billion were senior\nbank notes and $5.0 billion were subordinated\nbank notes.\n\nAt September 30, 2021, BBVA USA had $2.1\nbillion of notes outstanding, of which $1.3\nbillion were senior bank notes and $0.8\nbillion were subordinated banks notes.\n\nSee Note 16 Subsequent Events for details on\nthe $750 million bank note redemption\nannounced on October 29, 2021.\n\nPNC Bank maintains additional secured\nborrowing capacity with the FHLB and through\nthe Federal Reserve Bank\n\ndiscount window. The Federal Reserve Bank,\nhowever, is not viewed as a primary means of\nfunding our routine business activities,\n\nbut rather as a potential source of liquidity\nin a stressed environment or during a market\ndisruption. At September 30, 2021, our\n\nunused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB\nand the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $95.3\nbillion.\n\n32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0\nbillion of its commercial paper to provide\nadditional liquidity. At September 30, 2021,\nthere were no issuances outstanding under this\nprogram.\n\nAdditionally, PNC Bank may also access funding\nfrom the parent company through deposits\nplaced at the bank, or through issuing senior\nunsecured notes.\n                                              \n  Parent Company Liquidity                    \n                                              \nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the\nbank level, we monitor the parent company\u2019s\nliquidity. The parent company\u2019s contractual\nobligations consist primarily of debt service\nrelated to parent company borrowings and\nfunding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the\nparent company maintains adequate liquidity to\nfund discretionary activities such as paying\ndividends to our shareholders, share\nrepurchases and acquisitions.\n\nAt September 30, 2021, available parent\ncompany liquidity totaled $6.0 billion. Parent\ncompany liquidity is primarily held in\nintercompany cash. Investments with longer\ndurations may also be acquired, and if so, the\nrelated maturities are aligned with scheduled\ncash needs, such as the maturity of parent\ncompany debt obligations.\n\nThe principal source of parent company\nliquidity is the dividends or other capital\ndistributions it receives from PNC Bank, which\nmay be impacted by the following:\n\n\u2022 Bank-level capital needs,\n\n\u2022 Laws and regulations,\n\n\u2022 Corporate policies,\n\n\u2022 Contractual restrictions, and\n\n\u2022 Other factors.\n\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations\non the ability of a bank to pay dividends or\nmake other capital distributions or to extend\ncredit to the parent company or its non-bank\nsubsidiaries. The amount available for\ndividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent\ncompany without prior regulatory approval was\n$3.1 billion at September 30, 2021. See Note\n20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K for further discussion of these\nlimitations. Due to the net earnings\nrestrictions on dividend distributions under\nAlabama law, BBVA USA was not permitted to pay\ndividends any time between the BBVA\nacquisition on June 1, 2021 and the bank\nmerger on October 8, 2021 without regulatory\napproval.\n\nSee Note 16 Subsequent Events for details on\nPNC Bank's return of capital of $3.0 billion\nto the parent company.\n\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other\nsources of parent company liquidity include\ncash and investments, as well as dividends and\nloan repayments from other subsidiaries and\ndividends or distributions from equity\ninvestments. We can also generate liquidity\nfor the parent company and PNC\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries through the issuance of debt and\nequity securities, including certain capital\ninstruments, in public or private markets and\ncommercial paper. The parent company has the\nability to offer up to $5.0 billion of\ncommercial paper to provide additional\nliquidity. At September 30, 2021, there were\nno commercial paper issuances outstanding.\n\nOn August 4, 2021, PNC redeemed all of the\noutstanding senior notes due September 3, 2021\nissued by PNC in the amount of $500 million.\nThe securities had a distribution rate of\n3.250%. The redemption price was equal to\n$1,000 per $1,000 in principal amount, plus\nany accrued and unpaid distributions to the\nredemption date.\n\nOn August 13, 2021, the parent company issued\n$700 million of senior notes with a maturity\ndate of August 13, 2026. Interest is payable\nsemi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of\n1.15% per annum, on August 13 and February 13\nof each year, beginning on February 13, 2022.\n\nParent company senior and subordinated debt\noutstanding totaled $11.4 billion and $10.6\nbillion at September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively.\n                                              \n  Contractual Obligations and Commitments     \n                                              \nWe have contractual obligations representing\nrequired future payments on borrowed funds,\ntime deposits, leases, pension and\npostretirement benefits and purchase\nobligations. See the Liquidity and Capital\nManagement portion of the Risk Management\nsection in our 2020 Form 10-K for more\ninformation on these future cash outflows.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of business\nwe have various commitments outstanding,\ncertain of which are not included on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.

Supplementary leverage ratio is\ncalculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by\nSupplementary leverage exposure, which takes\ninto account the quarterly average of both on\nbalance sheet assets as

assets.\n\nPNC\u2019s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are\ncalculated using the standardized approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted assets. Under the\nstandardized approach for determining credit\nrisk-weighted assets, exposures are generally\nassigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures\nto high volatility commercial real estate,\nnonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and\nequity exposures are generally subject to\nhigher risk weights than other types of\nexposures.\n\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule\npermitting banking organizations to delay the\nestimated impact on regulatory capital\nstemming from implementing CECL. CECL\u2019s\nestimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined\nby the rule, is the change in retained\nearnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the\nchange in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,\nexcluding the initial allowance for PCD loans\nfrom BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at transition.\nPNC elected to adopt this optional transition\nprovision effective as of March 31, 2020. See\nadditional discussion of this rule in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2020\nForm 10-K.\n\nAt September 30, 2021, PNC, PNC Bank and BBVA\nUSA were considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d based\non applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. To qualify as \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d, PNC must have Basel III capital\nratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and 10% for Total risk-based capital,\nand PNC Bank and BBVA USA must have Basel III\ncapital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common\nequity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier\n1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based\ncapital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 35\nFederal banking regulators have stated that\nthey expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a level of regulatory capital\nwell in excess of the regulatory minimum and\nhave required the largest U.S. BHCs, including\nPNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to\nwithstand losses and allow them to meet the\ncredit needs of their customers through\nestimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage\nour capital consistent with these regulatory\nprinciples, and believe that our September 30,\n2021 capital levels were aligned with them.\n\nWe provide additional information regarding\nregulatory capital requirements and some of\ntheir potential impacts on us in the\nSupervision and Regulation section of Item 1\nBusiness, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20\nRegulatory Matters in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management                      \n                                              \nSee the Market Risk Management portion of the\nRisk Management Section in our 2020 Form 10-K\nfor additional discussion regarding market\nrisk.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Management \u2013 Interest Rate      \n  Risk                                        \n                                              \nInterest rate risk results primarily from our\ntraditional banking activities of gathering\ndeposits and extending loans. Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions,\nmovements in interest rates and consumer\npreferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the\ninterest that we pay on liabilities and the\nlevel of our noninterest-bearing funding\nsources. Due to the repricing term mismatches\nand embedded options inherent in certain of\nthese products, changes in market interest\nrates not only affect expected near-term\nearnings, but also the economic values of\nthese assets and liabilities.\n\nOur Asset and Liability Management group\ncentrally manages interest rate risk as\nprescribed in our risk management policies,\nwhich are approved by management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\n\nSensitivity results and market interest rate\nbenchmarks for the third quarter of 2021 and\n2020 follow:\n                                              \n  Table 30: Interest Sensitivity Analysis     \n                                              \n                                              \n                   Third             Third    \n                   Quarter           Quarter  \n                   2021 (a)          2020     \n  Net                                         \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Income                                      \n  Sensit\u2026                                     \n  Simula\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  first                                       \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  follow\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis       4.5  %            4.3  %        \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  Effect                                      \n  on net                                      \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  income                                      \n  in                                          \n  second                                      \n  year                                        \n  from                                        \n  gradual                                     \n  intere\u2026                                     \n  rate                                        \n  change                                      \n  over                                        \n  the                                         \n  preced\u2026                                     \n  12                                          \n  months                                      \n  of:                                         \n  100                                         \n  basis      11.3  %           10.9  %        \n  point                                       \n  increa\u2026                                     \n  Key                                         \n  Period\u2026                                     \n  Intere\u2026                                     \n  Rates                                       \n  One-mo\u2026    0.08  %           0.15  %        \n  LIBOR                                       \n  Three-\u2026    0.13  %           0.23  %        \n  LIBOR                                       \n  Three-\u2026    0.65  %           0.24  %        \n  swap                                        \n                                              \n(a) Results include BBVA USA.\n\nIn addition to measuring the effect on net\ninterest income assuming parallel changes in\ncurrent interest rates, we routinely simulate\nthe effects of a number of nonparallel\ninterest rate environments.

These simulations assume\nthat as assets and liabilities mature, they\nare replaced or repriced at then current\nmarket rates.\n\nThe following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap\nyield curves for the base rate scenario and\neach of the alternate scenarios one year\nforward.\n\nTable 32: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios:\nOne Year Forward\n\nThe third quarter 2021 interest sensitivity\nanalyses indicate that our Consolidated\nBalance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an\nincrease in interest rates and an upward\nsloping interest rate yield curve. We believe\nthat we have the deposit funding base and\nbalance sheet flexibility to adjust, where\nappropriate and permissible, to changing\ninterest rates and market conditions.\n\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors in our\n2020 Form 10-K, the planned discontinuance of\nthe requirement that banks submit rates for\nthe calculation of LIBOR after 2023 presents\nrisks to the financial instruments originated,\nheld or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a\nreference rate. PNC holds instruments and\nservices its instruments and instruments owned\nby others that may be impacted by the likely\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR, including loans,\ninvestments, hedging products, floating-rate\nobligations, and other financial instruments\nthat use LIBOR as a reference rate. The\ntransition from LIBOR as an interest rate\nbenchmark will subject PNC, like other\nfinancial participants, to financial, legal,\noperational, and reputational risks.\n\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the\nassociated risks, PNC has established a cross-\nfunctional governance structure to oversee the\noverall strategy for the transition from LIBOR\nand mitigate risks associated with the\ntransition. A LIBOR impact and risk assessment\nhas been performed, which identified the\nassociated risks across products, systems,\nmodels, and processes. PNC also established an\nenterprise-level program, which is actively\nmonitoring PNC\u2019s overall firm-wide exposure to\nLIBOR and using these results to plan\ntransitional strategies and track progress\nversus these goals. Program workstreams were\nformed by Line of Business to ensure\naccountability and alignment with the\nappropriate operational, technology, and\ncustomer-facing stakeholders, while\nestablishing a centralized Program Management\nOffice to ensure consistency in execution and\ncommunication. Project plans and established\nmilestones have been developed and have\ncontinued to evolve and be refined in line\nwith industry developments and internal\ndecisions and progress. PNC is also involved\nin industry discussions, preparing milestones\nfor readiness and assessing progress against\nthose milestones, along with developing and\ndelivering on internal and external LIBOR\ncessation communication plans.\n\nKey efforts in 2020 and the first nine months\nof 2021 included:\n\n\u2022 Enhancing fallback language in new contracts\nand reviewing existing legal\ncontracts/agreements to assess fallback\nlanguage impacts,\n\n\u2022 Making preparations for internal operational\nreadiness,\n\n\u2022 Making necessary enhancements to PNC's\ninfrastructure, including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes,\n\n\u2022 Developing and delivering on internal and\nexternal LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n\n\u2022 Engaging with PNC clients, industry working\ngroups and regulators, and\n\n\u2022 Monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments.\n\nPNC also has been an active participant in\nefforts with the Federal Reserve and other\nregulatory agencies to explore the potential\nneed for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to\nSOFR for use in commercial loans. Those\nefforts led to the formation of the Credit\nSensitivity\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 37\nGroup, which has held a series of workshops to\nassess how a credit-sensitive rate or add-on\nto SOFR might be constructed and discuss\nassociated implementation issues.\n\nIn late 2020, PNC began offering conforming\nadjustable rate mortgages using SOFR instead\nof USD LIBOR in line with Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac requirements. In the second\nquarter of 2021, PNC began offering\nnonconforming adjustable rate mortgages using\nSOFR and private student loans using Prime.\nAlternative rates including, but not limited\nto, the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index\nand SOFR are currently being offered to our\ncorporate and commercial customers. LIBOR will\ncease to be offered for new loans by year end\n2021. PNC has provided regular updates to\nFederal Reserve, OCC and Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation examination staff\nregarding its LIBOR cessation and transition\nplans.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013                   \n   Customer-Related Trading Risk              \n                                              \nWe engage in fixed income securities,\nderivatives and foreign exchange transactions\nto support our customers\u2019 investing and\nhedging activities.

The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower interest rate\nderivative client sales revenues partially\noffset by improved foreign exchange client\nsales revenues. For the quarterly period,\ncustomer-related trading revenue was $99\nmillion for the third quarter of 2021,\ncompared to $108 million in 2020. The decrease\nwas primarily due to changes in the credit\nvaluation for customer-related derivatives\nactivities partially offset by improved\nforeign exchange client revenues.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management \u2013 Equity And        \n   Other Investment Risk                      \n                                              \nEquity investment risk is the risk of\npotential losses associated with investing in\nboth private and public equity markets.

The estimated value does not\nrepresent fair value of the Visa B common\nshares given the share\u2019s limited\ntransferability and the lack of observable\ntransactions in the marketplace.\n\nWe also have certain other equity investments,\nthe majority of which represent investments in\naffiliated and non-affiliated funds with both\ntraditional and alternative investment\nstrategies. Net gains related to these\ninvestments were $44 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and were not\nsignificant for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n                                              \n  Financial Derivatives                       \n                                              \nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as\npart of the overall asset and liability risk\nmanagement process to help manage exposure to\nmarket (primarily interest rate) and credit\nrisk inherent in our business activities. We\nalso enter into derivatives with customers to\nfacilitate their risk management activities.\n\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying\ndegrees, market and credit risk.

Therefore, cash\nrequirements and exposure to credit risk are\nsignificantly less than the notional amount on\nthese instruments.\n\nFurther information on our financial\nderivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting\nPolicies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16\nFinancial Derivatives in our Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in our 2020\nForm 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note\n12 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of\nthis Report.\n\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are\naddressed through the use of financial\nderivatives, and such instruments may be\nineffective for their intended purposes due to\nunanticipated market changes, among other\nreasons.\n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  ECENT                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  R                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EGULATORY                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  D                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  EVELOPMENTS                                 \n                                              \nBBVA USA Merger\n\nOn October 8, 2021 and following regulatory\napproval from the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nPNC consummated the merger of its U.S. state\nmember bank subsidiary, BBVA USA, Birmingham,\nAlabama, with and into PNC Bank, with PNC Bank\nremaining as the surviving bank. The\nregulatory approval process also included\napprovals from the banking departments of the\nstates of Alabama and Texas. With completion\nof the merger and conversion of BBVA USA\nbranches to PNC Bank branches, PNC Bank has\nadded branches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona,\nCalifornia, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico.\nThe merger of the two banks did not affect PNC\nor PNC Bank\u2019s classification as Category III\ninstitutions for purposes of federal bank\nregulations.\n\nOther Developments\n\nIn September 2021, the OCC issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking to rescind its June 2020\nCRA rule. The OCC's June 2020 rule made\nsignificant changes to the OCC\u2019s regulations\nimplementing the CRA for national banks, like\nPNC Bank, and replaced the previous CRA rule\njointly issued with the Federal Reserve and\nthe FDIC (1995 rule). The June 2020 rule would\nhave required significant changes to PNC\nBank\u2019s CRA framework. The OCC is proposing to\nreplace its June 2020 rule, including\nprovisions of the rule that were effective\nOctober 1, 2020, with rules largely based on\nthe 1995 rule subject to a transition for\ncertain aspects of the June 2020 rule. The\nproposal would facilitate the OCC\u2019s ongoing\nwork with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to\nmodernize the regulations implementing the CRA\nand create consistent rules for all insured\ndepository institutions. Comments on the\nproposal are due October 29, 2021.\n\nIn September 2021, the CFPB issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking to implement the small\nbusiness lending data collection requirements\nset forth in section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank\nAct. Section 1071 amended the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act to require financial\ninstitutions to collect and report to the CFPB\ndata regarding certain small business credit\napplications. Under the proposal, financial\ninstitutions that meet small business credit\ntransaction thresholds, like PNC Bank, would\nbe required to collect and report\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 39\nsignificant amounts of data regarding\napplications for small business credit,\nincluding on the race, sex and ethnicity of\nthe principal owners of the business, among\nother requirements. The CFPB has proposed that\nany final rule, when issued, would be\neffective 90 days after publication in the\nFederal Register, with compliance mandated 18\nmonths after publication.

Certain of\nthese policies require us to make estimates or\neconomic assumptions that may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions, and such\nvariations may significantly affect our\nreported results and financial position for\nthe period or in future periods. The policies\nand judgments related to residential and\ncommercial MSRs and fair value measurements\nare described in Critical Accounting Estimates\nand Judgments in Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K.\nFor additional information on fair value\nmeasurements of assets and liabilities assumed\nin the BBVA acquisition, see Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity in the\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Report. The following details\nthe critical estimates and judgments around\nthe ACL.\n                                              \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                 \n                                              \nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe\nto be appropriate as of the balance sheet date\nto absorb expected credit losses on our\nexisting investment securities, loans,\nequipment finance leases, other financial\nassets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments, for the remaining contractual\nterm of the assets or exposures, taking into\nconsideration expected prepayments. Our\ndetermination of the ACL is based on\nhistorical loss and performance experience,\nwhich is captured through PD, as well as\ncurrent borrower characteristics including\ncollateral type and quality, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future conditions and other\nrelevant factors. We use methods sensitive to\nchanges in economic conditions, to interpret\nthese factors to estimate expected credit\nlosses. We evaluate and, when appropriate,\nenhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate ACL on an\nongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to\nreflect in the ACL our best estimate of\namounts that we do not expect to collect\nbecause of, among other things, idiosyncratic\nrisk factors, changes in economic conditions\nthat may not be reflected in forecasted\nresults, or other potential methodology\nlimitations. The major drivers of ACL\nestimates include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Current economic conditions and borrower\nquality: Our forecast of expected losses\ndepends on economic conditions and\n\nportfolio quality as of the estimation date.\nAs current economic conditions evolve,\nforecasted losses could be materially\n\naffected.\n\n\u2022 Scenario weights and design: Our loss\nestimates are sensitive to the shape,\ndirection and rate of change of macroeconomic\nforecasts and thus vary significantly between\nupside and downside scenarios. Change to\nprobability weights assigned to these\nscenarios and timing of peak business cycles\nreflected by the scenarios could materially\naffect our loss estimates.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to\nportfolio volume and mix could materially\naffect our estimates, as CECL reserves\n\nwould be recognized upon origination or\nacquisition.\n\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related\ncommitments within the scope of the CECL\nstandard, the applicable ACL is composed of\none or a combination of the following\ncomponents: (i) collectively assessed or\npooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed\nreserves, and\n\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our\nmethodologies and key assumptions for each of\nthese components are discussed in Note 1\n\nAccounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Reasonable and Supportable Economic         \n  Forecast                                    \n                                              \nUnder CECL, we are required to consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts in\nestimating expected credit losses. For this\npurpose,\n\nwe have established a framework which includes\na three year forecast period and the use of\nfour economic scenarios with associated\nprobability weights, which in combination\ncreate a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over our reasonable and supportable\nforecast period. Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period\nare sensitive to the shape and severity of the\nscenarios used and weights assigned to them.\n\nTo generate the four economic forecast\nscenarios we use a combination of quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, other measures of\neconomic activity and forward-looking expert\njudgment to forecast the distribution of\neconomic outcomes over the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period. Each scenario is\nthen given an associated probability (weight)\nin order to represent our current expectation\nwithin that distribution over the forecast\nperiod. This process is informed by current\neconomic conditions, expected business cycle\nevolution and the expert judgment of PNC\u2019s\nRAC. This approach seeks to provide a\nreasonable representation of the forecast of\nexpected economic outcomes and is used to\nestimate expected credit losses across a\nvariety of loans and securities. Each quarter\nthe scenarios are presented for approval to\nPNC\u2019s RAC and the committee determines and\napproves CECL scenarios' weights for use for\nthe current reporting period.\n\nThe s cenarios used for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 reflect an improved near-\nterm economic outlook compared to the\nscenarios used for the period ended December\n31, 2020. The overall improvement in the\ncomparison was driven largely by\n\n40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nimprovements in both the outlook for consumer\nspending and the labor market, along with the\nimpact from continued vaccine distribution,\nwhile also considering the lingering effects\nof COVID-19 that slowed the momentum of\neconomic recovery in recent months, as the\nDelta variant continued to drive increased\nCOVID-19 cases throughout the U.S. and abroad.\n\nWe used a number of economic variables in our\nscenarios, with the most significant drivers\nbeing Real GDP and unemployment rate measures.\nUsing the weighted-average of our four\neconomic forecast scenarios, we estimated\nthat:\n\n\u2022 Real GDP grows 5.4% in 2021, ending the year\n3.1% above pre-recession levels. Annual growth\ncontinues but slows to 2.9% and 1.9% in 2022\nand 2023, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Unemployment rates reflect continued\nrecovery in the labor market in 2021, with the\nunemployment rate falling to 5.3% by the end\nof the year. Employment gains were estimated\nto continue through the forecast period with\nthe unemployment rate reaching 4.8% and 4.3%\nby the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\nOne of the scenarios included in our weighted-\naverage is our baseline prediction of the most\nlikely economic outcome. This scenario\nincludes estimated Real GDP growing to 5.8% in\n2021 and ending the year 3.4% above its pre-\nrecession peak levels, with annual growth\nslowing to 3.2% and 1.6% in 2022 and 2023,\nrespectively. Unemployment rates in this most\nlikely scenario reach 5.0% by the end of 2021,\n4.3% by the end of 2022 and 3.9% by the end of\n2023. See our Business Outlook and the\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking\nInformation in this Financial Review for\nadditional discussion on our baseline\nprediction of the most likely economic\noutcome.\n\nThough the outlook of near-term growth is less\noptimistic than it was last quarter due to the\nemergence of the Delta COVID-19 variant and\ncontinued supply chain challenges, the economy\nhas seen significant recovery from the onset\nof the pandemic. National macroeconomic\nindicators, forecasts and performance\nexpectations have all steadily improved,\nhelping to lower overall loss expectations.\nThese improvements have been reflected in the\nreserve releases through the first nine months\nof 2021. However, for certain portions of our\ncommercial and consumer portfolios,\nconsiderable uncertainty remains regarding\nlifetime losses. For commercial borrowers,\nthere are still lingering concerns around\nindustries that have been affected by COVID-19\nrelated restrictions and emerging secular\nchanges. For these industries, where\nunrestricted commerce has recently returned,\nthe recovery will lag the broader economy.\nWhere restrictions persist and/or secular\nchanges have emerged, the impact and eventual\nlevel of recovery are less certain. For\nconsumer borrowers, payment behavior upon\nexpiration of government stimulus, including\nrecently expired enhanced unemployment\nbenefits is still difficult to predict. As\nsuch, for both our commercial and consumer\nloan portfolios, PNC identified and performed\nsignificant analysis around these segments to\nensure our reserves are adequate in the\ncurrent economic environment. We believe the\neconomic scenarios have effectively provided\nsufficient variation to capture probable\nrecovery paths.

We will\ncontinue to evaluate the effectiveness of\ninternal controls over financial reporting\npost-integration of BBVA, including BBVA USA,\nwith that of PNC and PNC Bank and will make\nchanges to our internal control framework, as\nnecessary. The acquisition of BBVA contributed\n$86.6 billion of assets, or 16% of our total\nassets, to our balance sheet at September 30,\n2021. The BBVA acquisition also contributed\n$737 million of revenue, or 14% of total\nrevenue, for the three months ended September\n30, 2021 and $1.1 billion of revenue, or 7% of\ntotal revenue, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\n42 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT R EGARDING F ORWARD -L\nOOKING I NFORMATION\n\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may\nfrom time to time make other statements,\nregarding our outlook for earnings, revenues,\nexpenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity\nlevels and ratios, asset levels, asset\nquality, financial position, and other matters\nregarding or affecting us and our future\nbusiness and operations that are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nForward-looking statements are typically\nidentified by words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201clook,\u201d\n\u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d\n\u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other\nsimilar words and expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are necessarily\nsubject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, which change over time. Future\nevents or circumstances may change our outlook\nand may also affect the nature of the\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties to which\nour forward-looking statements are subject.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of\nthe date made. We do not assume any duty and\ndo not undertake any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or\nfuture events could differ, possibly\nmaterially, from those anticipated in forward-\nlooking statements, as well as from historical\nperformance. As a result, we caution against\nplacing undue reliance on any forward-looking\nstatements.\n\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to\nthe following principal risks and\nuncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses, financial results and\nbalance sheet values are affected by business\nand economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2013 Changes in interest rates and valuations in\ndebt, equity and other financial markets,\n\n\u2013 Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial\nmarkets,\n\n\u2013 Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nTreasury and other government agencies,\nincluding those that impact money supply,\nmarket interest rates and inflation,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customer behavior due to changing\nbusiness and economic conditions or\nlegislative or regulatory initiatives,\n\n\u2013 Changes in customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and other\ncounterparties\u2019 performance and\ncreditworthiness,\n\n\u2013 Impacts of tariffs and other trade policies\nof the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n\n\u2013 The length and extent of the economic\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\n\u2013 The impact of the results of the 2020 U.S.\nelections, including on the regulatory\nlandscape, capital markets, tax policy,\ninfrastructure spending and social programs,\nand\n\n\u2013 Commodity price volatility.\n\n\u2022 Our forward-looking financial statements are\nsubject to the risk that economic and\nfinancial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are\ncurrently expecting and do not take into\naccount potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on\nour view that:\n\n\u2013 The U.S. economy is in an economic recovery,\nfollowing a very severe but very short\neconomic contraction in the first half of 2020\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health\nmeasures to contain it.\n\n\u2013 The Delta COVID-19 variant and supply chain\ndifficulties have been drags on economic\ngrowth in the second half of 2021, although\nthe economy continues to expand. Growth will\npick up at the end of 2021 as the impact of\nthe Delta variant fades and supply chains\nnormalize and will remain solid into 2022.\nEmployment in September 2021 was still down by\nalmost 5 million from before the pandemic; PNC\nexpects employment to return to its pre-\npandemic level in mid-2022.\n\n\u2013 Compared to the spring of 2020 (when prices\nwere falling), inflation accelerated in\nmid-2021 due to strong demand in specific\nsegments and supply chain disruptions.\nInflation has started to slow on a month-over-\nmonth basis but will remain elevated in the\nnear term.\n\n\u2013 PNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds\nrate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25 %\nuntil late 2022.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s ability to take certain capital\nactions, including returning capital to\nshareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or\nexceeding a stress capital buffer established\nby the Federal Reserve Board in connection\nwith the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process.\n\n\u2022 PNC\u2019s regulatory capital ratios in the\nfuture will depend on, among other things, the\ncompany\u2019s financial performance, the scope and\nterms of final capital regulations then in\neffect and management actions affecting the\ncomposition of PNC\u2019s balance sheet. In\naddition, PNC\u2019s ability to determine, evaluate\nand forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to\ntake actions (such as capital distributions)\nbased on actual or forecasted capital ratios,\nwill be dependent at least in part on the\ndevelopment, validation and regulatory review\nof related models.\n\n\u2022 Legal and regulatory developments could have\nan impact on our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, financial condition, results of\noperations, competitive position, reputation,\nor pursuit of attractive acquisition\nopportunities. Reputational impacts could\naffect matters such as business generation and\nretention, liquidity, funding, and ability to\nattract and retain management. These\ndevelopments could include:\n\n\u2013 Changes to laws and regulations, including\nchanges affecting oversight of the financial\nservices industry, consumer protection, bank\ncapital and liquidity standards, pension,\nbankruptcy and other industry aspects, and\nchanges in accounting policies and principles.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 43\n\u2013 Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings\nor other claims and regulatory and other\ngovernmental investigations or other\ninquiries. These matters may result in\nmonetary judgments or settlements or other\nremedies, including fines, penalties,\nrestitution or alterations in our business\npractices, and in additional expenses and\ncollateral costs, and may cause reputational\nharm to PNC.\n\n\u2013 Results of the regulatory examination and\nsupervision process, including our failure to\nsatisfy requirements of agreements with\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n\u2013 Impact on business and operating results of\nany costs associated with obtaining rights in\nintellectual property claimed by others and of\nadequacy of our intellectual property\nprotection in general.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results are affected\nby our ability to identify and effectively\nmanage risks inherent in our businesses,\nincluding, where appropriate, through\neffective use of systems and controls, third-\nparty insurance, derivatives, and capital\nmanagement techniques, and to meet evolving\nregulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n\n\u2022 Our acquisition of BBVA presents us with\nrisks and uncertainties related to the\nintegration of the acquired business into PNC\nincluding:\n\n\u2013 The business of BBVA going forward may not\nperform as we project or in a manner\nconsistent with historical performance. As a\nresult, the anticipated benefits, including\nestimated cost savings, of the transaction may\nbe significantly more difficult or take longer\nto achieve than expected or may not be\nachieved in their entirety as a result of\nunexpected factors or events, including those\nthat are outside of our control.\n\n\u2013 The integration of BBVA, including its U.S.\nbanking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with that of PNC\nand PNC Bank may be more difficult to achieve\nthan anticipated or have unanticipated adverse\nresults. Our ability to integrate BBVA,\nincluding its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA\nUSA, successfully may be adversely affected by\nthe fact that this transaction results in us\nentering several geographic markets where we\ndid not previously have any meaningful\npresence.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the BBVA transaction, we grow\nour business in part through acquisitions and\nnew strategic initiatives. Risks and\nuncertainties include those presented by the\nnature of the business acquired and strategic\ninitiative, including in some cases those\nassociated with our entry into new businesses\nor new geographic or other markets and risks\nresulting from our inexperience in those new\nareas, as well as risks and uncertainties\nrelated to the acquisition transactions\nthemselves, regulatory issues, and the\nintegration of the acquired businesses into\nPNC after closing.\n\n\u2022 Competition can have an impact on customer\nacquisition, growth and retention and on\ncredit spreads and product pricing, which can\naffect market share, deposits and revenues.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to\ntechnological changes can also impact our\nability to respond to customer needs and meet\ncompetitive demands.\n\n\u2022 Business and operating results can also be\naffected by widespread natural and other\ndisasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist\nactivities, system failures, security\nbreaches, cyberattacks or international\nhostilities through impacts on the economy and\nfinancial markets generally or on us or our\ncounterparties specifically.\n\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as\nwell as other factors in our 2020 Form 10-K\nand subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in\nthis Report, including in the Risk Factors and\nRisk Management sections and the Legal\nProceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes\nTo Consolidated Financial Statements in these\nreports.

Our results for\nthe first nine months of 2021 reflect BBVA's\nacquired business operations for the period\nsince the acquisition closed on June 1, 2021.\nOur balance sheet at September 30, 2021\nincludes BBVA's balances. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity for\nadditional information on this acquisition.\n\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. We have\neliminated intercompany accounts and\ntransactions. We have also reclassified\ncertain prior year amounts to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation, which did not\nhave a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn our opinion, the unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements reflect all\nnormal, recurring adjustments needed to\npresent fairly our results for the interim\nperiods. The results of operations for interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the full year\nor any other interim period.\n\nWe have also considered the impact of\nsubsequent events on these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWhen preparing these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements, we have\nassumed that you have read the audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in\nour 2020 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note\n1 Accounting Policies in our 2020 Form 10-K\nfor a detailed description of significant\naccounting policies. These interim\nconsolidated financial statements serve to\nupdate our 2020 Form 10-K and may not include\nall information and Notes necessary to\nconstitute a complete set of financial\nstatements. There have been no significant\nchanges to our accounting policies as\ndisclosed in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial\nstatements using financial information\navailable at the time of preparation, which\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported. Our most\nsignificant estimates pertain to the ACL and\nour fair value measurements, including for the\nBBVA acquisition. Actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates and the differences may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n                                              \n  Accounting                    Financial     \n  Standards      Description    Statement     \n  Update                        Impact        \n                 \u2022                            \n                 Simplifies                   \n                 the                          \n                 accounting                   \n                 for income                   \n                 taxes by                     \n                 eliminating                  \n                 certain                      \n                 exceptions                   \n                 in ASC                       \n                 740,Income                   \n                 Taxes,                       \n                 relating to                  \n                 the                          \n                 approach                     \n                 for                          \n                 intraperiod                  \n                 tax                          \n                 allocation,    \u2022 Adopted     \n                 the            January 1,    \n                 recognition    2021.         \n                 of deferred    \u2022  The        \n                 tax            adoption of   \n                 liabilities    this          \n                 for outside    standard did  \n                 basis          not impact    \n                 differences    our           \n                 and the        consolidated  \n                 methodology    results of    \n                 for            operations    \n                 calculating    or our        \n                 income         consolidated  \n                 taxes in an    financial     \n  Income Tax     interim        position.     \n  Simplifica\u2026    period.

PNC did not acquire the\nfollowing entities as part of the acquisition:\nBBVA Securities, Inc., Propel Venture Partners\nFund I, L.P. and BBVA Processing Services,\nInc. This transaction has been accounted for\nas a business combination. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA were recorded\nat fair value as of the acquisition date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nassets and liabilities from BBVA are subject\nto adjustment for up to one year after the\nclosing date of the acquisition as additional\ninformation becomes available. Valuations\nsubject to adjustment include, but are not\nlimited to, loans, certain deposits, certain\nother assets, customer relationships and the\ncore deposit intangibles.\n\nAs of October 12, 2021, PNC has converted\napproximately 2.6million customers,\n9,000employees and over 600branches across\nsevenstates, merging BBVA USA into PNC Bank.\n\nPNC incurred merger and integration costs of $\n243million and $ 360million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2021, in\nconnection with the transaction.

The prices are adjusted\nas\n\nnecessary to include the embedded servicing\nvalue in the loans and to take into\nconsideration the specific characteristics of\ncertain similar loans.\n\nPersonal installment loans are pooled based on\ndelinquency status, and fair value of\nindividual loans is calculated based on traded\n\nconsumer unsecured loans, dealer research and\nloan level performance characteristics.\n\nAvailable For Sale Securities\n\nAll investment securities from the BBVA\nacquisition were classified within the\navailable for sale portfolio at acquisition.\nFair value\n\nestimates for available for sale securities\nwere determined by third-party pricing\nvendors. The third-party vendors use a variety\nof\n\nmethods when pricing securities that\nincorporate relevant market data to arrive at\nan estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace\n\nwould pay for a security under current market\nconditions. These methods include the use of\nquoted prices for the identical or a similar\n\nsecurity, an alternative market-based approach\nor an income approach, such as a discounted\ncash flow pricing model.\n\nLoans\n\nFair value for loans is based on a discounted\ncash flow methodology that considered credit\nloss and prepayment expectations, market\n\ninterest rates and other market factors, such\nas liquidity, from the perspective of a market\nparticipant. Loan cash flows were generated\n\non an individual loan basis. The PD, LGD,\nexposure at default and prepayment assumptions\nare the key factors driving credit losses\n\nwhich are embedded into the estimated cash\nflows.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 53\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments primarily include LIHTC\ninvestments and preservation fund investments.\nThe fair value of the LIHTC investments\n\nwas estimated based on LIHTC pricing observed\nfor recent transactions in markets where the\nproperties underlying the LIHTC\n\ninvestments from the BBVA acquisition are\nlocated. The fair value of the preservation\ninvestments was estimated based on appraisals\n\nand valuations of the properties in the\ninvestment portfolio using income and market\nprojections.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe fair value of mortgage servicing rights\nfrom the BBVA acquisition is estimated by\nusing a discounted cash flow valuation model\n\nwhich calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows,\ntaking into consideration actual and expected\nmortgage\n\nloan prepayment rates, discount rates,\nservicing costs and other factors which are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\n\nCore Deposit Intangible\n\nThis intangible asset represents the value of\ncertain client deposit relationships. The fair\nvalue was estimated utilizing the cost method.\n\nAppropriate consideration was given to deposit\ncosts including servicing costs, client\nretention and alternative funding source costs\nat\n\nthe time of acquisition. The discount rate\nused was derived taking into account the\nestimated cost of equity, risk-free return\nrate and\n\nrisk premium for the market and specific risk\nrelated to the asset\u2019s cash flows. The core\ndeposit intangible is being amortized over 10\n\nyears using an accelerated depreciation\nmethodology.\n\nDeposits\n\nThe fair values for time deposits were\nestimated by discounting contractual cash\nflows using current market rates for\ninstruments with\n\nsimilar maturities. For deposits with no\ndefined maturity, carrying values approximate\nfair values.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nThe fair values of long-term debt instruments\nwere estimated based on quoted market prices.\nThe following table presents financial results\nof BBVA included in the Consolidated Income\nStatement from the date of acquisition through\nSeptember 30, 2021.\nTable 37: BBVA Financial Results\n                                              \n                           Four months ended  \n  In millions             September 30, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net interest         $                 768  \n  income                                      \n  Noninterest          $                 285  \n  income                                      \n  Net income           $                 378  \n                                              \nThe following table presents unaudited pro\nforma results as if the acquisition of BBVA by\nPNC had occurred on January 1, 2020 and\nincludes the impact of amortizing and\naccreting certain estimated purchase\naccounting adjustments such as intangible\nassets as well as fair value adjustments to\nloans, deposits and long-term debt.

PNC considers a variety of\nfactors in connection with the identification\nof more-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality, including but not limited to\nnonperforming status, delinquency, risk\nratings, TDR classification, FICO scores and\nother qualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. PNC initially measures the\namortized cost of a PCD loan by adding the\nacquisition date estimate of expected credit\nlosses to the loan's purchase price. The\ninitial ACL for PCD loans of $ 1.1billion was\nestablished through an adjustment to the BBVA\nloan balance and related purchase accounting\nmark.

and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nThese amounts are included in Other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(b) Amortized cost is presented net of\nallowance of $ 130million and $ 79million for\nsecurities available for sale at September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(c) Credit ratings represent a primary credit\nquality indicator used to monitor and manage\ncredit risk. 84% and 85% of our securities\nheld to maturity were rated AAA/AA at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nThe fair value of investment securities is\nimpacted by interest rates, credit spreads,\nmarket volatility and liquidity conditions.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at\nfair value with net unrealized gains and\nlosses included in Shareholders\u2019 equity as\nAOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized\ngains and losses are determined by taking the\ndifference between the fair value of a\nsecurity and its amortized cost, net of any\nallowance. Securities held to maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost less any allowance.\nInvestment securities at September 30, 2021\nincluded $ 2.4billion of net unsettled\npurchases which represent non-cash investing\nactivity, and accordingly, are not reflected\non the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe comparable amount for September 30, 2020\nwas $ 0.7billion.\n\nWe maintain the allowance for investment\nsecurities at levels that we believe to be\nappropriate as of the balance sheet date based\non estimation of expected credit losses on our\nportfolio. As of September 30, 2021, the\nallowance for investment securities was $\n133million and primarily related to non-agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities in the\navailable for sale portfolio. The provision\nfor credit losses on investment securities was\n$ 25million and $ 51million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2021. See Note\n1 Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of\nour 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the\nmethodologies used to determine the allowance\nfor investment securities.\n\nTable 43 presents the gross unrealized losses\nand fair value of securities available for\nsale that do not have an associated allowance\nfor investment securities at September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020. These securities\nare segregated between investments that had\nbeen in a continuous unrealized loss position\nfor less than twelve months and twelve months\nor more, based on the point in time that the\nfair value declined below the amortized cost\nbasis. All securities included in the table\nhave been evaluated to determine if a credit\nloss exists. As part of that assessment, as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, we concluded that we do\nnot intend to sell and believe we will not be\nrequired to sell these securities prior to\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\n\n56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nTable 43: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value\nof Securities Available for Sale Without an\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nInformation relating to gross realized\nsecurities gains and losses from the sales of\nsecurities is set forth in the following\ntable:\nTable 44: Gains (Losses) on Sales of\nSecurities Available for Sale\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           G\u2026         G\u2026         \u2026     T\u2026  \n  \u2026           G\u2026         L\u2026         \u2026     E\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  2\u2026      $  -\u2026      $  50     $  11  \n  \u2026    $  2\u2026      $  -2      $  2\u2026     $  53  \n                                              \n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 57\nThe following table presents, by remaining\ncontractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair\nvalue and weighted-average yield of debt\nsecurities at September 30, 2021:\nTable 45: Contractual Maturity of Debt\nSecurities\n                                              \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n                                  \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                  %      \u2026    \n                                              \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                             $           \u2026    \n                                  %      \u2026    \n                                              \n(a) Weighted-average yields are based on\namortized cost with effective yields weighted\nfor the contractual maturity of each security.\nAt September 30, 2021, there were no\nsecurities of a single issuer, other than FNMA\nand FHLMC, that exceeded 10% of total\nshareholders\u2019 equity.

Loans\nthat are 30 days or more past due in terms of\npayment are considered delinquent. Loan\ndelinquencies include government insured or\nguaranteed loans, loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option and PCD loans.\n\nTable 47 presents the composition and\ndelinquency status of our loan portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in\nApril 2020 and in connection with the credit\nreporting rules from the CARES Act, the\ndelinquency status of loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships aligns with the\nrules set forth for banks to report\ndelinquency status to the credit agencies.\nThese rules require that COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications be reported as follows:\n\n\u2022 if current at the time of modification, the\nloan remains current throughout the\nmodification period,\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was not made current as part\nof the modification, the loan maintains its\nreported delinquent status during the\nmodification period, or\n\n\u2022 if delinquent at the time of modification\nand the borrower was made current as part of\nthe modification or became current during the\nmodification period, the loan is reported as\ncurrent.\n\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to\nCOVID-19 related hardships are not being\nreported as past due as of September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020 based on the contractual\nterms of the loan, even where borrowers may\nnot be making payments on their loans during\nthe modification period. Loan modifications\ndue to COVID-19 related hardships that\npermanently reduce either the contractual\ninterest rate or the principal balance of a\nloan do not qualify for TDR relief under the\nCARES Act or the interagency guidance.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                       10-Q 59\nTable 47: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) (b)\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(a) Amounts in table represent loans held for\ninvestment and do not include any associated\nvaluation allowance.\n(b) The accrued interest associated with our\nloan portfolio totaled $ 0.8billion and $\n0.7billion at September 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively.

This increase was primarily\nattributable to the addition of reserves\nrelated to the BBVA acquisition, partially\noffset by declines due to portfolio changes\nand an improved economic outlook. The\nfollowing summarizes the changes in these\nfactors that influenced the current ACL during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2021:\n\n\u2022 Reserves in the current period include\nexpected credit losses on the acquired BBVA\nloan portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Portfolio changes that drove reserve\ndeclines included improvements in credit\nquality along with changes in portfolio\ncomposition reflecting both shifts in the\nportfolio mix and declines in certain legacy\nPNC loan balances.\n\n\u2022 The economic scenarios used for the period\nended September 30, 2021 reflect an improved\nnear-term economic outlook compared to the\nscenarios used for the period ended December\n31, 2020. The overall improvement in the\ncomparison was driven largely by improvements\nin both the outlook for consumer spending and\nthe labor market, along with the impact from\ncontinued vaccine distribution, while also\nconsidering the lingering effects of COVID-19\nthat slowed the momentum of economic recovery\nin recent months, as the Delta variant\ncontinued to drive increased COVID-19 cases\nthroughout the U.S. and abroad.\n\n68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\n\nN OTE 5 L OAN S ALE AND S ERVICING A CTIVITIES\nAND V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES\n\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\n\nAs more fully described in Note 5 Loan Sale\nand Servicing Activities and Variable Interest\nEntities in Item 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we\nhave transferred residential and commercial\nmortgage loans in securitization or sales\ntransactions in which we have continuing\ninvolvement.

Realized losses for Agency\nsecuritizations are not reflected as we do not\nmanage the underlying real estate upon\nforeclosure and, as such, do not have access\nto loss information.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n\nAs discussed in Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing\nActivities and Variable Interest Entities in\nItem 8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we are involved\nwith various entities in the normal course of\nbusiness that are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of non-\nconsolidated VIEs with which we have\nsignificant continuing involvement but are not\nthe primary beneficiary. We have excluded\ncertain transactions with non-consolidated\nVIEs from the balances presented in Table 58\nwhere we have determined that our continuing\ninvolvement is not significant. We do not\nconsider our continuing involvement to be\nsignificant when it relates to a VIE where we\nonly invest in securities issued by the VIE\nand were not involved in the design of the VIE\nor where no transfers have occurred between us\nand the VIE. In addition, where we only have\nlending arrangements in the normal course of\nbusiness with entities that could be VIEs, we\nhave excluded these transactions with non-\nconsolidated entities from the balances\npresented in Table 58.

Goodwill was\nrecorded and allocated to each segment on a\npreliminary basis and is subject to change\nbased on new information obtained related to\nthe close date or reallocation of assets and\nliabilities to each segment. See Note 2\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activities for\nadditional information.\n\nWe review goodwill in each of our reporting\nunits for impairment at least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or more frequently if events\noccur or circumstances have changed\nsignificantly from the annual test date. Based\non results of our review for triggering\nevents, there were noimpairment charges\nrelated to goodwill in the first nine months\nof 2021 or in 2020.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nWe recognize the right to service mortgage\nloans for others as an intangible asset when\nthe servicing income we receive is more than\nour projected servicing costs. MSRs are\npurchased or originated when loans are sold\nwith servicing retained. MSRs totaled $\n1.8billion and $ 1.2billion at September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and\nconsisted of loan servicing contracts for\ncommercial and residential mortgages measured\nat fair value.\n\nMSRs are subject to declines in value from\nactual or expected prepayment of the\nunderlying loans and defaults, as well as\nmarket driven changes in interest rates. We\nmanage this risk by economically hedging the\nfair value of MSRs with securities and\nderivative instruments which are expected to\nincrease (or decrease) in value when the value\nof MSRs decreases (or increases).\n\nSee the Sensitivity Analysis section of this\nNote 6 for more detail on our fair value\nmeasurement of MSRs.

Management uses both internal\nproprietary models and a third-party model to\nestimate future commercial mortgage loan\nprepayments and a third-party model to\nestimate future residential mortgage loan\nprepayments. These models have been refined\nbased on current market conditions and\nmanagement judgment. Future interest rates are\nanother important factor in the valuation of\nMSRs. Management utilizes market implied\nforward interest rates to estimate the future\ndirection of mortgage and discount rates. The\nforward rates utilized are derived from the\ncurrent yield curve for U.S. dollar interest\nrate swaps and are consistent with pricing of\ncapital markets instruments. Changes in the\nshape and slope of the forward curve in future\nperiods may result in volatility in the fair\nvalue estimate.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse\nchanges in key assumptions is presented in\nTables 61 and 62. These sensitivities do not\ninclude the impact of the related hedging\nactivities. Changes in fair value generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in the assumption\nto the change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, the effect of a variation in a\nparticular assumption on the fair value of the\nMSRs is calculated independently without\nchanging any other assumption. In reality,\nchanges in one factor may result in changes in\nanother ( e.g. , changes in mortgage interest\nrates, which drive changes in prepayment rate\nestimates, could result in changes in the\ninterest rate spread), which could either\nmagnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\nThe following tables set forth the fair value\nof commercial and residential MSRs and the\nsensitivity analysis of the hypothetical\neffect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate\nadverse changes of 10% and 20% in those\nassumptions.\n\nTable 61: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\u2013 Key

Approximately 97% of our net\noutstanding standby letters of credit were\nrated as Pass as of September 30, 2021, with\nthe remainder rated as Criticized. An internal\ncredit rating of Pass indicates the expected\nrisk of loss is currently low, while a rating\nof Criticized indicates a higher degree of\nrisk.\n\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or\nperformance obligation to the third party\nunder the terms of the contract or there is a\nneed to support a remarketing program, then\nupon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the\nterms of the letter of credit, we would be\nobligated to make payment to them.

Designating\nderivatives as accounting hedges allows for\ngains and losses on those derivatives to be\nrecognized in the same period and in the same\nincome statement line item as the earnings\nimpact of the hedged items.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt\ncaused by fluctuations in market interest\nrates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-\nvariable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon\nswaps to hedge changes in the fair value of\nfixed rate and zero-coupon investment\nsecurities caused by fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. Gains and losses on the\ninterest rate swaps designated in these hedge\nrelationships, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses on the hedged items attributable to\nthe hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings within the same income statement line\nitem.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable\ninterest rate swaps and interest rate caps and\nfloors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated commercial loans\nfrom variable to fixed in order to reduce the\nimpact of changes in future cash flows due to\nmarket interest rate changes. We also\nperiodically enter into forward purchase and\nsale contracts to hedge the variability of the\nconsideration that will be paid or received\nrelated to the purchase or sale of investment\nsecurities. The forecasted purchase or sale is\nconsummated upon gross settlement of the\nforward contract itself. For these cash flow\nhedges, gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments are recorded in AOCI and are then\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nthe hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwithin the same income statement line as the\nhedged cash flows.\n\nIn the 12 months that follow September 30,\n2021, we expect to reclassify net derivative\ngains of $ 312million pretax, or $ 240million\nafter-tax, from AOCI to interest income for\nthese cash flow hedge strategies. This\nreclassified amount could differ from amounts\nactually recognized due to changes in interest\nrates, hedge de-designations, and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to September 30,\n2021. As of September 30, 2021, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is ten years.\n\n90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013\nForm 10-Q\nFurther detail

The master netting\nagreements reduce credit risk by permitting\nthe closeout netting of all outstanding\nderivative instruments under the master\nnetting agreement with the same counterparty\nupon the occurrence of an event of default.\nThe master netting agreement also may require\nthe exchange of cash or marketable securities\nto collateralize either party\u2019s net position.\nFor additional information on derivative\noffsetting, counterparty credit risk and\ncontingent features, see Note 16 Financial\nDerivatives in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of our\n2020 Form 10-K.\n\nTable 81 shows the impact legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements had on our\nderivative assets and derivative liabilities\nas of September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. The table includes cash collateral held\nor pledged under legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements. The table also includes\nthe fair value of any securities collateral\nheld or pledged under legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements. Cash and securities\ncollateral amounts are included in the table\nonly to the extent of the related net\nderivative fair values.\n\nTable 81 includes OTC derivatives and OTC\nderivatives cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. OTC derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties that\nare not settled through an organized exchange\nor directly cleared through a central clearing\nhouse. The majority of OTC derivatives are\ngoverned by the ISDA documentation or other\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.\nOTC cleared derivatives represent contracts\nexecuted bilaterally with counterparties in\nthe OTC market that are novated to a central\nclearing house who then becomes our\ncounterparty.

These totals may\ndiffer from the amounts presented in the\npreceding offsetting table because these\ntotals may include collateral exchanged under\nan agreement that does not qualify as a master\nnetting agreement or because the total amount\nof collateral held or pledged exceeds the net\nderivative fair values with the counterparty\nas of the balance sheet date due to timing or\nother factors, such as initial margin. To the\nextent not netted against the derivative fair\nvalues under a master netting agreement, the\nreceivable for cash pledged is included in\nOther assets and the obligation for cash held\nis included in Other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.

If\nour debt ratings were to fall below such\nspecified ratings, the counterparties to the\nderivative instruments could request immediate\npayment or demand immediate and ongoing full\ncollateralization on derivative instruments in\nnet liability positions.

Any such accruals are adjusted\nthereafter as appropriate to reflect changed\ncircumstances. When we are able to do so, we\nalso determine estimates of possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability, for disclosed\nlegal proceedings (\u201cDisclosed Matters,\u201d which\nare those matters disclosed in this Note 13 as\nwell as those matters disclosed in Note 21\nLegal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our\n2020 Form 10-K and in Note 13 Legal\nProceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our first and\nsecond quarter 2021 Form 10-Q (such prior\ndisclosure referred to as \u201cPrior\nDisclosure\u201d)). For Disclosed Matters where we\nare able to estimate such possible losses or\nranges of possible losses, as of September 30,\n2021, we estimate that it is reasonably\npossible that we could incur losses in excess\nof related accrued liabilities, if any, in an\naggregate amount less than $ 100million. The\nestimates included in this amount are based on\nour analysis of currently available\ninformation and are subject to significant\njudgment and a variety of assumptions and\nuncertainties. As new information is obtained\nwe may change our estimates. Due to the\ninherent subjectivity of the assessments and\nunpredictability of outcomes of legal\nproceedings, any amounts accrued or included\nin this aggregate amount may not represent the\nultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings\nin question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate\nlosses may be higher, and possibly\nsignificantly so, than the amounts accrued or\nthis aggregate amount.\n\nAs a result of the types of factors described\nin Note 21 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item\n8 of our 2020 Form 10-K, we are unable, at\nthis time, to estimate the losses that are\nreasonably possible to be incurred or ranges\nof such losses with respect to some of the\nmatters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated\namount provided above does not include an\nestimate for every Disclosed Matter.\nTherefore, as the estimated aggregate amount\ndisclosed above does not include all of the\nDisclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above\ndoes not represent our maximum reasonably\npossible loss exposure for all of the\nDisclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate\namount also does not reflect any of our\nexposure to matters not so disclosed, as\ndiscussed below under \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nWe include in some of the descriptions of\nindividual Disclosed Matters certain\nquantitative information related to the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim against us as alleged in the\nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings or other public filings\nor otherwise publicly available information.\nWhile information of this type may provide\ninsight into the potential magnitude of a\nmatter, it does not necessarily represent our\nestimate of reasonably possible loss or our\njudgment as to any currently appropriate\naccrual.\n\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may\nbe offset by applicable insurance coverage. We\ndo not consider the possible availability of\ninsurance coverage in determining the amounts\nof any accruals (although we record the amount\nof related insurance recoveries that are\ndeemed probable up to the amount of the\naccrual) or in determining any estimates of\npossible losses or ranges of possible losses.\n\nPre-need Funeral Arrangements\n\nNational City Bank and PNC Bank (collectively,\n\"the PNC defendants\") were defendants in a\nlawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Missouri under the\ncaption Jo Ann Howard and Associates, P.C., et\nal. v.

The complaint alleges that BBVA\nUSA\u2019s remote deposit capture systems infringe\nsix patents owned by the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff seeks, among other things, a\njudgment that BBVA USA is infringing each of\nthe patents, damages for willful infringement\nand attorneys\u2019 fees.

In some cases, these inquiries are\npart of review of specified activities at\nmultiple industry participants; in others,\nthey are directed at PNC individually. From\ntime to time, these inquiries have involved\nand may in the future involve or lead to\nregulatory enforcement actions and other\nadministrative proceedings.

Some\nof these inquiries result in remedies\nincluding fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in our business practices, and in\nadditional expenses and collateral costs and\nother consequences. Such remedies and other\nconsequences typically have not been material\nto us from a financial standpoint but could be\nin the future.

To provide more\nmeaningful comparisons of interest income and\nyields for all interest-earning assets, as\nwell as net interest margins, we use interest\nincome on a taxable-equivalent basis in\ncalculating average yields and net interest\nmargin by increasing the interest income\nearned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully\nequivalent to interest income earned on\ntaxable investments.

Under this\nauthorization, repurchases may be made in open\nmarket or privately negotiated transactions,\nwith the timing and exact amount of\n\ncommon stock repurchases depending on a number\nof factors including, among others, market and\ngeneral economic conditions, regulatory\ncapital considerations, alternative\n\nuses of capital, the potential impact on our\ncredit ratings, and contractual and regulatory\nlimitations, including the results of the\nsupervisory assessment of capital adequacy\n\nand capital planning processes undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR\nprocess. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a\ntemporary suspension of our common stock\nrepurchase program in conjunction with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s effort to support the U.S.\neconomy during the pandemic. We continued the\nsuspension through the second quarter of 2021,\nwith the exception of employee benefit-related\npurchases in the third quarter of 2020,\nconsistent with extension of the Federal\nReserves's special capital distribution\nrestrictions. During the second quarter of\n2021, PNC announced the reinstatement of share\nrepurchase programs with repurchases of up to\n$2.9 billion for the four-quarter period\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2021. In the\nthird quarter of 2021, we returned $0.4\nbillion of capital to shareholders through\ncommon share repurchases, representing 2.1\nmillion shares.\n The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. \u2013 Form\n                                      10-Q 105\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 6.
