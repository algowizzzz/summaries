asking\nyou to elect each of the 21 director nominees \nlisted below to serve on the Board of         \nDirectors for a one-yearterm expiring at the  \nannual meeting of shareholders in 2024.       \nTruist\u2019s bylaws provide that each director    \nnominee requires the affirmative vote of the  \nmajority of votes cast to be elected. Although\nour Board of Directors expects that each of   \nthe nominees will be available for election,  \nif a vacancy in the slate of nominees occurs, \nit is intended that shares of Truist common   \nstock represented by proxies will be voted for\nthe election of a substitute nominee,         \ndesignated by the Board. Alternatively, the   \nBoard may reduce the number of persons to be  \nelected by the number of directors unable to  \nserve. Each of our director nominees has been \nidentified as possessing good business acumen,\nstrength of character, an independent mind, as\nwell as a reputation for integrity and the    \nhighest personal and professional ethics.     \nSound judgment and community leadership are   \nalso important characteristics that our Board \nmembers possess. Each nominee additionally    \nbrings to us a strong and unique background   \nand set of skills, providing our Board with   \ncompetence and experience in the wide variety \nof areas necessary and helpful in overseeing  \nTruist\u2019s strategy, culture and performance.   \nOver the past three years since the merger,   \nour directors have exhibited an unwavering    \ncommitment to Truist, building upon the       \nsuccesses of the heritage companies. We also  \nnote that four of our directors will reach the\nmandatory retirement age of 75 during 2023 and\nare expected to retire from the Board at the  \nend of the year, consistent with our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines. As a result, we expect \nto begin 2024 with a Board consisting of      \napproximately 17 members. Board Diversity and \nComposition One of the Board\u2019s goals, which is\na focus of the Nominating and Governance      \nCommittee, is to include directors with       \ndiverse backgrounds, expertise and            \ncharacteristics that, taken as a whole, will  \nhelp ensure a strong and effective governing  \nbody. The Nominating and Governance Committee \nregularly reviews the skills and composition  \nof the Board and its committees to determine  \nthe appropriate balance of skills,            \nqualifications and backgrounds to best meet   \nthe Company\u2019s needs and strategies. At Truist,\nwe are proud of our long commitment to        \ndiversity among our teammates, members of     \nExecutive Leadership and Board of Directors.  \nOf our 21 directors, seven are women,         \nrepresenting one-thirdof our Board, four are  \nBlack, comprising almost 20% of our Board, one\nis Hispanic, and together approximately 43% of\nour Board is either racially, ethnically or   \ngender diverse. Moreover, women hold key      \nleadership positions on our Board, such as our\nNominating and Governance Committee Chair and \nTechnology Committee Chair. Our directors also\nhave a broad range of tenures on our Board and\ndiverse backgrounds and expertise, which      \noffers strong and broad perspectives on the   \nfinancial services industry and the trends and\nevolution currently taking place in banking. *\nBoard tenure includes each Director\u2019s Board   \nservice at Truist and either BB&T or SunTrust,\nas applicable.

Working with its independent         \ncompensation consultant, the Compensation and \nHuman Capital Committee annually assesses the \ncompetitiveness of Truist\u2019s director          \ncompensation program relative to our peers. In\nmaking this assessment, the Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee reviews (i) the       \nindividual pay components of our program      \nrelative to the pay components for directors  \nat our peers, (ii) the average total          \ncompensation of our board members relative to \ndirectors at our peers, and (iii) our         \naggregate board compensation as compared to   \nour peer group. The director compensation     \nshown in the table above reflects total       \ncompensation paid to each director for service\nas a joint member on the Boards of the Company\nand Truist Bank. A director who is also a     \nteammate of Truist or its subsidiaries is not \neligible to receive any equity, retainer or   \nfees for service on the Board of Directors.   \n                                 \n  26    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 1\u2014Election of Directors The table    \nbelow shows fees paid to our non-             \nemployeedirectors for 2022 and the fees they  \nare entitled to receive in 2023.

The Truist Amended and Restated Non-    \nEmployeeDirectors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan \npermits participating non-employeedirectors to\ndefer 50% or 100% of their retainer fees into \na deferred savings account and also to defer  \n100% of their equity compensation awards.     \nParticipating non-employeedirectors make an   \nelection upon entering the plan regarding the \ndeferral of their non-employeedirector fees   \nand/or equity compensation awards and the form\nof distributions under the plan. Deferrals of \nretainer fees are fully vested at all times   \nand are payable in cash after termination of  \nthe director\u2019s service on the Board. Deferred \nequity awards are payable in Truist shares    \nafter termination of a director\u2019s service on  \nthe Board. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Truist \nrequires each non-employeedirector to hold or \ncontrol an amount of common stock equal to 5x \nthe amount of his or her annual cash retainer \npaid by Truist for such director\u2019s services.  \nAll non-employeedirectors are expected to meet\nthis ownership requirement by the later of (i)\nfive years following initial appointment as a \ndirector, or (ii) such period of time as it   \nmay take to reach the ownership requirement   \nthreshold by holding shares or RSUs granted by\nTruist pursuant to the equity compensation    \narrangements for directors. All directors     \neither meet the minimum ownership requirement \nor are still within the time frame allowed to \nachieve such ownership.                       \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    27  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance The Board of Directors   \nregularly reviews Truist\u2019s corporate          \ngovernance program taking into account best   \npractices, recent developments and the        \nrequirements of applicable laws and           \nregulations.                                  \n                                              \n                Key Corporate                 \n                Governance                    \n                Documents                     \n  Please visit                                \n  our website                                 \n  at https:                                   \n  //ir.truist\u2026                                \n  under                                       \n  \u201cGovernance                                 \n  &                            \u2022\u2002\u2009Corporate   \n  Responsibil\u2026                 Governance     \n  to view our                  Guidelines \u00a0   \n  corporate                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Articles    \n  governance                   of             \n  documents.

The Corporate Governance\nGuidelines address a number of matters        \napplicable to directors, including director   \nqualification standards, director independence\nrequirements, share ownership guidelines,     \nBoard responsibilities, Board development,    \nrole of the independent Lead Director,        \nretirement, meetings of non-                  \nmanagementdirectors, and director             \ncompensation. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Our Board \nof Directors is committed to maintaining      \nobjective, independent oversight of management\nin upholding its responsibilities to our      \nshareholders and in carrying out the strategic\nobjectives of the Company. The value we place \non the independence of our directors is       \nreflected in our corporate governance         \ndocuments, Board committee charters, annual   \nindependence review of our Board members and  \nthe role of our Lead Director. In determining \ndirector independence, our Board considers the\nNew York Stock Exchange\u2019s (\u201cNYSE\u201d) bright-line\nindependence criteria and the standards set   \nforth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. \nConsistent with NYSE rules, our Board of      \nDirectors also broadly considers all other    \nrelevant facts and circumstances that bear on \nthe materiality of each director\u2019s            \nrelationship with Truist, including the       \npotential for conflicts of interest, when     \ndetermining director independence. In making  \nan independence determination, no director    \nqualifies as \u201cindependent\u201d unless the Board   \naffirmatively determines that the director has\nno material relationship, and has not had such\na relationship within the past three years,   \nwith Truist or any of its subsidiaries.       \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    29  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance                          \nTo assist it in making                        \nindependence                                  \ndeterminations, our                           \nBoard of Directors has                        \nadopted categorical                           \nstandards, which are                          \ncontained in our                              \nCorporate Governance                          \nGuidelines.

As a part of this evaluation process, \nthe Nominating and Governance Committee also  \nconsiders each director\u2019s occupation, other   \npublicly held company directorships, personal \nand affiliate transactions with Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, relationships considered in     \naccordance with our Related Person            \nTransactions Policy, and other relevant direct\nand indirect relationships that may affect    \nindependence. In particular, the Board        \nconsidered Truist\u2019s purchase or provision of  \nproducts or services during the last three    \nyears from or to each entity where a director,\nincluding Messrs. Clement and Donahue, was an \nexecutive officer or employee of such entity, \nor had an immediate family member who was an  \nexecutive officer of such entity, and where   \nthat entity made payments to or received      \npayments from Truist or any of its            \nsubsidiaries for products or services;        \nhowever, all such transactions were made: (a) \nin the ordinary course of business on         \nsubstantially the same terms as those         \nprevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties, (b) in   \nthe aggregate for any single fiscal year, did \nnot exceed 0.25% of Truist\u2019s or such other    \nentity\u2019s gross revenue, and (c) were          \nimmaterial to both Truist and the other       \nentity.

Each member of the Audit Committee,\nthe Compensation and Human Capital Committee  \nand the Nominating and Governance Committee   \nhas been determined by the Board to be        \n\u201cindependent\u201d in accordance with the          \nrequirements of the NYSE and our Corporate    \nGovernance Guidelines. For more details on our\nindependence requirements, see our Corporate  \nGovernance Guidelines, which are not          \nincorporated into this proxy statement by     \nreference, but which can be found on the      \nInvestor Relations page of our website at     \nhttps://ir.truist.comunder \u201cGovernance &      \nResponsibility\u201d\u2014\u201cCorporate Governance\u201d.       \nCHANGES TO JOB RESPONSIBILITIES OR POSITION If\na director changes his or her principal       \nemployment activity, position or              \nresponsibility, he or she must notify the     \nChairman of the Board and the Chair of the    \nNominating and Governance Committee of such   \nchange and offer his or her resignation from  \nthe Board. Prior to the resignation becoming  \neffective, the Board, through the Nominating  \nand Governance Committee, will review any such\nchange and determine whether to accept or     \nreject the director\u2019s resignation. SERVICE ON \nOTHER BOARDS A director must advise the       \nChairman of the Board and the Chair of the    \nNominating and Governance Committee before    \naccepting an invitation to serve on another   \npublic or private company board. If the       \ninvitation is to serve on another public      \ncompany board, the Nominating and Governance  \nCommittee will review whether such board      \nservice may unduly impact the ability of the  \ndirector to fulfill his or her                \nresponsibilities as a director of Truist and  \nmust approve such board service before the    \ndirector accepts the additional position. A   \nnon-employeedirector of Truist may not serve  \non more than three other public company       \nboards, and a non-employeedirector of Truist  \nwho is also the chief executive officer of    \nanother public company may not serve on more  \nthan two public company boards, including the \nTruist Board. In addition, if a member of the \nAudit Committee desires to serve on the audit \ncommittees of more than a total of three      \npublic companies, the Board must approve such \nadditional service before the director accepts\nthe additional position. Members of Truist\u2019s  \nExecutive Leadership team may serve on one    \npublic company board, in addition to the      \nTruist Board, with the approval of the Chief  \nExecutive Officer or, in the case of the Chief\nExecutive Officer, the Nominating and         \nGovernance Committee.                         \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    31  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance BOARD DEVELOPMENT Our    \nBoard Development Program provides a formal   \nframework designed to support the directors\u2019  \nperformance of their responsibilities as      \nmembers of the Board and Board committees. The\nBoard Development Program allows directors to \nsupplement their existing skill sets and stay \ninformed of emerging risks and trends in      \nTruist\u2019s business and the broader financial   \nservices industry in general. The Board,      \nthrough formal annual polling and informal    \nrequests throughout the year, identifies areas\nof focus for development opportunities. In    \naddition, certain topics are included in the  \nschedule as \u201ccore\u201d requirements, such as      \nreviews and updates on anti-money laundering, \nFederal Reserve Board Regulation O and insider\ntrading. As a result, development             \nopportunities are planned throughout the year \nand presented at meetings of the Board on a   \nregular basis. The programs and courses are   \nprovided by both in-houseexperts and outside  \nadvisors on a wide range of topics to enhance \nthe directors\u2019 knowledge in areas important in\ncarrying out their responsibilities as        \ndirectors. Programs and presentations of      \ngeneral application are offered to the full   \nBoard while others are tailored to the        \nspecific requirements of the various Board    \ncommittees. Directors are also encouraged to  \npursue outside learning opportunities,        \nincluding programs presented by Truist\u2019s      \nregulators and industry associations. To      \nfacilitate awareness of these programs and    \nencourage participation, Truist makes         \navailable to directors a dynamic calendar of  \nrelevant external offerings. Truist encourages\ndirectors to report their participation in    \nexternal programs to the Office of the        \nCorporate Secretary, which maintains a record \nof all internal development activity, as well \nas external programs as conveyed by the       \ndirectors. Management reports annually to the \nNominating and Governance Committee with      \nrespect to completed development activity over\nthe past year and plans for future development\nopportunities. Newly elected directors undergo\nan extensive director orientation process. We \nview the director orientation process as a    \nmeans to acquaint newly elected directors with\nour businesses and corporate governance       \nframework, and also to further our directors\u2019 \nunderstanding of our culture and the Board\u2019s  \nrole in determining the Company\u2019s culture and \noverseeing management\u2019s assurance of corporate\nintegrity. Our Chief Legal Officer and other  \nmembers of Executive Leadership facilitate a  \ndetailed Board orientation session. These     \nsessions review the Company\u2019s culture and     \nvalues, code of ethics, strategic objectives  \nand planning, risk management matters,        \ncompliance programs, internal audit services  \nand our corporate governance program.         \nAdditional topics covered in orientation      \ninclude the Company\u2019s business structure,     \nincluding regulatory oversight, laws governing\ndirectors\u2019 duties and conduct, Truist\u2019s       \nsecurities law policies, and liability        \ninsurance coverage. Additionally, new         \ndirectors and rotating directors (including   \ndirectors elevated to the role of chair) each \nattend an orientation of the committee(s) on  \nwhich they serve, which covers in detail the  \noperation and duties of the relevant          \ncommittee. BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE SELF-    \nASSESSMENT On an annual basis, our Board of   \nDirectors evaluates its effectiveness over the\npreceding year. Each director participates in \nthe evaluation process and each committee is  \nseparately evaluated. The evaluation process  \nis managed by our Nominating and Governance   \nCommittee with assistance from our Office of  \nthe Corporate Secretary. During our Board     \nevaluation process, directors are presented   \nwith a written questionnaire designed to      \nelicit constructive feedback from each        \ndirector about the effectiveness of the Board \nand each committee on which the director      \nserves. In 2022, the Chairman or Lead Director\nseparately called each director personally    \nafter distribution of the questionnaires to   \nsolicit concerns or input regarding the       \nperformance of the Board or its committees.   \nResponses received from our directors are     \ndiscussed with the full Board as well as each \nstanding committee in executive sessions. This\nfeedback is used to improve Board and         \ncommittee practices, procedures and policies  \nand, as appropriate, is discussed with members\nof Executive Leadership to improve            \nefficiencies and effectiveness. SUCCESSION    \nPLANNING AT TRUIST Human capital management   \nand talent development is a priority for the  \nBoard of Directors. Our Corporate Governance  \nGuidelines provide that the Board of Directors\nis responsible for ensuring that we have      \ndeveloped an Executive Leadership succession  \nplan, including procedures for Chief Executive\nOfficer selection in the event of an emergency\nor the retirement of the CEO. This plan is    \nreviewed and evaluated by the Board at least  \nannually. The Lead Director facilitates the   \nBoard\u2019s review and evaluation of our Executive\nLeadership succession plan. As part of the    \nplan, our Chairman and CEO evaluates and      \nrecommends potential successors, along with a \nreview of any development plans of such       \nindividuals. In accordance with a resolution  \nadopted by the Board of Directors regarding   \nemergency succession, if Mr. Rogers becomes   \nunable to serve as Truist\u2019s Chief Executive   \nOfficer, the independent Lead Director is     \nauthorized to (i) promptly call a special     \nmeeting of the Board of Directors to appoint  \nan individual to assume the authority and     \nresponsibility of Chief Executive Officer on a\ntemporary or permanent basis, depending upon  \nthe circumstances; and (ii) assume the        \nresponsibility of the Chief Executive Officer,\nwithout the necessity of further action by the\nBoard of Directors, pending such appointment. \nBoard Leadership Structure CHAIRMAN OF THE    \nBOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Our Board of\nDirectors is led by the Chairman. Under our   \nbylaws, the Chairman is elected by the Board  \nand presides over each Board meeting and      \nperforms such other duties as may be incident \nto the office of Chairman. Our bylaws and     \nCorporate Governance Guidelines each provide  \nthat the Chairman may also hold the position  \nof Chief Executive Officer. Truist\u2019s Chairman \nand Chief Executive Officer is not permitted  \nto serve as a member of any standing Board    \nCommittee, other than the Executive Committee,\nthe Risk Committee or the                     \n                                 \n  32    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance Technology Committee. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that  \nwhen the position of Chairman of the Board is \nnot held by an independent director, the Board\nwill appoint an independent Lead Director. It \nis the Board\u2019s current belief that having a   \nunified Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  \nis appropriate and in the best interests of   \nTruist and our shareholders. The Board        \nbelieves that combining the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer roles at this time provides \nthe following advantages to us:               \n                                              \n     our Chief Executive Officer is more      \n     familiar with our current business and   \n  \u2022  industry than our non-management         \n     directors and is best situated to lead   \n     discussions on important matters         \n     affecting the business of Truist;        \n                                              \n                                              \n     combining the Chief Executive Officer    \n     and Chairman positions, along with a     \n     strong partnership with the independent  \n  \u2022  Lead Director, creates a firm link       \n     between management and the Board and     \n     promotes both the development and        \n     implementation of corporate strategy;    \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     combining the roles of Chief Executive   \n     Officer and Chairman contributes to a    \n  \u2022  more efficient and effective Board,      \n     promotes unity of vision for the         \n     Company and avoids potential conflict    \n     among directors.                         \n                                              \nThe Board is aware of the potential issues    \nthat may arise when an insider chairs the     \nboard of a company but believes these are more\nthan offset by existing safeguards, which     \ninclude the designation of a strong           \nindependent Lead Director with a clearly      \ndefined role and authority set forth in our   \nCorporate Governance Guidelines and discussed \nfurther below. In addition, our Board         \nregularly meets in executive session, chaired \nby the independent Lead Director, with the    \nnon-managementdirectors outside the presence  \nof management. Further, only our independent  \ndirectors are involved in meetings to discuss \nsuccession planning and CEO compensation,     \nwhere peer benchmarking is extensively used.  \nINDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR Effective March 12, \n2022, Thomas E. Skains was appointed as the   \nBoard\u2019s independent Lead Director, subject to \nthe normal rotation policy for Lead Director  \nservice as set forth in our Corporate         \nGovernance Guidelines. This Lead Director     \ntransition was effected pursuant to the terms \nof the merger agreement that resulted in the  \ncreation of Truist and coincided with Mr.     \nRogers\u2019 appointment as Chairman of the Board  \nof Directors. Going forward, our Lead Director\nwill be selected as described in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, which require that our \nLead Director (i) be appointed by a majority  \nvote of the independent directors and (ii)    \nserve in such capacity for an initial two-    \nyearterm (subject to annual election as a     \ndirector by the shareholders), and may serve  \nfor subsequent one-yearterm(s) at the         \ndiscretion of the Board. The role of the Lead \nDirector is to assist the Chairman and the    \nremainder of the Board in assuring effective  \ngovernance in overseeing the direction and    \nmanagement of Truist. Our Board believes that \nthe Lead Director serves an important         \ncorporate governance function by providing    \nstrong, independent leadership for the non-   \nmanagementdirectors and provides an           \nappropriate balance to the Chairman and CEO.  \nIn addition to the formal list of duties      \nperformed by our Lead Director as set forth in\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines, he also  \nmeets with regulators, participates in        \nshareholder engagement calls and attends      \nmeetings with senior management. Our          \nindependent Lead Director also presides over  \nmeetings of our non-managementdirectors in    \nexecutive session in connection with each     \nregularly scheduled Board meeting and at such \nother times as deemed necessary or desirable. \nA more complete description of the role of our\nLead Director is included in our Corporate    \nGovernance Guidelines and in the discussion   \nabove under, \u201cStanding Board Committee        \nMembership and Lead Director                  \nResponsibilities.\u201d In 2020, our Board of      \nDirectors approved changes to our Corporate   \nGovernance Guidelines, placing the following  \nadditional responsibilities on the role of our\nindependent Lead Director:                    \n                                              \n     Approve Board agendas and information    \n  \u2022  sent to the Board in preparation for     \n     Board meetings                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Authority to call and preside over       \n     meetings of the independent directors    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Approve all Board and committee meeting  \n     schedules                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Preside over executive sessions of the   \n  \u2022  non-management directors, which will     \n     occur at each regularly scheduled Board  \n     meeting                                  \n                                              \nIn 2022, our Board of Directors approved      \nfurther changes to our Corporate Governance   \nGuidelines, placing the following additional  \nresponsibilities on the role of our           \nindependent Lead Director in the event that   \nthe positions of Chairman and CEO are combined\nand that individual also serves as the Chair  \nof the Executive Committee:                   \n                                              \n  \u2022  Serve as a member of the Executive       \n     Committee                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Approve the scheduling of Executive      \n  \u2022  Committee meetings, suggest matters for  \n     inclusion on the Executive Committee     \n     agendas, and approve such agendas        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Approve information sent to Executive    \n  \u2022  Committee members in preparation for     \n     and at Executive Committee meetings      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Preside at all meetings of the           \n  \u2022  Executive Committee at which the Chair   \n     is not present (including executive      \n     sessions)                                \n                                              \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    33  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance We believe that these    \nenhancements further strengthen the role of   \nour Lead Director and provide an appropriate  \nbalance to the Chairman and CEO at Truist.    \nBoard Size As part of the merger agreement    \nbetween BB&T and SunTrust, the size of our    \nBoard of Directors was set at 22. Following   \nthe resignation of director Paul R. Garcia in \nOctober 2021, the Board took the opportunity  \nto amend Truist\u2019s bylaws and reduce the size  \nof the Board to 21 directors. This decision   \nwas based, in part, on feedback we had        \nreceived from our shareholder engagement      \nprogram. The size of our Board has provided an\nadvantage when evaluating our committee       \nstructure, including the decision to create a \nTechnology Committee to assist the Board in   \nits oversight of technology strategy and risk,\nand assigning an appropriate number of members\nto each committee in order to properly analyze\nand respond to increasingly complex           \ndevelopments, whether regulatory, economic,   \ntechnological or otherwise. The diversity of  \nviewpoints on each committee also allows for  \nmore effective challenge to proposals from    \nmanagement and directors. In addition, the    \nnumber of independent directors aids in       \nmaintaining the requisite independence        \nstandards of the Audit, Compensation and Human\nCapital, and Nominating and Governance        \nCommittees While our Board believes its       \ncurrent size has provided advantages,         \nincluding overseeing the integration of our   \ntwo heritage companies following the merger of\nequals, navigating the challenges presented by\nthe COVID-19pandemic and addressing the       \nsignificant regulatory, economic, and         \ntechnological pressures experienced by        \nfinancial institutions, our Board will        \ncontinue to annually evaluate its size and    \nstructure. We also note that four of our      \ndirectors will reach the mandatory retirement \nage of 75 during 2023 and are expected to     \nretire from the Board at the end of the year, \nconsistent with our Corporate Governance      \nGuidelines. As a result, we expect to begin   \n2024 with a Board consisting of approximately \n17 members. Nominating and Governance         \nCommittee Director Nominations The Nominating \nand Governance Committee is responsible for   \nidentifying and recommending to the Board     \nnominees for election or reelection as        \ndirectors. We seek as director candidates     \nindividuals who possess good judgment,        \nstrength of character, and an independent     \nmind, as well as a reputation for integrity   \nand the highest personal and professional     \nethics in order to most effectively serve the \nlong-term interests of Truist and its         \nshareholders. The Nominating and Governance   \nCommittee considers candidates submitted by   \ndirectors and third-party search firms hired  \nfor identifying director candidates. The      \nNominating and Governance Committee also      \nconsiders candidates submitted by             \nshareholders, subject to the requirements     \ndescribed below. As evidenced by the          \ncomposition of our Board, the Nominating and  \nGovernance Committee strives to include       \ndirector candidates who are racially,         \nethnically and gender diverse, with skills and\ncharacteristics that, taken as a whole, will  \nhelp ensure a strong and effective governing  \nbody. The Nominating and Governance Committee \nconducts an extensive due diligence process to\nreview potential director candidates and their\nindividual qualifications, and all such       \ncandidates, including those submitted by      \nshareholders, will be evaluated by the        \nNominating and Governance Committee using the \ndirector membership criteria described below. \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee then  \nreports to the Board its recommendations      \nconcerning each director nominee. The Board   \nconsiders the Nominating and Governance       \nCommittee\u2019s recommendations when appointing   \ndirectors and selecting director nominees to  \nbe submitted by Truist to shareholders for    \nelection at the annual meeting of             \nshareholders. DIRECTOR MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA A  \ndirector candidate is nominated to stand for  \nelection based on his or her professional     \nexperience, strategic insights, recognized    \nachievement in his or her respective field, an\nability to contribute to our business,        \nexperience in risk management, and the        \nwillingness to make the commitment of time and\neffort required of a Truist director over an  \nextended period of time. A director must be   \n\u201cfinancially literate,\u201d as defined by the     \nBoard, and should understand the intricacies  \nof a public company. A director should possess\ngood judgment, strength of character, and an  \nindependent mind, as well as a reputation for \nintegrity and the highest personal and        \nprofessional ethics. Other factors are also   \nconsidered to ensure the overall composition  \nof the Truist Board is appropriate. An        \nimportant goal of the Board, pursued through  \nthe Nominating and Governance Committee, is to\ninclude members with diverse backgrounds,     \nexpertise and characteristics (including      \ndiversity of race, ethnicity and gender) that,\ntaken as a whole, will help ensure a strong   \nand effective governing body. The Nominating  \nand Governance Committee annually assesses    \nthese factors in the director selection and   \nnomination process. DIRECTOR CANDIDATES       \nRECOMMENDED BY SHAREHOLDERS The Board of      \nDirectors also will consider qualified        \ndirector nominees submitted in advance by     \nshareholders when such recommendations are    \nsubmitted with the information set forth in   \nArticle II, Section 10 of the Company\u2019s       \nbylaws.

Shareholders\nand director nominees utilizing this provision\nof our bylaws must satisfy the specific       \ninformation required by Article II, Section 14\nof our bylaws. In addition, notice of any such\nnomination must be received at least 120 days,\nbut no more than 150 days, before the         \nanniversary of the date that the Company      \ncommenced mailing the proxy statement for the \nprior year\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders.  \nWritten notices pursuant to the above bylaw   \nprovisions must be submitted in accordance    \nwith the general procedures for shareholder   \nnominations (including deadlines for the      \nnotice to be received by the Corporate        \nSecretary), which are summarized under the    \ncaption \u201cVoting and Other Information-        \nProposals for the 2024 Annual Meeting of      \nShareholders\u201d below. Shareholders may submit, \nin writing, the names and qualifications of   \npotential director nominees to the Corporate  \nSecretary, Truist Financial Corporation, 214  \nN. Tryon Street, 43 rdFloor, Mail Code        \n500-93-43-13,Charlotte, North Carolina 28202. \nMajority Voting and Director Resignation      \nPolicy Our articles of incorporation require  \neach director to be elected by the majority of\nthe votes cast at a meeting of shareholders.  \nUnder our Director Resignation Policy, as     \ndescribed in our Corporate Governance         \nGuidelines, any director nominee who receives \na greater number of votes \u201cagainst\u201d than votes\n\u201cfor\u201d such election shall tender his or her   \nresignation to the Board. The Nominating and  \nGovernance Committee will then consider all of\nthe relevant facts and circumstances and      \nrecommend to the Board whether to accept,     \nreject or otherwise act with respect to such  \nresignation. The Board will act on the        \nNominating and Governance Committee\u2019s         \nrecommendation within 90 days following       \ncertification of the shareholder vote and will\npublicly disclose its decision within this    \n90-daytimeframe. A director whose resignation \nis under consideration will abstain from      \nparticipating in any recommendation or        \ndecision regarding that resignation. If a     \ndirector\u2019s resignation is not accepted, the   \ndirector will continue to serve until the next\nannual meeting of shareholders and until the  \ndirector\u2019s successor is elected and qualified,\nor until the director\u2019s earlier resignation or\nremoval. Currently, pursuant to North Carolina\nlaw and our bylaws, an incumbent director who \nis not re-electedremains in office until the  \ndirector\u2019s successor is elected and qualified \nor until his or her earlier resignation or    \nremoval. Our current Director Resignation     \nPolicy addresses this \u201choldover\u201d issue by     \nrequiring any director who does not receive   \nthe requisite affirmative majority of the     \nvotes cast for his or her re-electionto tender\nhis or her resignation to the Board as        \ndescribed above. Related Person Transactions  \nPursuant to our Related Person Transactions   \nPolicy, we approve or ratify related person   \ntransactions only when the Board, acting      \nthrough the Nominating and Governance         \nCommittee, determines that the related person \ntransaction in question is in, or is not      \ninconsistent with, the best interests of      \nTruist and its shareholders. The term \u201crelated\nperson transaction,\u201d under the Related Person \nTransactions Policy, generally means a        \ntransaction where the amount involved exceeds \n$120,000 in a single fiscal year and in which \na related person has a direct or indirect     \nmaterial interest. A \u201crelated person\u201d under   \nthe Related Person Transactions Policy        \ngenerally means (a) a director, director      \nnominee or executive officer of Truist; (b) a \nperson who is known to be the beneficial owner\nof more than five percent of any class of our \ncommon stock; and (c) any immediate family    \nmember of any of the foregoing persons, which \nconsists of any child, stepchild, parent,     \nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law,   \nfather-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,   \nbrother-in-lawor                              \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    35  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance sister-in-lawof the      \ndirector, executive officer, nominee, or more \nthan five percent beneficial owner, and any   \nperson (other than a tenant or employee)      \nsharing the household of such director,       \nexecutive officer, nominee, or more than five \npercent beneficial owner. To help the Board   \nassess whether a material relationship exists \nfor both independence and related person      \ntransactions purposes, our Board adopted      \nguidance with regard to charitable            \ncontributions. Under this guidance, a related \nperson who serves as an executive officer of a\ncharitable or non-profitorganization that     \nreceives a contribution from Truist will not  \nbe deemed to have a direct or indirect        \nmaterial interest in the transaction if:      \n                                              \n     Within the past three years, the         \n     aggregate amount of all such             \n     contributions during any single fiscal   \n     year of the charitable or non-profit     \n  \u2022  organization did not exceed the greater  \n     of $1\u00a0million or 2% of the charitable    \n     or non-profit organization\u2019s             \n     consolidated gross revenues for that     \n     fiscal year; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     The charitable or non-profit             \n     organization is not a family foundation  \n  \u2022  created by the related person or an      \n     immediate family member of the related   \n     person.                                  \n                                              \nIn addition, to monitor charitable            \ncontributions provided by Truist, any         \ncharitable contribution in excess of $5       \nmillion made by Truist to any charitable or   \nnon-profitorganization of which a director or \nexecutive officer of Truist serves as a       \ndirector, trustee, executive officer, advisory\nboard member or in any similar leadership     \ncapacity must be approved by the Nominating   \nand Governance Committee, whether or not the  \ndirector or executive officer has a direct or \nindirect material interest in the             \ncontribution. Further, charitable             \ncontributions of $500,000 or more to such     \norganizations must be reported at the next    \nNominating and Governance Committee meeting. A\nnumber of our directors, members of Executive \nLeadership, including our NEOs, and their     \naffiliates utilize certain products and       \nservices offered by Truist, including personal\nand corporate banking, securities brokerage,  \ninvestment advisory and wealth management     \nservices, in the ordinary course of our       \nbusiness. Our Related Person Transactions     \nPolicy provides that certain categories of    \ntransactions do not need review or approval of\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee. These\ninclude all extensions of credit with related \npersons that are made in the ordinary course  \nof business on substantially the same terms,  \nincluding interest rates and collateral, as   \nthose prevailing at the time for comparable   \nloans with persons not related to Truist, and \nthat do not involve more than the normal risk \nof collectability or present other features   \nunfavorable to Truist (although pursuant to   \nFederal Reserve Board Regulation O, extensions\nof credit to directors, executive officers or \ntheir related interests that exceed $500,000  \nin the aggregate must be approved in advance  \nby the full Board). These transactions also   \ninclude any provision of financial services to\na related person, other than extensions of    \ncredit, such as brokerage, banking, insurance,\ninvestment advisory, investment banking or    \nasset management services, if the services are\nprovided in the ordinary course of business,  \non substantially the same terms as those      \nprevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties and comply\nwith applicable law. In addition, in the      \nordinary course of business, Truist may use   \nthe products or services of organizations of  \nwhich one of our directors is an officer or   \ndirector. Since January 1, 2022, other than as\ndescribed below, there have been no related   \nperson transactions that were required either \nto be approved or ratified under our Related  \nPerson Transactions Policy or reported under  \nthe SEC\u2019s related person transaction rules.   \nBased on information contained in separate    \nSchedule 13G/A filings with the SEC, each of  \nBlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc.  \nreported that it beneficially owned more than \n5% of the outstanding shares of our common    \nstock as of December 31, 2022. During 2022,   \nwe, and our affiliates, engaged in            \ntransactions in the ordinary course of        \nbusiness with BlackRock and Vanguard,         \nincluding sales of debt securities of the     \nCompany and Truist Bank in public offerings of\nthose securities and sales of other fixed     \nincome securities by our institutional broker-\ndealer subsidiary. Such transactions were on  \nsubstantially the same terms as those         \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \ntransactions with unrelated third parties.    \nSection 16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the    \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange\nAct\u201d) requires our directors, executive       \nofficers and any persons who own beneficially \nmore than 10% of our common stock to file     \nreports of ownership and changes in ownership \nwith the SEC. To our knowledge, based solely  \non a review of the reports furnished to us and\nwritten representations from reporting persons\nthat all reportable transactions were         \nreported, we believe that during the fiscal   \nyear ended December 31, 2022, our officers,   \ndirectors and greater than 10% owners timely  \nfiled all reports they were required to file  \nunder Section 16(a). Shareholder Engagement   \nProgram GENERAL Truist\u2019s shareholder          \nengagement program is a robust, year-round    \nprocess that includes outreach to             \nshareholders, incorporating analysis of       \nresults of our annual meeting, key topics of  \nimportance to our shareholders, and board     \ndeliberations. We listen closely to our       \nshareholders to understand their views on a   \nvariety of topics, including our executive    \ncompensation and corporate governance         \n                                 \n  36    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance programs, as well as     \ncorporate responsibility and sustainability   \nissues involving the Company.

Topics discussed\nat these meetings included, among other items:\n(1) corporate governance; (2) corporate social\nresponsibility and initiatives Truist is      \npursuing in this area; and (3) executive      \ncompensation matters. Shareholders were       \nespecially supportive of the Company\u2019s efforts\nin areas related to the environment, social   \nissues, including diversity, equity and       \ninclusion initiatives, and financial inclusion\nmatters and provided helpful feedback and     \nviews on other topics, such as board size and \nrefreshment, executive compensation metrics   \nand greenhouse gas emissions and other        \nclimate-related disclosures. Following these  \ncalls, Company management reviews shareholder \nfeedback with the Nominating and Governance   \nCommittee and takes that feedback into        \nconsideration, along with feedback from our   \nBoard of Directors, feedback from shareholders\nreceived outside of our fall                  \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    37  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance outreach effort, and peer\npractices, when planning future company       \npolicies, practices, and disclosures in public\nfilings.

Truist participates in\npolicy debates on issues to support our       \ninterests and sponsors employee nonprofit,    \nunincorporated political action committees, or\n\u201cPACs,\u201d which allow teammates to voluntarily  \npool their financial resources to support     \nfederal and state candidates who support      \nlegislation important to us, and our          \nshareholders, clients and communities. All PAC\nexpenditures are a matter of public record and\nare available for review on the websites of   \nthe Federal Election Commission and various   \nstate election offices. The political spending\nof Truist\u2019s PACs is also disclosed on the     \ncorporate governance page of Truist\u2019s investor\nrelations website (                           \nhttps://ir.truist.com/corporate-governance).  \nThe Truist PACs are governed by a board of    \ndirectors that is charged with oversight of   \nPAC activities as well as the development of  \npolicies governing contributions,             \nsolicitations, and communications. Consistent \nwith U.S. federal law, Truist does not use    \ncorporate funds to contribute to federal,     \nstate, or local political candidates,         \npolitical parties, or political committees    \norganized for the advancement of a political  \ncandidate, including Super PACs, or otherwise \nemploy its resources, including in-kind,even  \nwhen permitted by law. The Truist PAC supports\ncandidates who drive policies to help         \nfinancial institutions continue to innovate,  \nserve our communities, and advance the success\nand prosperity of our clients.

The Audit       \nCommittee has carefully considered the        \nselection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP       \n(\u201cPwC\u201d) as the independent registered public  \naccounting firm to audit and report on the    \nconsolidated financial statements of Truist   \nand the effectiveness of our internal control \nover financial reporting. SHAREHOLDER         \nRATIFICATION Our shareholders are being asked \nto ratify the appointment of PwC for 2023     \nbecause we value our shareholders\u2019 views on   \nour independent registered public accounting  \nfirm and as a matter of good corporate        \ngovernance. Representatives of PwC are        \nexpected to be present at the Annual Meeting, \nwill have an opportunity to make a statement  \nif they so desire and are expected to be      \navailable to respond to questions posed by    \nshareholders. If shareholders do not ratify   \nthe decision of the Audit Committee to        \nreappoint PwC as our independent registered   \npublic accounting firm for 2023, the Audit    \nCommittee will reconsider its decision.       \nHowever, in view of the difficulty and expense\ninvolved in changing auditors on short notice,\nshould shareholders not ratify the selection  \nof PwC, it is contemplated that the           \nappointment of PwC will be permitted to stand \nunless the Audit Committee finds other        \ncompelling reasons for making a change.       \nDisapproval by the shareholders will likely be\nconsidered a recommendation that the Audit    \nCommittee select another external auditor for \nthe following year.

Audit Committee Report The Audit   \nCommittee of the Board of Directors is        \ncurrently composed of eight independent       \ndirectors and operates under an amended and   \nrestated charter adopted by the Audit         \nCommittee on July 26, 2022. The SEC and the   \nNYSE have established standards relating to   \naudit committee membership and functions. With\nregard to such membership standards, the Board\nhas determined that Jennifer S. Banner, K.    \nDavid Boyer, Jr., Dallas S. Clement, Patrick  \nC. Graney III, Christine Sears, Bruce L.      \nTanner and Steven C. Voorhees meet the        \nrequirements of an \u201caudit committee financial \nexpert\u201d as defined by the SEC. The primary    \nduties and responsibilities of the Audit      \nCommittee are to assist the Board of Directors\nin monitoring: (i) the integrity of the       \nfinancial statements of the Company; (ii)     \ncompliance by the Company with legal and      \nregulatory requirements; (iii) the independent\nregistered public accounting firm\u2019s           \nqualifications and independence; (iv) the     \nCompany\u2019s internal controls and procedures;   \nand (v) the performance of the Company\u2019s      \ninternal audit function and the Company\u2019s     \nindependent auditors. While the Audit         \nCommittee has the duties and responsibilities \nset forth above and those set forth in its    \ncharter, our management is responsible for the\ninternal controls and the financial reporting \nprocess, and the independent registered public\naccounting firm is responsible for performing \nan integrated audit of our financial          \nstatements and of the effectiveness of our    \ninternal control over financial reporting in  \naccordance with standards established by the  \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and \nissuing a report thereon. In the performance  \nof its oversight function, the Audit Committee\nhas performed the duties required by its      \ncharter, including meeting and holding        \ndiscussions with management, the independent  \nregistered public accounting firm and the     \ninternal auditor, and has reviewed and        \ndiscussed the audited consolidated financial  \nstatements with management and the independent\nregistered public accounting firm. The Audit  \nCommittee has also discussed with the         \nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nthe matters required to be discussed by the   \napplicable requirements of the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board and the SEC. In    \naddition, the Audit Committee discussed with  \nthe independent registered public accounting  \nfirm its views on fraud risks and how it      \ndemonstrates its independence. The Audit      \nCommittee has received the written disclosures\nand the letters from the independent          \nregistered public accounting firm required by \napplicable requirements of the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, as currently in   \neffect, regarding the independent registered  \npublic accounting firm\u2019s communications with  \nthe Audit Committee concerning independence,  \nand the Audit Committee has discussed with the\nindependent registered public accounting firm \nits independence with respect to the Company. \nThe Audit Committee also has considered       \nwhether the provision of any non-auditservices\nby the independent registered public          \naccounting firm is compatible with maintaining\nthe independence of the auditors. Based upon a\nreview of the reports by, and discussions     \nwith, management and the independent          \nregistered public accounting firm, and the    \nAudit Committee\u2019s review of the               \nrepresentations of management and the Report  \nof the Independent Registered Public          \nAccounting Firm, the Audit Committee          \nrecommended on February 27, 2023 to the Board \nof Directors that the audited financial       \nstatements be included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2022,\nfiled with the SEC on February 28, 2023.      \nSubmitted by the Audit Committee of the Truist\nBoard of Directors as of February 27, 2023:   \n                                              \n  Dallas S.

The Compensation and    \nHuman Capital Committee and the Board believe \nthat our executive compensation program, as   \ndescribed in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and \nAnalysis,\u201d reflects a pay-for-                \nperformanceculture at Truist that is rooted in\nour values. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and the Board believe that the      \nexecutive compensation program is well        \ndesigned and effective in aligning the        \ninterests of the executives with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders, while          \nminimizing incentives for unnecessary and     \nexcessive risk taking. We hold this advisory  \nvote to approve our executive compensation    \nprogram annually, and Proposal 4 consists of  \nan advisory vote regarding the frequency of   \nthese votes on our executive compensation     \nprogram. In making a decision on whether to   \napprove our pay practices for our named       \nexecutive officers, we ask that you consider  \nthe description of our executive compensation \nprogram provided in the following pages in the\n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis,\u201d the   \ncompensation tables and the accompanying      \nnarratives. The Board strongly supports our   \nexecutive pay practices and asks shareholders \nto support our executive compensation program \nthrough the following resolution: \u201cResolved,  \nthat the shareholders approve the compensation\npaid to Truist\u2019s named executive officers, as \ndescribed in the Compensation Discussion and  \nAnalysis, the compensation tables and the     \nrelated narrative disclosures in the Company\u2019s\n2023 Proxy Statement.\u201d Your vote on this      \nproposal, which is required by Section 14A of \nthe Exchange Act, is \u201cadvisory\u201d and will serve\nas a non-bindingrecommendation to the Board.  \nThe Compensation and Human Capital Committee  \nwill seriously consider the outcome of this   \nvote when determining future executive        \ncompensation arrangements.                    \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    47  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The      \nfollowing Compensation Discussion and Analysis\n(\u201cCD&A\u201d) discusses how, for 2022, we          \ncompensated our named executive officers,     \nwhich include the Chief Executive Officer     \n(\u201cCEO\u201d), the Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d)  \nand each of the other executive officers named\nin the 2022 Summary Compensation Table (the   \n\u201cNamed Executive Officers\u201d or \u201cNEOs\u201d).

compensation program       \nremained largely the same as its 2021 and 2020\ncompensation program, which was implemented   \nfollowing the merger of equals that created   \nTruist. Highlights of the compensation program\nare summarized below. Further details on 2022 \nresults and pay decisions are provided in     \nSection 3 below. Base Salaries\u2013 Aligned with  \norganizational roles and market pay Base      \nsalaries provide the foundational component of\nexecutive pay and reflect each executive\u2019s    \nposition and responsibilities as well as      \nconsideration of market pay practices.        \nFollowing a review of competitive market data \nprovided by our independent compensation      \nconsultant, the Committee approved base       \nsalaries for the leadership team, including   \nthe NEOs, and adjusted salaries for certain   \nNEOs during the year based on changes in roles\nand responsibilities.                         \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    51  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Annual   \nIncentive Performance Award\u2013 Rewards annual   \nperformance goals tied to strategic plan The  \nAIP award program was developed to motivate   \nand reward financial performance and strategic\ninitiatives that define our success. The      \nprogram includes a combination of absolute and\nrelative financial performance as well as a   \nqualitative assessment of performance on      \nstrategic priorities and other critical       \nfactors of our success, as evaluated by the   \nCommittee. Absolute Earnings Per Share (\u201cEPS\u201d)\nand Relative Return on Average Assets (\u201cROAA\u201d)\nwere selected to measure growth, profitability\nand our return on investment. The Committee   \nbelieves these metrics have a meaningful      \nbearing on long-term increases in shareholder \nreturns and are valuable barometers of our    \nperformance. The EPS and ROAA performance     \npresented in this CD&A include adjustments to \nTruist\u2019s GAAP net income by the Committee. As \nsuch, the terms \u201cEPS\u201d and \u201cROAA\u201d used in this \nCD&A refer to these as-adjustedvalues.        \nAccordingly, the as-adjustedEPS and ROAA      \nvalues used for compensation purposes, and    \nwhich are discussed in this CD&A, differ from \nthose identified in the Financial Performance \nHighlights above. For additional detail       \nregarding these adjustments and the non-      \nadjustedversions of EPS and ROAA, and the     \ncalculation of EPS and ROAA, please refer to  \nAnnex A. The AIP award also includes a        \nqualitative assessment component that can be  \nearned if threshold performance is met for    \neither EPS or ROAA. While the primary focus is\non profitability and returns to our           \nshareholders, the Committee also believes our \nannual incentive payouts should include a     \nholistic review of our performance that       \nincludes results on our qualitative factors.  \nThe Committee reviews the key strategic       \nfactors that form the qualitative assessment  \neach year, making changes as appropriate. For \ninstance, ESG and DEI were added as factors in\nthe qualitative assessment for 2021 and       \nremained factors for 2022, reflecting the     \nincreased focus on these matters within the   \nCompany and by our shareholders. Payout on EPS\nor ROAA is not dependent on meeting the other \nmeasure first; each measure is scored         \nindependently and the results are then        \ncombined. If threshold performance is met for \neither EPS or ROAA, points awarded by the     \nCommittee for qualitative performance are then\nadded to the combined EPS and ROAA score. The \nCommittee can adjust the AIP payout due to    \nunanticipated circumstances, market conditions\nor negative risk outcomes. Long-Term Incentive\nProgram\u2013 Rewards future performance aligned   \nwith our shareholders The long-term incentive \nprogram is intended to provide a significant  \nportion of executive pay opportunity based on \nour future performance and value creation to  \nour shareholders. Under this program, 65% of  \nthe long-term incentive opportunity is at risk\nbased purely on our performance (40% as PSU   \nawards and 25% as a cash LTIP), and the       \nremainder is provided through time-based RSUs,\nwhich are subject to forfeiture if the        \nperformance criteria are not met. The value of\nthe cash LTIP and PSUs is based on three-year \nperformance with respect to the following     \nmetrics: Once an absolute minimum level of an \naverage Return on Average Tangible Common     \nEquity (\u201cROATCE\u201d) over the three-year         \nperformance period is achieved ( \u22657%), vesting\nof the PSUs and LTIP cash are based on our    \nReturn on Average Common Equity (\u201cROACE\u201d) and \nROATCE performance relative to our peers.     \nThese metrics were selected by the Committee  \nto reward performance viewed as important by  \nour shareholders, and to motivate strong      \nprofitability that ultimately drives favorable\nshareholder returns.                          \n                                 \n  52    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The ROACE\nand ROATCE performance presented in this CD&A \ninclude adjustments to Truist\u2019s GAAP net      \nincome by the Committee. As such, the terms   \n\u201cROACE\u201d and \u201cROATCE\u201d used in this CD&A refer  \nto these as-adjustedvalues. Accordingly, the  \nas-adjustedROACE and ROATCE values used for   \ncompensation purposes, and which are discussed\nin this CD&A, differ from those identified in \nthe Financial Performance Highlights above.   \nFor additional detail regarding these         \nadjustments and the non-adjustedversions of   \nROACE and ROATCE, and the calculation of ROACE\nand ROATCE, please refer to Annex A.

Committee approved the  \nfollowing changes to the executive            \ncompensation program. These enhancements will \nbe effective beginning with the 2023 calendar \nyear and are designed to (i) increase the     \nfocus on profitable growth, (ii) better align \nthe program\u2019s performance metrics with the key\nperformance indicators that drive Total       \nShareholder Return (\u201cTSR\u201d), and (iii) set a   \nhigher performance bar for the vesting and    \npayout of incentive compensation awards to our\nexecutives. Collectively, the metrics         \nrepresent a balanced scorecard of growth,     \nprofitability, and capital allocation. AIP:   \nEPS will remain as a component, but its       \nweighting will be reduced to 40% of the       \noverall award. Relative ROAA will no longer be\nused as a performance metric, as there is     \nlimited performance sensitivity relative to   \npeers given the Company\u2019s business mix, and   \nwill be replaced by absolute pre-provisionnet \nrevenue (\u201cPPNR\u201d), which will also be weighted \nat 40% of the overall award. Truist\u2019s results \non these metrics will be subject to potential \nmodifier (+/- up to 15%) based on the         \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of our performance     \nrelative to peers, market conditions, and     \nother factors deemed to be relevant by the    \nCommittee. This optional modifier will give   \nthe Committee an opportunity to evaluate the  \nimpact of any unplanned market factors on a   \nqualitative basis. The 2023 AIP award will    \ncontinue to include a qualitative component to\nassess progress on strategic priorities       \n(maintaining the current weighting of 20%)    \nthat can be earned if threshold performance is\nmet for either EPS or PPNR. Long-term         \nIncentives: 65% of the long-term incentive    \nwill remain at risk based purely on our       \nperformance (40% as PSU awards and 25% as cash\nLTIP awards), and the remainder will continue \nto be provided through time-based RSUs, which \nare subject to forfeiture if the performance  \ncriteria are not met. The value of the cash   \nLTIP and PSUs will now be based on three-year \nperformance with respect to Truist\u2019s ROACE    \nrelative to the peer group (weighted at 100%) \nwith a relative TSR modifier that will        \nincrease the payout by 20% if Truist\u2019s TSR is \nin the top quartile of the peer group for the \nperformance period and reduce the payout by   \n20% if Truist\u2019s TSR is in the bottom quartile \nof the peer group for the performance period. \nAn absolute minimum level of ROACE must be    \nachieved ( \u22657%) before any of the PSUs will   \nvest or LTIP cash will become payable.        \nTruist\u2019s ROATCE relative to the peer group    \nwill no longer be used as a performance metric\nfor the PSUs or LTIP cash awards as there is  \nlimited performance sensitivity relative to   \npeers given the Company\u2019s business mix.       \n                                 \n  54    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Section  \n2\u2014Executive Compensation Philosophy and       \nProgram Elements Compensation Philosophy Our  \noverall executive compensation program        \nemphasizes long-term, performance-based       \ncompensation, centered on the following key   \ntenets:                                       \n                                              \n     Compensation and reward systems are      \n     designed to reward performance, to       \n  \u2022  support and drive our strategic          \n     objectives, and to produce positive      \n     business results over the longer term;

In 2022, our executive  \ncompensation program for our NEOs received    \napproximately 94% approval by the Company\u2019s   \nshareholders. The Committee considered these  \nresults in applying the same compensation     \nprinciples and adhering to the core plan      \ndesign, allowing for a balance between short  \nand long-term incentives. 2022 Pay Program Mix\nThe significant majority of our executive pay \nprogram is performance-based. Approximately   \n92% of our CEO\u2019s target pay is based on the   \nCompany\u2019s performance and approximately 67% is\nbased on the Company\u2019s long-term performance. \nThe following charts illustrate target annual \ncompensation for our CEO, Mr. Rogers, and the \naverage target annual compensation for Messrs.\nCummins, Starnes, Maguire, and Wilson. Such   \ncompensation consists of base salary and      \ntarget levels of AIP, PSU, LTIP, and RSU      \nawards. The charts also show the large        \npercentage of our NEO compensation that is    \nvariable and performance-based.* * Reflects   \nexecutive compensation structure in place for \nactive NEOs as of December 31, 2022.          \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    55  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis          \n                                              \n                PERFORMANCE-\u2026                 \n                COMPONENTS                    \n                               Long-Term      \n                               Incentives     \n                               Performance    \n                               Metrics \u00a0 PSU  \n                               and LTIP       \n                               Awards \u00a0       \n                               Threshold      \n                               Return on      \n                               Average        \n                               Tangible       \n                               Common Equity  \n  Annual                       Requirement    \n  Incentive                    Relative\u00a0      \n  Performance                  Return\u00a0on\u00a0     \n  Award                        Average\u00a0       \n  Performance                  Tangible\u00a0      \n  Metrics                      Common\u00a0Equity  \n  Absolute EPS                 (50%)          \n  (50%)                        Relative       \n  Relative                     Return on      \n  ROAA (30%)                   Average        \n  Qualitative                  Common Equity  \n  Assessment                   (50%) \u00a0 PSU,   \n  (20%)                        LTIP and RSU   \n                               Awards \u00a0       \n                               Subject to     \n                               reduction or   \n                               forfeiture in  \n                               the event of   \n                               an annual      \n                               operating      \n                               loss or a      \n                               significant    \n                               negative risk  \n                               outcome        \n                                              \n                                 \n  56    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis 2022     \nExecutive Compensation Program Elements Our   \nexecutive compensation program is heavily     \nperformance-based, with base salary           \nrepresenting the only fixed element.

Starnes, Maguire,   \nand Wilson were increased, and Mr. Cummins\u2019   \nbase salary did not change, as a result of    \nexpanded leadership responsibilities.         \n                                              \n                          As\u00a0                 \n          Janu\u2026           Adju\u2026               \n          1,              in\u00a0                 \n          2022            2022                \n          Base            Base\u00a0               \n          Sala\u2026           Sala\u2026               \n  Name    ($)*            ($)                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Wil\u2026                                        \n  H.             1,20\u2026           1,20\u2026        \n  Rog\u2026                                        \n  Jr.                                         \n  Mic\u2026                                        \n  B.             525,\u2026           700,\u2026  **    \n  Mag\u2026                                        \n  Hugh                                        \n  S.             800,\u2026           800,\u2026        \n  Cum\u2026                                        \n  III                                         \n  Cla\u2026                                        \n  R.             740,\u2026           760,\u2026  **    \n  Sta\u2026                                        \n  III                                         \n  Don\u2026                                        \n  L.             600,\u2026           675,\u2026  ***   \n  Wil\u2026                                        \n  Dar\u2026                                        \n  N.             740,\u2026           740,\u2026  ****  \n  Bib\u2026                                        \n                                              \n* Effective January 1, 2022, for Messrs.      \nRogers, Maguire, Cummins, Starnes, Bible and  \nWilson, the January 1, 2022 base salaries     \nrepresent no increase from 2021. **Effective  \nSeptember 15, 2022, Messrs.

Annual Incentive  \nPerformance Award and Payouts Program Summary:\nThe AIP award program was approved by the     \nCommittee based on its review of market and   \nbest practices. The AIP award is a cash       \nincentive that rewards pre-definedfinancial   \nperformance (measured by EPS and ROAA) as well\nas a holistic, qualitative assessment of      \nperformance on strategic priorities. The AIP  \naward is based on the following three         \ncomponents and relative weightings, which the \nCommittee believes are appropriate measures of\nshort-term performance: The financial         \nperformance goals are established annually by \nthe Committee and include an EPS target goal  \nbased on our internal earnings plan and       \ncompares ROAA based on our performance        \nrelative to our peers. The qualitative        \ncomponent is based on the Committee\u2019s         \nassessment of the attainment of key strategic \npriorities based on criteria established by   \nthe Committee. While payouts based upon the   \nEPS component and the ROAA component are      \nindependent from one another, a payout under  \nthe qualitative performance component requires\nthe Company to meet threshold performance on  \neither the EPS component or the ROAA          \ncomponent. Payouts under each component of our\nAIP can range from 0% to 200% of the target   \naward opportunity. EPS interpolation used to  \nestablish awards is non-linearand the slope   \nincreases moving away from \u201cTarget\u201d towards   \nboth \u201cThreshold\u201d and \u201cMaximum\u201d. ROAA results  \nbetween \u201cThreshold\u201d, \u201cTarget\u201d and \u201cMaximum\u201d   \ngoals are subject to linear interpolation. Our\nNEOs have a target award opportunity for the  \nannual incentive expressed as a percentage of \nbase salary, which represents the amount of   \nAIP award received if executives achieve all  \nof the performance goals set by the Committee.\nThese targets were developed                  \n                                 \n  58    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis based on \ncompetitive benchmarking of market practices. \nIn 2022, as discussed above, the target AIP   \nawards were increased for Messrs.

Pay Decisions: After       \ncalculating the results for EPS and ROAA, the \nCommittee determined that threshold           \nperformance was met for each component. The   \nCommittee also considered whether adjustments \nto the financial results were needed due to   \noverly positive results based on unanticipated\ncircumstances and other factors and           \ndetermined, after its analysis, that          \nadjustments were necessary for 2022. The      \nCommittee concluded that due to several       \nfactors outside of the Company\u2019s control,     \nincluding favorable interest rate increases in\nexcess of the Company\u2019s forecast for 2022, the\nEPS component should be adjusted to more      \nappropriately capture the Company\u2019s core      \nperformance. As a result, the Committee       \nreduced net income to account for those       \nunusual economic conditions, including        \nfavorable interest rate increases in          \ncomparison to the Company\u2019s financial plan,   \nand to remove the effects of gains on the     \nearly extinguishment of debt and the sale of  \nbusinesses. The Committee also increased net  \nincome to remove the impact of losses on the  \nsale of securities, incremental operating     \nexpenses related to the merger and merger-    \nrelated and restructuring charges. Together,  \nthese adjustments resulted in a slight net    \nincrease in net income available to common    \nshareholders for purposes of determining      \nadjusted EPS in connection with the AIP       \nawards. Please see Annex Afor a further       \ndiscussion of the adjustments to EPS and ROAA.\nAfter making these adjustments and assessing  \nperformance based on the qualitative component\nof AIP, the Committee approved funding AIP    \nawards at 91% of target for each NEO. In      \nsummary, the AIP award payments to our NEOs   \nfor 2022 were as follows:                     \n                                              \n  Wi\u2026    Mic\u2026    Hugh    Cla\u2026    Don\u2026    Da\u2026  \n  H.

Several strategic priorities and \nother factors used by the Committee to assess \nqualitative performance in 2022 are set forth \nin the table below. For 2022, the Committee   \nassigned equal weight (20% of the overall     \nqualitative component) to each of the         \nfollowing categories of strategic priorities: \n(i) Environmental, Social and Governance, (ii)\nClient Experience/Integrated Relationship     \nManagement, (iii) Teammate Engagement and DEI,\n(iv) Financial Performance and Market Results,\nand (v) Other Strategic Priorities.           \nAccordingly, ESG and Teammate Engagement and  \nDEI accounted for 40% of the total qualitative\ncomponent and approximately 8% of the overall \ntarget AIP award. Based on its assessment of  \nTruist\u2019s results, the Committee determined    \nthat the qualitative component was earned at  \n55% of its target amount. In making its       \ndecision, the Committee recognized continued  \ngrowth and progress in the areas of ESG and   \nDEI reporting and initiatives and successful  \ncompletion of the merger integration          \nactivities in 2022 but also determined that   \nthere were opportunities for improvement in   \nseveral areas that warranted a payout of this \ncomponent below the target amount, including  \nTruist\u2019s TSR performance relative to peers,   \nelevated operating losses during the year,    \nprogress on goals for Integrated Relationship \nManagement, client experience and teammate    \nengagement results, and advancement on        \npayments capabilities and digitizing the      \nbusiness. In assessing performance on the ESG \ncategory, the Committee considered, among     \nother factors, (i) progress made on Truist\u2019s  \nESG objectives, including adding ESG expertise\nacross the enterprise, maintaining consistent \nESG ratings and rankings, and implementing    \nmore rigorous ESG reporting and disclosure    \nprotocols and internal controls, (ii)         \nannouncing a goal of net zero greenhouse gas  \nemissions by 2050 and progress made with      \nrespect to Truist\u2019s Scope 1 and 2 emissions   \nreduction goals, and (iii) achieving 100% of  \nour $60 billion Community Benefits Plan. In   \nassessing performance on the Teammate         \nEngagement and DEI category, the Committee    \nconsidered, among other things, our improved  \nretention of high performing teammates through\ncareer and leadership development and our     \ntotal rewards program and maintaining         \nethnically diverse representation above 15%   \nfor our senior leaders.

Awards provided as PSUs and under our \nLTIP program utilize the same metrics linking \npayouts to relative three-year ROACE and      \nROATCE performance. The Committee chose ROACE \nand ROATCE as the performance measures for the\nlong-term incentive awards based on the belief\nthat they provide a balanced view of returns  \ngenerated for shareholders. The inclusion of  \nROACE ensures that we earn strong returns on  \nthe capital deployed towards mergers and      \nacquisitions (which often result in an        \nincrease in goodwill and intangibles). The    \nROACE and ROATCE performance presented include\nadjustments to Truist\u2019s GAAP net income. For  \nadditional detail regarding these adjustments,\nplease refer to Annex A. The performance goals\nand payout range are established at the       \nbeginning of the cycle ( i.e., early 2022 for \nthe 2022-2024 performance period). LTIP awards\nhave historically been paid in cash, but at   \nthe discretion of the Committee, may be paid  \nin shares of Truist common stock, cash or     \nboth. LTIP awards settled in cash are paid as \na percentage of the executive\u2019s average salary\nover the three-year performance period.       \nDividends are not paid on unvested PSUs or    \ncalculated into LTIP payments.                \n                                 \n  62    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Pay      \nDecisions: For 2022, the Committee granted    \nPSUs and LTIP awards with the following       \nfeatures:                                     \n                                              \n2022-2024 PSU and LTIP Awards (Granted in 2022\nand Fully Vest/Payable in 2025) Performance   \nPeriod Three years Vesting Requirements and   \nForfeiture Provisions Three-year cliff vesting\nthrough March 15, 2025, with 100% of the award\nbeing subject to reduction or forfeiture if   \nthere is an aggregate operating loss for the  \nperformance period or if a significant        \nnegative risk outcome occurs as determined by \nthe Committee.

The Committee    \nbelieves that with the significant proportion \nof the NEOs\u2019 long-term incentive compensation \ncurrently consisting of equity, including the \nvesting of the PSUs from these awards, and in \nlight of the substantial Truist common stock  \nholdings of each of our NEOs, it was          \nappropriate to pay the 2020-2022 LTIP awards  \nin cash.                                      \n                                 \n  64    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis          \nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUs) RSUs complement \nother elements in our executive compensation  \nprogram and are designed to reward            \nsustainable, long-term appreciation of our    \nstock price over the vesting period and focus \non stock ownership and retention objectives.  \nPay Decisions: For 2022, the Committee granted\nRSUs with the following features: 2022 RSU    \nAwards Vesting Period The RSUs vest in 1/3    \nincrements over 4 years for all NEOs,         \nbeginning on March 15 following the second    \nanniversary of the grant date. Vesting        \nRequirements and Forfeiture Provisions The    \n2022 RSUs are subject to reduction or         \nforfeiture if Truist has incurred an annual   \noperating loss for the year or the Committee  \ndetermines that there has been a significant  \nnegative risk outcome as a result of a        \ncorporate or individual action. Dividend      \nTreatment Dividends are not paid on unvested  \nRSUs. ADDITIONAL AWARDS Vesting of Synergy    \nIncentive Awards: In connection with the      \nsignificant integration planning for the      \nmerger and the criticality of retaining key   \ntalent at both BB&T and SunTrust through the  \nintegration process, retention incentive      \nawards were granted to Messrs. Bible, Wilson, \nand Starnes prior to the closing of the merger\nin December 2019. The heritage BB&T           \nCompensation Committee granted one-time       \nawards(the \u201csynergy incentive awards\u201d)        \ndesigned to facilitate continuity and         \nretention of the executives responsible for   \ncritical roles and to reward the significant  \ntransition requirements of such a large       \nmerger. Pursuant to the terms of the synergy  \nincentive awards, 67% of the awards were paid \non January 31, 2022, in the amounts of        \n$2,073,600, $1,496,000, and $2,073,600 to     \nMessrs. Bible, Wilson, and Starnes,           \nrespectively. The initial 33% of the synergy  \nincentive awards were paid in August 2021.    \nIndividual Agreements MR. BIBLE\u2019S RETIREMENT  \nAND CONSULTING AGREEMENT On May 20, 2022,     \nTruist announced that Daryl N. Bible, Truist\u2019s\nCFO, would retire from Truist. Mr. Bible\u2019s    \nretirement was effective on November 30, 2022.\nIn connection with Mr. Bible\u2019s retirement,    \nTruist and Mr. Bible entered into a Retirement\nand Consulting Agreement (the \u201cBible          \nRetirement Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Mr. \nBible would provide consulting services to    \nsupport the transition of the CFO\u2019s           \nresponsibilities to his successor for a period\nof 12 months from Mr. Bible\u2019s retirement date \n(the \u201cConsulting Period\u201d). During the         \nConsulting Period, Mr. Bible will receive a   \nmonthly consulting fee of $125,000. Pursuant  \nto the terms of the Bible Retirement          \nAgreement, Mr. Bible\u2019s 2022 AIP award was     \nprorated for the period of the year he was    \nemployed through November 30, 2022. The AIP   \ncomponents of Mr. Bible\u2019s award were the same \nas for the awards to the other NEOs as        \ndiscussed above. On December 2, 2022, Mr.     \nBible informed Truist that he will voluntarily\nresign as a consultant prior to the end of the\nConsulting Period, effective May 31, 2023. As \na result of this voluntary termination of     \nconsulting services, Mr. Bible will not be    \nentitled to receive (i) the monthly consulting\nfees payable under the Bible Retirement       \nAgreement for any month following May 31,     \n2023, or (ii) the lump sum payment of         \n$2,750,000 payable at the conclusion of the   \nConsulting Period. In addition, Mr. Bible\u2019s   \nparticipation in Truist\u2019s health and welfare  \nbenefits will cease as of May 31, 2023. Mr.   \nBible\u2019s benefits under the agreement are more \nfully described below in \u201cPotential Payments  \nUpon Termination and Change of Control.\u201d      \nHISTORICAL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS In connection\nwith the merger with SunTrust, the heritage   \nBB&T employment agreements with each of       \nMessrs. Starnes and Bible were amended, in    \neach case, effective as of the closing of the \nmerger. In connection with the merger, Mr.    \nRogers entered into an employment agreement   \nthat became effective as of the closing of the\nmerger. While the employment agreements with  \nthe heritage BB&T NEOs originally had terms of\n36 months that automatically extended monthly \nby an additional month, effective March 1,    \n2019, we provided notice to each of these NEOs\nthat the employment agreement term would not  \nbe extended. As such, the employment agreement\nwith each heritage BB&T NEO expired on March  \n1, 2022. Mr. Rogers\u2019 employment agreement had \na term of three years from the date of        \ncompletion of the merger and expired on       \nDecember 6, 2022.                             \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    65  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Limited  \nPerquisites Our NEOs receive limited          \nperquisites and other personal benefits that  \nthe Committee believes are reasonable and     \nconsistent with our overall executive         \ncompensation program. Such perquisites        \ngenerally include, but are not limited to,    \nresidential security services, executive      \nphysical wellness examinations, occasional use\nof sports tickets, spousal participation in   \ncertain corporate events, and for the         \nindividual serving as our CEO, limited        \npersonal use of the company aircraft and      \ndriver. Our NEOs do not receive the following \nperquisites: corporate housing, personal club \nmemberships or automobile allowances. Teammate\nBenefits PENSION PLAN                         \n                                              \n     We provide the Truist Financial          \n     Corporation Pension Plan, a              \n     tax-qualified defined benefit            \n     retirement plan for eligible teammates   \n  \u2022  (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d). We are among the   \n     few remaining companies that offer a     \n     traditional pension plan for our         \n     teammates. This is a benefit we believe  \n     provides a competitive advantage for     \n     attracting and retaining talent.         \n                                              \n                                              \n     We also provide the Truist Financial     \n     Corporation Non-Qualified Defined        \n     Benefit Plan (the \u201cNon-Qualified         \n     Defined Benefit Plan\u201d) to augment the    \n     benefits payable under the Pension Plan  \n  \u2022  to the extent that such benefits are     \n     curtailed by application of certain tax  \n     limitations. The Committee believes      \n     that the benefits provided by the        \n     Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan       \n     ensure that we will maximize the         \n     retention benefits of the Pension Plan.  \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Pension Plan and the Non-Qualified   \n     Defined Benefit Plan are broad-based     \n  \u2022  benefits, and the NEOs participate in    \n     both plans on the same basis as other    \n     similarly situated teammates.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Pension Plan and the Non-Qualified   \n     Defined Benefit Plan provide retirement  \n     benefits based on length of service and  \n  \u2022  cash compensation level prior to         \n     retirement with benefits generally       \n     increasing substantially as a            \n     participant approaches retirement.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     We believe the retirement benefits       \n     provided by the Pension Plan are         \n  \u2022  meaningful to all teammates, but         \n     especially to those who have devoted     \n     substantial service to Truist.           \n                                              \nMoreover, we view the Pension Plan and the    \nNon-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan as important\nretention tools for the NEOs and other highly \ncompensated teammates. These retirement       \nbenefits could not easily be replicated upon  \nthe teammate\u2019s departure from Truist prior to \nretirement. The Committee believes that while \nthe overall retirement benefits provided to   \nthe NEOs are reasonable relative to those     \nprovided by its peer group, the Pension Plan  \nand Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan provide \nus with a competitive advantage in attracting \nand retaining talent in light of the high     \nnumber of companies that have frozen or       \nabandoned traditional pension plans in recent \nyears. BENEFIT PLANS During 2022, we          \nmaintained various teammate benefit plans that\nconstitute a portion of the total compensation\npackage available to the NEOs and all eligible\nteammates of Truist. These plans consist of   \nthe following:                                \n                                              \n     the Truist Financial Corporation 401(k)  \n     Savings Plan, which in 2022 permitted    \n     teammates to contribute up to 50% of     \n     their cash compensation, on a            \n  \u2022  tax-deferred, or after-tax basis,        \n     within certain IRS compensation          \n     deferral amount limits applicable to     \n     tax-qualified retirement plans, with     \n     Truist matching deferrals up to 6% of    \n     their compensation;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     the Truist Financial Corporation         \n     Non-Qualified Defined Contribution       \n     Plan, which is designed to augment the   \n     benefits under the Truist Financial      \n     Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan to the   \n     extent such benefits are curtailed by    \n     the application of certain limits        \n  \u2022  imposed by the Internal Revenue Code     \n     (during 2022, eligible participants in   \n     the Non-Qualified Defined Contribution   \n     Plan were permitted to defer up to 50%   \n     of their cash compensation with certain  \n     participants eligible to receive a       \n     matching contribution of up to 6% of     \n     their compensation);                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  a medical plan that provides coverage    \n     for all eligible teammates;              \n                                              \n                                              \n     disability insurance which, in the       \n     event of disability, pays a teammate     \n     50% of his or her monthly compensation,  \n     subject to a cap of $35,000 per month;   \n  \u2022  however, if the coverage percentage      \n     exceeds the monthly cap, we would        \n     provide supplemental payments to a       \n     member of Executive Leadership to bring  \n     the monthly payment up to the            \n     percentage coverage level; and           \n                                              \n                                              \n     certain other teammate benefits (such    \n  \u2022  as sick leave, vacation, dental and      \n     vision coverage, etc.).                  \n                                              \nThe teammate benefits for the NEOs discussed  \nin this subsection are determined by the same \ncriteria applicable to all of our teammates.  \nIn general, benefits are designed to provide a\nsafety net of protection against the financial\ncatastrophes that can result from illness,    \ndisability or death, and to provide a         \nreasonable level of retirement income based on\nyears of service with Truist. These benefits  \nare part of the strong value proposition we   \noffer our teammates in furtherance of our     \npurpose and help keep us competitive in       \nattracting and retaining teammates. We believe\nthat our teammate benefits are generally on   \npar with benefits provided by our peer group  \nand consistent with industry standards.       \n                                 \n  66    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Section  \n4\u2014Executive Compensation Process\u2014Decision     \nInputs and Roles Decision Making Calendar 2022\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROCESS \u2013 COMPENSATION \nAND HUMAN CAPITAL COMMITTEE                   \n                                              \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review executive risk  \n                    scorecard for the prior   \n                    year \u2022\u2002\u2009Receive reports   \n                    from the Chief Audit      \n                    Officer regarding risk    \n                    management and internal   \n                    control effectiveness \u2022\u2002  \n                    Approve financial         \n                    results and adjustments   \n                    for incentive plans \u2022\u2002\u2009   \n                    Determine                 \n                    payments/vesting for      \n                    incentive plans with      \n                    performance periods       \n  First Quarter     completed the prior year  \n                    (AIP, LTIP, PSUs and      \n                    RSUs) \u2022\u2002\u2009Approve peer     \n                    group for the current     \n                    year \u2022\u2002\u2009Set financial     \n                    targets and performance   \n                    measures for the current  \n                    year to determine AIP     \n                    awards, LTIP and PSUs \u2022\u2002  \n                    Set compensation for      \n                    current year \u2013 base       \n                    salary, short-term and    \n                    long-term incentive       \n                    targets \u2022\u2002\u2009Review tally   \n                    sheets                    \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review projected       \n  Second Quarter    financial results with    \n                    proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive plans           \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Conduct a\u00a0mid-year\u00a0    \n                    review of current         \n                    executive risk scorecard  \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review projected       \n                    financial results with    \n                    proposed adjustments for  \n  Third Quarter     incentive plans \u2022\u2002\u2009       \n                    Review of Executive       \n                    Leadership compensation   \n                    with the Committee\u2019s      \n                    independent compensation  \n                    consultant, Meridian      \n                    Compensation Partners,    \n                    LLC (\u201cMeridian\u201d)          \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review projected       \n                    financial results with    \n  Fourth Quarter    proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive plans \u2022\u2002\u2009       \n                    Conduct annual review of  \n                    director compensation     \n                                              \nPeer Group and Competitive Analyses The       \nCommittee uses a peer group to perform        \ncompetitive assessments of executive          \ncompensation as well as to measure performance\nunder our short- and long-term incentive      \nplans. The Committee approves a group of      \npublicly-traded banks or financial services   \nholding companies each year to serve as the   \npeer group. The Committee selected a peer     \ngroup in 2020 and has re-evaluated that peer  \ngroup on an annual basis since that time. The \nCommittee concluded that continued use of this\npeer group was appropriate for 2022. The      \nCommittee considered a number of factors,     \nincluding the industry, business mix, asset   \nsize, market capitalization and regulatory    \noversight. The Committee acknowledged the     \nchallenges of selecting peer companies as     \nTruist is among the largest regional banks in \nthe United States and there are only a few    \nother regional banks with substantially       \nsimilar characteristics. After discussion, the\nCommittee determined that the following       \ncompanies would continue to be used for       \ncompetitive pay benchmarking and to determine \nthe relative performance comparisons in our   \nshort- and long-term incentive awards.        \n                                              \n       TRU\u2026                                   \n       2022                                   \n       PEER                                   \n       GRO\u2026                                   \n               Ass\u2026             Ma\u2026           \n  Co\u2026          ($\u00a0              Ca\u2026           \n  Na\u2026          in\u00a0              ($            \n               bil\u2026             in            \n                                bi\u2026           \n  JP\u2026                $3,\u2026            $393     \n  Ch\u2026                                         \n  Ba\u2026                                         \n  of                 $3,\u2026            $266     \n  Am\u2026                                         \n  We\u2026                $1,\u2026            $157     \n  Fa\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                   $               $     \n  Ba\u2026                 675              67     \n  PNC                   $               $     \n  Fi\u2026                 557              64     \n  Tr\u2026                   $               $     \n  Fi\u2026                 555              57     \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  Ci\u2026                   $               $     \n  Fi\u2026                 227              19     \n  Fi\u2026                   $               $     \n  Th\u2026                 208              23     \n  M&T                   $               $     \n                      201              25     \n  Key                   $               $     \n  Co\u2026                 190              16     \n  Re\u2026                   $               $     \n                      155              20     \n  Tr\u2026                                         \n  Fi\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                  50  %           50  %  \n  pe\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n                                              \n* Data sourced from S&P Global Market         \nIntelligence as of December 31, 2022.         \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    67  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The      \ncompensation structure for Executive          \nLeadership, which includes the NEOs,          \nemphasizes variable pay based on performance. \nWe generally compare each element of          \ncompensation as well as total compensation    \nrelative to the peer group. In establishing   \ntarget pay opportunities, the Committee       \nreviews market data from our peers as well as \nother financial services firms. The Committee \nestablishes pay levels for each executive that\nare appropriate based on market data as well  \nas other critical factors including each      \nexecutive\u2019s specific role, performance,       \nexperience, expertise, internal pay           \ncomparisons and relative responsibilities of  \nthe Executive Leadership team. In addition to \nthe external peer group analysis, the         \nCommittee also reviews detailed tally sheets  \nfor each executive and compares the total     \ncompensation for each member of the Executive \nLeadership team relative to one another. This \npractice is consistent with our compensation  \nphilosophy of rewarding our teammates based   \nupon their level of responsibility within the \nCompany. Regulatory Considerations in Setting \nCompensation Banking regulators have provided \ninput on and influenced the compensation      \npractices and incentive compensation          \nstructures at the largest financial           \ninstitutions in the United States, focusing on\nthe risks intrinsic to the design and         \nimplementation of compensation plans as well  \nas the reasonableness of each element of      \ncompensation. Regulatory guidance is          \nconsidered in the design and implementation of\nour executive compensation programs. The      \nCommittee continues to assess our pay         \npractices to balance risks and meet           \nstakeholder expectations with our commitment  \nto link NEO pay to our performance while      \nmaintaining executive compensation programs   \nthat are market competitive and shareholder   \naligned.

At the beginning    \n     of each year, the Committee receives     \n     final performance information for the    \n  \u2022  prior year, and historically has made    \n     adjustments to our reported results      \n     (e.g., net income) to ensure that the    \n     applicable compensatory plans fairly     \n     compensate participants for core Truist  \n     performance.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Committee may also make adjustments  \n     to the reported performance of peer      \n  \u2022  group members for awards that measure    \n     our performance relative to the peer     \n     group.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     A reconciliation of adjustments that     \n  \u2022  the Committee made for the purposes of   \n     certifying 2022 performance is included  \n     in Annex\u00a0A to this proxy statement.      \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated, discussions of    \n2022 performance for compensation purposes in \nthis proxy statement include these adjustments\nmade by the Committee.                        \n                                 \n  68    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Role of  \nManagement in Compensation Decisions The      \nCommittee periodically receives reports from  \nour Chief Audit Officer, the head of our      \ninternal audit function, regarding our        \ninternal controls. The Committee also receives\nreports from our Chief Risk Officer on our    \nExecutive Risk Outcomes Assessment for the    \nCompany and individual executives. The purpose\nof these reports and review is to allow the   \nCommittee to evaluate our current risk        \nenvironment and internal control positions    \nrelevant to incentive compensation, and to    \ntake these issues into consideration when     \ndetermining incentive compensation. The CEO is\nalso involved in compensation determinations  \nfor members of Executive Leadership, other    \nthan himself, including compensation for each \nof the other NEOs, and makes recommendations  \nto the Committee on base salary and the other \ncompensation elements. We believe that the CEO\nis in the best position to assess the         \nperformance of other members of Executive     \nLeadership, and accordingly, he plays an      \nimportant role in the compensation setting    \nprocess for these executives. Ultimately,     \nhowever, decisions about individual           \ncompensation elements and total compensation  \nof all members of Executive Leadership are    \nmade by the Committee, based primarily on the \nexecutive\u2019s performance and our overall       \nperformance, with consideration of the        \nbusiness environment in which the results were\nachieved. In addition, the Risk Committee     \nprovides input with respect to and approves   \nthe compensation of the Chief Risk Officer,   \nand the Audit Committee provides input with   \nrespect to and approves the compensation of   \nthe Chief Audit Officer. Role of Compensation \nConsultant The Committee engages an           \nindependent compensation consultant to provide\nmarket reference perspective and serve as an  \nadvisor. The independent compensation         \nconsultant serves at the request of, and      \nreports directly to, the Committee. Further,  \nthe Committee has the sole authority to       \napprove the independent compensation          \nconsultant\u2019s fees and other retention terms,  \nincluding the authority to limit the amount of\nfees the independent compensation consultant  \nmay earn from other services provided to      \nTruist. The Committee has retained Meridian to\nact as the Committee\u2019s independent            \ncompensation consultant. In this capacity,    \nMeridian performed a review of our executive  \ncompensation programs, provided peer group    \nanalyses, and advised on regulatory           \ndevelopments, corporate governance and best   \npractice trends. The Committee determined     \nthat, based on its review, Meridian is        \nindependent and that its engagement did not   \npresent any conflicts of interest. In making  \nthis determination, the Committee noted that  \nMeridian (i) provides no services to Truist   \nother than compensation consulting, (ii) has  \nno personal or business relationships with    \nmembers of our Board or executive officers,   \n(iii) does not directly own any shares of     \nTruist stock, and (iv) retains a written      \npolicy designed to avoid conflicts of interest\nthat may arise. Meridian also determined that \nit was independent from our management and    \nconfirmed this in a written statement provided\nto the Chair of the Committee. During 2022,   \nthe compensation consultant provided the      \nfollowing services to the Committee:          \n                                              \n     reviewed our Company\u2019s total             \n  \u2022  compensation philosophy for              \n     reasonableness and appropriateness;      \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u2022  reviewed overall compensation levels;  \n                                            \n                                              \n     reviewed our total executive             \n     compensation program relative to peers   \n  \u2022  and advised the Committee of plans or    \n     practices that may be changed to         \n     improve effectiveness;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     provided market and peer data and        \n  \u2022  recommendations on Executive Leadership  \n     compensation;                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  reviewed and advised the Committee on    \n     the composition of our peer group;       \n                                              \n                                              \n     reviewed public disclosure on            \n     compensation, including the draft CD&A   \n  \u2022  and related tables and compensation      \n     disclosures for our proxy statement;     \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  advised the Committee regarding the      \n     compensation of outside directors.       \n                                              \nIn order for a compensation consultant to     \nprovide effective advice, the Committee       \nexpects them to interact with our management  \nfrom time to time. These interactions         \ngenerally involve, among other things:        \n                                              \n     obtaining compensation and benefits      \n  \u2022  data, as well as other relevant          \n     information that is not available from   \n     public sources;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     working with management to understand    \n  \u2022  the scope of the various executive jobs  \n     in order to provide accurate             \n     benchmarking; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     conferring with management to ensure     \n  \u2022  advice is grounded in our business       \n     strategy and circumstances.              \n                                              \nThis process enables the compensation         \nconsultant to identify any areas where further\nresearch or analysis may be necessary, while  \nallowing it to discuss any changes to the     \nexecutive compensation program or refine      \nrecommendations before finalizing its reports \nto the Committee.                             \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    69  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis EXECUTIVE\nRISK SCORECARD/RISK ADJUSTMENTS We utilize an \nexecutive risk scorecard, which the Committee \nmay use to adjust, if necessary, the short-   \nterm and long-term incentive compensation of  \neach member of Executive Leadership (including\nthe NEOs). The executive risk scorecard:      \n                                              \n     allows for evaluation of both corporate  \n  \u2022  and individual results that can be       \n     compared to stated risk appetites in     \n     all risk categories;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     presents the positive and negative risk  \n     outcomes that have influenced each risk  \n  \u2022  category, if necessary, and includes     \n     recommended actions with respect to      \n     significant negative outcomes;           \n                                              \n                                              \n     is used in conjunction with the          \n  \u2022  recommendations of the Chief Risk        \n     Officer, the CEO and the Committee\u2019s     \n     own insight and evaluation;              \n                                              \n                                              \n     is included as part of our risk review   \n     process in which 100% of each Executive  \n  \u2022  Leader\u2019s short-term and long-term        \n     incentive compensation for 2022 was      \n     subject to potential adjustment; and     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  is reviewed by the independent           \n     compensation consultant.                 \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the executive risk\nscorecard is an important element to ensure   \nthat incentive compensation at the Executive  \nLeadership level is risk-balanced. The use of \nthis risk scorecard has been discussed with   \nour regulators as an additional way to conform\nto incentive compensation guidance and best   \npractices. Section 5\u2014Other Compensation and   \nBenefits Policies and Practices In addition to\nthe key components of our executive           \ncompensation program described above, other   \nsignificant policies, plans and factors       \ninfluence executive compensation, including   \nthe compensation of the NEOs. These policies  \nand practices ensure strong governance of our \nexecutive compensation program and promote    \nalignment of our executives\u2019 interests with   \nthose of shareholders. Compensation Practices \nand the Impact on Risk Management We expect   \nall members of our Executive Leadership team  \nto exhibit the highest levels of ethics and   \ndemonstrate best practices to discourage      \nunnecessary or excessive risk taking when     \nconducting activities on behalf of Truist. The\nCommittee annually considers whether our      \nexecutive compensation program encourages     \nunnecessary or excessive risk taking. In      \nreviewing the program for risk, the goal of   \nthe Committee is to design an executive       \ncompensation program to encourage prudent risk\nmanagement and discourage inappropriate risk- \ntaking by granting a diverse portfolio of     \ncompensation to our NEOs that is expected to  \nreward the creation of shareholder value over \ntime. When determining incentive compensation,\nand consistent with regulatory guidance, the  \nCommittee evaluates our current risk          \nenvironment and internal control structure    \nrelevant to incentive compensation and reviews\nan executive risk scorecard and other reports.\nThe Committee also receives reports from our  \nChief Audit Officer, the head of Truist\u2019s     \ninternal audit function, regarding the        \neffectiveness of our overall system of        \ninternal controls. BALANCE BETWEEN SHORT- AND \nLONG-TERM COMPENSATION ELEMENTS The Committee \nbelieves that having market-competitive fixed \nbase salaries discourages inappropriate risk- \ntaking. In addition, executives have a        \nsignificant proportion of compensation        \nprovided in the form of equity awards, such as\nPSUs and RSUs that have performance and       \nvesting features that extend over several     \nyears. Additionally, LTIP awards are based on \nour performance over a three-year period,     \nencouraging our NEOs to focus on long-term    \nperformance, rather than just annual results, \nand further reducing risk-taking that is      \nlikely to produce only short-term benefits and\nallowing sufficient time for risk outcomes to \nemerge. USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT      \nADJUST FOR RISK To help encourage prudent risk\nmanagement, the Committee considers the risk  \nprofile of the primary compensation elements. \nUnder our incentive programs, we use          \nperformance metrics that closely correlate to \nshareholder return. Similarly, our incentive  \nprograms include measures that adjust for     \nrisk, including the use of the executive risk \nscorecard. CLAWBACK AND FORFEITURE PROVISIONS \nOur clawback and forfeiture provisions also   \ndiscourage imprudent risk-taking. Our 2022    \nIncentive Plan, which is the plan pursuant to \nwhich we now make all of our AIP, PSU, LTIP   \nand RSU awards, and related award agreements  \ncontain broad language regarding clawbacks and\nmake all awards under the 2022 Incentive Plan \nsubject to recoupment, forfeiture or reduction\nto the extent determined by the Committee, as \nnecessary to comply with applicable law or    \nTruist\u2019s policies. Our award agreements also  \nallow the Committee to adjust the terms and   \nconditions of the awards in recognition of    \ncertain events, including material restatement\nof our financial statements, to prevent       \ndilution or enlargement of benefits intended  \nto be made under the applicable plan. Our     \nBoard believes that the current structure of  \nTruist\u2019s incentive compensation recoupment    \npractices is appropriate, effective, provides \na balanced approach to risk management, and   \nproperly aligns the interests of our Executive\nLeadership and shareholders.                  \n                                 \n  70    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis STOCK    \nOWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS The Committee believes \nthat members of Executive Leadership,         \nincluding the NEOs, should accumulate         \nmeaningful equity stakes in Truist over time  \nto further align their economic interests with\nthe interests of shareholders, thereby        \npromoting our objective of increasing         \nshareholder value. We have robust stock       \nownership requirements to ensure that our     \nexecutives have significant value tied to     \nlong-term stock price performance which       \ndiscourages a focus on short-term results and \nimprudent risk-taking. In accordance with our \nCorporate Governance Guidelines, our CEO is   \nrequired to own Truist stock having a value   \nequal to at least 6x his base salary, while   \nall other members of Executive Leadership are \nrequired to own Truist stock having a value of\nat least 3x their base salary. The Corporate  \nGovernance Guidelines require the minimum     \nlevel of ownership to be met by the later of  \n(i) five years after initially joining        \nExecutive Leadership, or (ii) such period of  \ntime as it takes to reach the ownership       \nrequirement by continuously holding the shares\nor RSUs granted by Truist pursuant to its     \nequity compensation arrangements. Each member \nof Executive Leadership currently meets these \nrequirements as applicable to him or her      \n(whether by owning the required amount of     \nshares or still being within the grace period \nto achieve such ownership level). RESPONSIBLE \nEQUITY GRANT PRACTICES Generally, the timing  \nof our regular annual equity awards is        \ndetermined months in advance of the actual    \ngrants in order to coincide with the regularly\nscheduled February meetings of the Board and  \nthe Committee. The grant date is established  \nwhen the grants and all key terms are approved\nby the Board or the Committee, as the case may\nbe. For the 2022 PSU and RSU awards, the      \nCommittee used the closing price of our common\nstock on the grant date to determine the      \nnumber of PSU and RSU awards that were        \ngranted. In addition, the 2022 Incentive Plan \nincludes prohibitions on the repricing of     \nstock options without shareholder approval. We\nare required to recognize the expense of all  \nshare-based awards (such as PSUs and RSUs) in \nour income statement over the award\u2019s minimum \nrequired service period. Pledging and Hedging \nof Shares Our Code of Ethics prohibits all    \nteammates from speculative trading in Truist  \nsecurities (including prohibitions on short-  \nselling and trading put options). Our         \nSecurities Trades by Company Personnel Policy \nprohibits Section 16 reporting persons, which \ninclude directors and members of Executive    \nLeadership, from engaging in hedging          \ntransactions (including short sales, trading  \nin puts, calls, and other options or          \nderivatives). Teammates who are not Section 16\nreporting persons are prohibited from engaging\nin hedging transactions, other than           \ntransactions that hedge against an existing   \nlong position in Truist securities if the     \nshares underlying the position are readily    \navailable for sale or delivery and the        \nexercise or strike price of the hedge is above\nthe then-current market price of the shares.  \nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit  \nthe pledging of Truist shares by directors and\nmembers of Executive Leadership. Currently,   \nnone of our directors or Executive Leadership \nmembers hold Truist shares that are subject to\npledges or hedges. Tax Considerations Prior to\n2018, our compensation philosophy and policies\nwere intended to comply with Section 162(m) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, which generally    \ndisallowed a federal income tax deduction for \ncompensation over $1 million paid for any     \nfiscal year to the CEO and specified other    \nexecutive officers, subject to exceptions for \n\u201cperformance-based\u201d compensation. The Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) eliminated   \nthis exception for performance-based          \ncompensation, and the Company may no longer   \ntake an annual deduction for any compensation \npaid to any of its covered employees in excess\nof $1 million per executive officer with the  \nexception of remuneration grandfathered under \nthe Act. Due to the continued importance and  \nbenefit to the Company and our shareholders of\nawarding compensation that is structured to   \nproperly incentivize our executive officers,  \nthe Committee believes that it is in our best \ninterests to retain flexibility in awarding   \ncompensation, even if some awards may be non- \ndeductiblecompensation expenses to the        \nCompany. Compensation and Human Capital       \nCommittee Report on Executive Compensation The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee is   \ncomposed entirely of non-employeedirectors,   \neach of whom has been determined in the       \nBoard\u2019s business judgment to be independent   \nbased on the categorical standards for        \nindependence adopted by the Board, which      \ninclude applicable NYSE independence          \nstandards. The Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee is responsible for oversight and    \nreview of our compensation and benefit plans, \nincluding administering our executive         \nincentive plans, determining the compensation \nfor the CEO and reviewing and approving the   \ncompensation for the other members of         \nExecutive Leadership. The Compensation        \nDiscussion and Analysis section of this proxy \nstatement is management\u2019s report on Truist\u2019s  \nexecutive compensation program and, among     \nother things, explains the material elements  \nof the compensation paid to the CEO and the   \nother NEOs. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee has reviewed and discussed the      \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section  \nof this proxy statement with management. Based\non this review and discussion, the            \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee      \nrecommended on February 27, 2023 to the Board \nof Directors that the Compensation Discussion \nand Analysis be included in this proxy        \nstatement and incorporated by reference into  \nour Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year    \nended December 31, 2022.                      \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    71  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Submitted\nby the Compensation and Human Capital         \nCommittee of the Board of Directors as of     \nFebruary 27, 2023:                            \n                                              \n  Steven C.

Mr.\u00a0Wilson\u2019s April\u00a01, 2022  \n       PSUs were valued using the grant       \n       price of $55.33 less the present       \n       value of projected future dividends    \n       of $5.84, or $49.49, consistent with   \n       the approach for FASB ASC Topic 718    \n  (2)  expensing, and his April\u00a01, 2022 RSUs  \n       were valued using the grant price of   \n       $55.33 less the present value of       \n       future dividends of $5.83, or $49.50,  \n       consistent with the approach for FASB  \n       ASC Topic 718 expensing. At the        \n       maximum level of performance, the      \n       value of PSUs awarded in 2022 would    \n       be: $5,113,528 for Mr.\u00a0Rogers,         \n       $783,702 for Mr.\u00a0Maguire, $2,388,575   \n       for Mr.\u00a0Cummins, $1,606,842 for Mr.\u00a0   \n       Starnes, $1,205,978 for Mr.\u00a0Wilson     \n       and $1,606,842 for Mr.\u00a0Bible.

Fixed  \n     costs that do not change based on        \n     usage, such as pilot salaries,           \n     depreciation of aircraft, and            \n     maintenance costs, are not included in   \n     the calculation of variable operating    \n     cost.

For a        \ndiscussion of the valuation methods and       \nmaterial assumptions applied in quantifying   \nthe present value of the current accrued      \nbenefit under each of these plans, as set     \nforth in the table above, please refer to Note\n15 \u201cBenefit Plans\u201d in the \u201cNotes to           \nConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d included   \nwith the Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the    \nyear ended December 31, 2022, and filed with  \nthe SEC on February 28, 2023. A discussion of \neach of these plans is set forth below. Mr.   \nRogers participated in several plans assumed  \nin the merger of equals with SunTrust that    \ncreated Truist. Those plans have provisions   \nwhich differ from the Truist plans discussed  \nbelow. The Company merged the SunTrust        \nqualified pension plan into the Truist Pension\nPlan in 2020. Mr. Rogers and Mr. Cummins      \ncontinue to participate in the SunTrust ERISA \nExcess Plan, and Mr. Rogers continues to      \nparticipate in the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Tier 2\nSERP, although any future benefit accruals    \nwill come only from the Truist Pension Plan   \nand Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan as      \nbenefit accruals under these heritage SunTrust\nplans were frozen prior to the merger. Tax-   \nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan. The Pension    \nPlan is a tax-qualifieddefined benefit pension\nplan for eligible teammates. Most teammates of\nTruist and its subsidiaries who have attained \nage 21 are eligible to participate in the     \nPension Plan after completing one year of     \nservice. Our contributions to the Pension Plan\nare computed on an actuarial basis. No        \nparticipant contributions are permitted. A    \nparticipant\u2019s annual normal retirement benefit\nunder the Pension Plan at age 65 is an amount \nequal to 1.0% of the participant\u2019s final      \naverage compensation plus 0.5% of the         \nparticipant\u2019s final average compensation in   \nexcess of Social Security covered             \ncompensation, multiplied by the number of     \nyears of creditable service completed up to a \nmaximum of 35 years. A participant\u2019s final    \naverage compensation is his or her average    \nannual cash compensation, including salary,   \nwages, overtime, bonuses and incentive        \ncompensation, for the five consecutive years  \nin the last ten years in which he or she      \nreceives compensation that produces the       \nhighest average.                              \n                                 \n  78    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers Non-       \nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan.The Non-        \nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan is an excess    \nbenefit plan designed to provide supplemental \npension benefits for certain highly           \ncompensated teammates, including the NEOs, to \nthe extent that their benefits under the      \nPension Plan are curtailed due to IRS         \ncompensation and benefit limitations. Benefits\nunder the Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan   \nare included in the table above.              \nRetirement.Messrs. Rogers, Cummins, Starnes   \nand Bible meet or have met the requirements   \nfor retirement under the Pension Plan and the \nNon-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan. While the  \ngeneral retirement age is 65, teammates with  \nat least 10 years of service who have attained\nage 55 are eligible to retire and begin       \nreceiving a reduced pension immediately. If a \nteammate begins pension payments prior to the \nnormal retirement age of 65, the payments are \nreduced based on a plan-specified reduction   \nschedule ranging from receipt of 50% at age   \n55, increasing until reaching 98% at age 64,  \nwith the increases weighted more heavily      \ntoward the earlier years. Generally, pension  \nbenefits under each plan are paid to          \nqualifying participants in the form of a life \nannuity for non-marriedparticipants and a     \njoint and 50% survivor annuity for married    \nparticipants. 2022 Non-QualifiedDeferred      \nCompensation                                  \n                                              \n        Ex\u2026    Tr\u2026    Agg\u2026       Ag\u2026    Agg\u2026  \n        Co\u2026    Co\u2026    Ear\u2026       Wi\u2026    Bal\u2026  \n  N\u2026     in     in      in       Di\u2026      at  \n        20\u2026    20\u2026    2022       ($)    12/\u2026  \n        ($\u2026    ($\u2026    ($)\u2026              ($)\u2026  \n  W\u2026                                          \n  H.    31\u2026    31\u2026    (1,\u2026  )    \u2014      6,1\u2026  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  J\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  B.    87\u2026    81\u2026    (42\u2026  )    \u2014      310\u2026  \n  M\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026                                          \n  S.    56\u2026    17\u2026    (75\u2026  )    \u2014      4,2\u2026  \n  C\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  R.    36\u2026    30\u2026    30,\u2026       \u2014      4,1\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  L.    21\u2026    21\u2026    (12\u2026  )    \u2014      1,0\u2026  \n  W\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  N.    32\u2026    30\u2026    (84\u2026  )    \u2014      6,1\u2026  \n  B\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n         Executive contributions were based   \n         on each NEO\u2019s deferral elections     \n  (1)    and the salaries, Annual Incentive   \n         Performance award and LTIP payments  \n         received by each NEO in 2022.        \n                                              \n                                              \n         This column represents Truist\u2019s      \n         matching contributions credited to   \n         the accounts of the NEOs during      \n  (2)    2022 in respect of the NEO\u2019s         \n         contributions.

During 2022, eligible teammates  \nwere permitted to defer up to 50% of their    \ncash compensation under the Non-              \nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan, with      \ncertain participants, including each NEO,     \neligible to receive a matching contribution up\nto 6% of his or her compensation. All cash    \ncompensation is eligible for deferral unless  \nprohibited under Internal Revenue Code Section\n409A. Plan participants may select deemed     \ninvestment funds under the Non-               \nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan that are   \nidentical to the investment funds offered     \nunder the 401(k) Plan with the exception that \nno deemed investments in Truist common stock  \nare permitted. Participants make an election  \nupon entering the Non-QualifiedDefined        \nContribution Plan regarding the timing of plan\ndistributions. The two allowable distribution \nelections are distribution upon termination or\ndistribution based on a selected age following\ntermination not to exceed age 65. The Non-    \nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan also allows\nfor an in-servicehardship withdrawal based on \nfacts and circumstances that meet IRS         \nguidelines. The Non-QualifiedDefined          \nContribution Plan also provides participants  \nin our incentive compensation plans with an   \neffective means of electing to defer, on a    \npre-taxbasis, a portion of the payments that  \nthey are entitled to receive under such plans.\n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    79  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers Potential  \nPayments Upon Termination or Change of Control\nThe potential payments to the NEOs pursuant to\nexisting plans and arrangements in the event  \nof their termination or a change of control at\nDecember 31, 2022 are shown in the table      \nbelow.

The amounts for    \n         these NEOs reflect fiscal year 2022  \n         actual Annual Incentive Performance  \n         award payouts as the table assumes   \n         termination on December\u00a031, 2022.    \n                                              \n                                              \n         Following termination due to         \n         retirement, death, disability, or    \n         other than for just cause or good    \n         reason, LTIP and PSU awards remain   \n         subject to the Company\u2019s actual      \n         performance. Therefore, we have      \n         calculated these amounts using       \n         actual performance for the 2020      \n         LTIP and PSU awards and an           \n         assumption of target performance     \n         for both the 2021 and 2022 LTIP and  \n         PSU awards. However, these are       \n         forward-looking statements that may  \n         not be representative of actual      \n         performance. For these scenarios,    \n         the amounts include for the 2021     \n         and 2022 LTIP and PSU awards         \n         pro-rated numbers reflecting a       \n         termination date of December\u00a031,     \n         2022. Following a change of          \n         control, the NEO is entitled to      \n         LTIP payments prorated through the   \n         date of the change of control. The   \n  (2)    amounts shown above include actual   \n         payments for the 2020-2022 LTIP      \n         cycle and projected pro rata         \n         payments for the two outstanding     \n         three-year LTIP cycles that have     \n         not been completed as of December\u00a0   \n         31, 2022, assuming that the          \n         Company\u2019s performance criteria are   \n         met at 100% of the NEO\u2019s target      \n         opportunity and such payment being   \n         prorated through the date of the     \n         change of control (assumed to be     \n         December\u00a031, 2022 for purposes of    \n         this table). Following a change of   \n         control, the NEO is entitled to PSU  \n         payments, with performance based on  \n         actual results for the completed     \n         calendar year(s) and target          \n         performance assumed for the          \n         remaining uncompleted calendar       \n         year(s).

In the event of the death or         \ndisability, and subsequent termination, of any\nNEO, the Company and Truist Bank will use     \ntheir best efforts to accelerate vesting of   \nany unvested benefits to which the NEO may be \nentitled under any stock-based or other       \nbenefit plan or arrangement to the extent     \npermitted by the terms of such plans. The     \nSeverance Plan also includes a non-           \ncompetitionobligation and an obligation not to\nsolicit Truist teammates or clients, each     \nobligation continuing for 12 consecutive      \nmonths after the date of the NEO\u2019s termination\nof employment. These prohibitions generally   \npreclude the NEO from working for a direct    \ncompetitor providing banking or financial     \nproducts or services within the continental   \nUnited States. Additionally, the Severance    \nPlan prohibits the executive from soliciting  \nor assisting in the solicitation of any       \nrecipient of the Company\u2019s banking or         \nfinancial products or services and other      \nCompany clients or inducing any of our        \nteammates to terminate their employment with  \nthe Company or its affiliates. The Severance  \nPlan provides for reductions in payments to   \nthe extent necessary to avoid exceeding the   \nlimits established by Section 280G of the     \nInternal Revenue Code. Payments in excess of  \nthese limits are often referred to as \u201cexcess \nparachute payments,\u201d and exceeding the Section\n280G limits generally triggers an excise tax  \non the payments. Under the Severance Plan, if \ntermination payments and benefits to be       \nprovided (along with any other payments and   \nbenefits available to the NEO) will constitute\nan excess parachute payment, then the payments\nwill be reduced to an amount that is $1.00    \nless than the amount that would cause the     \npayments to be an excess parachute payment;   \nprovided, however, that such a reduction will \nonly be imposed if the reduction results in a \ngreater after-taxbenefit to the NEO than if   \nsuch payments had not been reduced.

Bible On May 20, 2022, Truist        \nannounced that Mr. Bible would retire from his\nposition as CFO at Truist. His retirement was \neffective as of November 30, 2022. In         \nconnection with his retirement, Mr. Bible and \nTruist entered into a Retirement and          \nConsulting Agreement, dated June 2, 2022 (the \n\u201cBible Retirement Agreement\u201d), pursuant to    \nwhich Mr. Bible is entitled to receive certain\nbenefits in connection with his retirement and\nagreed to provide certain consulting services \nto assist with the transition of CFO duties to\nhis successor for a period of one year from   \nhis retirement date (the \u201cConsulting Period\u201d).\nThe agreement provided for Mr. Bible to       \nreceive a monthly fee in exchange for his     \nconsulting services through the end of the    \nConsulting Period, as well as his continued   \nparticipation in our medical benefit plans.   \nDue to Mr. Bible\u2019s actual retirement from     \nTruist and the separation pay benefits agreed \nto under the Bible Retirement Agreement, he   \nwas not entitled to participate in the        \nSeverance Plan, and the above discussion      \nregarding the benefits of the NEOs under the  \nSeverance Plan is not applicable to Mr. Bible.\nPursuant to the Bible Retirement Agreement,   \nMr. Bible was entitled to receive the         \nfollowing in connection with his retirement on\nNovember 30, 2022, subject to his execution   \nand non-revocationof the Bible Retirement     \nAgreement (including a general release and    \nreaffirmation of the provisions therein), as  \nwell as his compliance with non-              \nsolicitationand non-competitionprovisions: (i)\na pro-ratedAIP payment for 2022 based on his  \nretirement date of November 30, 2022, (ii) a  \nlump sum cash payment of $2,750,000 payable   \nwithin 30 days after the conclusion of the    \nConsulting Period and payment of the last     \nmonthly consulting fee, and (iii) 24 months of\ncontinued health and welfare benefits. Mr.    \nBible\u2019s outstanding PSU awards remain subject \nto the Company\u2019s actual performance and will  \nbe paid on the original schedule for such     \nawards after the applicable performance       \nperiods have elapsed. Mr. Bible\u2019s outstanding \nRSU awards remain subject to the current time-\nbased vesting schedule and will be paid on the\noriginal schedule for such awards under the   \nterms of the applicable award agreements. On  \nDecember 2, 2022, Mr. Bible informed Truist   \nthat he will voluntarily resign as a          \nconsultant prior to the end of the Consulting \nPeriod, effective as of May 31, 2023. As a    \nresult of his resignation prior to the end of \nthe Consulting Period, Mr. Bible will forego  \nthe lump sum cash payment of $2,750,000. In   \naddition, Mr. Bible\u2019s consulting fees and     \ncontinued health and welfare benefits will    \nboth cease effective as of May 31, 2023. The  \nremaining terms of the Bible Retirement       \nAgreement described above remain in full force\nand effect. The actual amounts that Mr. Bible \nwill receive under the Bible Retirement       \nAgreement as a result of his resignation are  \nshown in the table above. The amounts that Mr.\nBible would have been entitled to receive     \nunder the Bible Retirement Agreement absent   \nhis resignation are set forth in Footnote 6 to\nthe table above.                              \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    83  \n                                 \nPay Ratio Disclosure SEC rules require us to  \ndisclose the ratio of the annual total        \ncompensation of our CEO to the median         \nemployee\u2019s (teammate\u2019s) annual total          \ncompensation. For 2022, Mr. Roger\u2019s annual    \ntotal compensation was $13,300,120 and the    \nmedian teammate\u2019s annual total compensation   \nwas $86,728. These amounts include the value  \nof certain non-discriminatorybenefits. Based  \nupon this information, the ratio of the annual\ntotal compensation of our CEO to the median   \nteammate was 153 to 1, which is the same as   \nthe ratio that we reported for 2021. The CEO  \npay ratio rules allow us to use the same      \nmedian teammate for comparison purposes for up\nto three years. Although we identified a      \nmedian teammate in 2020, we have decided to   \nselect a new median teammate for 2022,        \nincluding due to the implementation of our $22\nan hour minimum wage, effective October 1,    \n2022, which resulted in over $150 million in  \npay adjustments on an annual basis. For       \npurposes of identifying our median teammate   \nfor 2022, we examined our teammate population,\nexcluding our CEO, as of December 31, 2022. As\npermitted by SEC rules, we excluded (i) 76    \nteammates working in Canada given the small   \nnumber of teammates in that jurisdiction, (ii)\n1,237 teammates hired via various acquisitions\nof other businesses during the year, and (iii)\n453 teammates that were on unpaid leave of    \nabsence for all of 2022. The median teammate  \nwas determined by reviewing wages, tips and   \nother compensation on payroll records for our \nteammate population, as reported to the IRS on\nForm W-2. The pay ratio identified above is a \nreasonable estimate calculated in a manner    \nconsistent with SEC rules. Pay ratios that are\nreported by our peers may not be directly     \ncomparable to ours because of differences in  \nthe composition of each company\u2019s workforce,  \nas well as the assumptions and methodologies  \nused in calculating the pay ratio as permitted\nby SEC rules.                                 \n                                 \n  84    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \n            PayVersus Performance             \nAs required by SEC rules, we are providing the\nfollowing information about the relationship  \nbetween executive compensation actually paid  \nand certain financial performance of the      \nCompany.

While the Company  \nutilizes several performance measures to align\nexecutive compensation with Company           \nperformance, all of those Company measures are\nnot presented in the PvP table set forth      \nabove. Moreover, the Company generally seeks  \nto incentivize long-term performance, and     \ntherefore does not specifically align the     \nCompany\u2019s performance measures with           \ncompensation that is actually paid (as        \ncomputed in accordance with Item 402(v) of    \nRegulation S-K)for a particular year. In      \naccordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation     \nS-K,the Company is providing the following    \ndescriptions of the relationships between     \ninformation presented in the PvP table.       \nCompensation Actually Paid and Cumulative TSR \nThe amount of compensation actually paid to   \nthe PEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as         \napplicable), and the average amount of        \ncompensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s   \nNEOs as a group (excluding Messrs. King and   \nRogers, as applicable) is generally aligned   \nwith the Company\u2019s cumulative TSR over the    \nthree years presented in the table. The       \nalignment of compensation actually paid with  \nthe Company\u2019s cumulative TSR over the period  \npresented is because a significant portion of \nthe compensation actually paid to the NEOs is \ncomprised of equity awards. As described in   \nmore detail in the CD&A, as of December 31,   \n2022, approximately 50% of the value of total \ntarget compensation awarded to the CEO and 43%\nof the value of total target compensation     \nawarded to the other NEOs consists of equity  \nawards, including RSU and PSU awards.         \nCompensation Actually Paid and Net Income The \namount of compensation actually paid to the   \nPEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as applicable),\nand the average amount of compensation        \nactually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs as a group\n(excluding Messrs. King and Rogers, as        \napplicable) is generally alignedwith the      \nCompany\u2019s net income over the three years     \npresented in the PvP table. While the Company \ndoes not use net income as a performance      \nmeasure in the overall executive compensation \nprogram, the measure of net income is         \ncorrelated with the performance measures which\nthe Company uses when setting goals in the    \nCompany\u2019s short-term and long-term incentive  \ncompensation plans, such as EPS, ROAA, ROACE  \nand ROATCE. Each of these measures is         \ncalculated using net income as a component. As\ndescribed in more detail in the CD&A, as of   \nDecember 31, 2022, approximately 69% of the   \nvalue of total target compensation awarded to \nthe CEO and 66% of the value of total target  \ncompensation awarded to the other NEOs is     \nperformance-based pay largely dependent on    \nfinancial measures that are calculated using  \nnet income as a key element. Compensation     \nActually Paid and EPS The amount of           \ncompensation actually paid to the PEOs,       \nMessrs. King and Rogers (as applicable), and  \nthe average amount of compensation actually   \npaid to the Company\u2019s NEOs as a group         \n(excluding Messrs. King and Rogers, as        \napplicable) is generally aligned with the     \nCompany\u2019s EPS over the three years presented  \nin the PvP table. As described above, for     \npurposes of our incentive compensation plans, \nEPS is defined as the Company\u2019s net income    \navailable to common shareholders for the      \napplicable year, adjusted for certain         \nincremental or non-coreperformance items as   \ndetermined by the Compensation and Human      \nCapital Committee, divided by the average     \nnumber of fully diluted common shares         \noutstanding during the year.EPS for purposes  \nof our incentive compensation plans is a non- \nGAAPfinancial measure. See Annex Afor a       \nreconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to  \nEPS as used in our incentive compensation     \nplans for 2022. While the Company uses        \nnumerous financial and non-                   \nfinancialperformance measures for the purpose \nof evaluating performance for the Company\u2019s   \ncompensation programs, the Company has        \ndetermined that EPS is the financial          \nperformance measure that, in the Company\u2019s    \nassessment, represents the most important     \nperformance measure (that is not otherwise    \nrequired to be disclosed in the PvP table)    \nused by the Company to link compensation      \nactually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs, for the  \nmost recently completed fiscal year, to       \nCompany performance. The Company utilizes EPS \nwhen setting goals in the Company\u2019s AIP awards\nprogram with EPS weighted at 50% in           \ndetermining the payouts to the NEOs. As       \ndescribed in more detail in the CD&A, as of   \nDecember 31, 2022, approximately 25% of the   \nvalue of total target compensation awarded to \nthe CEO and 28% of the value of total target  \ncompensation awarded to the other NEOs        \nconsists of amounts determined under the      \nCompany\u2019s AIP awards. Cumulative TSR of the   \nCompany and Cumulative TSR of the Peer Group  \nThe Company\u2019s cumulative TSR over the three-  \nyear period presented in the PvP table was    \n-14.3%,while the cumulative TSR of the peer   \ngroup presented for this purpose, the KBW     \nNasdaq Bank Index, was -2.5%over the three    \nyears presented in the PvP table. The         \nCompany\u2019s cumulative TSR underperformed the   \npeer group over this period primarily due to  \nelevated merger-related costs and slower      \ngrowth and lower asset sensitivity relative to\nthe peer group.

We are providing shareholders\nthe option of selecting a frequency of one,   \ntwo or three years, or abstaining. For the    \nreasons described below, we recommend that our\nshareholders select a frequency of one year,  \nor an annual vote held every year. The        \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee and  \nour Board of Directors recognize the          \nimportance of receiving regular input from our\nshareholders on important issues such as      \nexecutive compensation. As such, we believe   \nthat conducting an advisory vote on our       \nexecutive compensation on an annual basis is  \nthe most appropriate choice for our           \nshareholders because it (i) is consistent with\nour practice of engaging with our             \nshareholders, and obtaining their input, on   \nour corporate governance matters and our      \nexecutive compensation philosophy, policies,  \nand practices; (ii) better corresponds with   \nthe presentation of compensation information  \nin this proxy statement; and (iii) will allow \nour shareholders to provide us with their     \ndirect input on our compensation philosophy,  \npolicies and practices as disclosed in this   \nproxy statement on a timely basis. Therefore, \nwe ask that our shareholders select every \u201c   \nOne Year\u201d when voting on the frequency of     \nadvisory votes on executive compensation. We  \nhave included this Proposal 4 in our proxy    \nstatement pursuant to the requirements of the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer    \nProtection Act and Section 14A of the Exchange\nAct. The option of one year, two years or     \nthree years that receives the highest number  \nof votes cast by shareholders will be the     \nfrequency for the advisory vote on approval of\nour executive compensation program that has   \nbeen selected by our shareholders. Such       \ndetermination is advisory, however, and not   \nbinding on the Company. Although the say-on-  \nfrequencyvote is non-binding,the Compensation \nand Human Capital Committee and our Board of  \nDirectors value your opinion and will consider\nthe outcome of the say-on-frequencyvote in    \nestablishing the frequency with which the     \nadvisory say-on-payvote to approve our        \nexecutive compensation program will be held in\nthe future.                                   \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    89  \n                                 \nProposal 5\u2014Shareholder Proposal Relating to an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board of Directors\nThe following proposal was submitted by       \nKenneth Steiner of 14 Stoner Ave., 2M, Great  \nNeck, NY 11021. Mr. Steiner owns at least 500 \nshares of our common stock. The Company is not\nresponsible for the accuracy or content of the\nproposal and supporting statement presented   \nbelow which, following SEC rules, are         \nreproduced as received from the proponent.    \nProposal 5\u2014Independent Board Chairman         \nShareholders request that the Board of        \nDirectors adopt an enduring policy, and amend \nthe governing documents as necessary in order \nthat 2 separate people hold the office of the \nChairman and the office of the CEO. Whenever  \npossible, the Chairman of the Board shall be  \nan Independent Director. The Board has the    \ndiscretion to select a Temporary Chairman of  \nthe Board who is not an Independent Director  \nto serve while the Board is seeking an        \nIndependent Chairman of the Board. Although it\nis best practice to adopt this proposal soon  \nthis policy could be phased in when there is a\ncontract renewal for our current CEO or for   \nthe next CEO transition. This proposal topic  \nwon 52% support at Boeing and 54% support at  \nBaxter International in 2020. Boeing then     \nadopted this proposal topic. This proposal    \ntopic also received 44%-support at the 2020   \nTruist Financial annual meeting. This         \n44%-support may have represented a majority   \nvote from the shareholders who had access to  \nindependent proxy voting advice. It is        \nespecially important to have an independent   \nboard Chairman with our unwieldy board with 21\ndirectors. Perhaps there should be a rule     \nagainst a person who has been a CEO and a     \nChairman at the same time being named as Lead \nDirector. Mr. Thomas Skains had 13-yearsin the\ndual jobs of CEO and Chairman. Past and       \npresent holders of both jobs at the same time \nwould seem to have a special affinity which is\ninconsistent with the oversight role of a Lead\nDirector. Mr. Skains also received the second \nhighest number of against votes for a Truist  \nFinancial director in 2022 (second highest    \nagainst votes in a field of 21 directors). It \nis time for a change given that our stock was \nat $62 in December 2021. With the current CEO \nserving as Chair this means giving up a       \nsubstantial check and balance safeguard that  \ncan only occur with an independent Board      \nChairman. A lead director is no substitute for\nan independent board chairman. A lead director\ncannot call a special shareholder meeting and \ncannot even call a special meeting of the     \nboard. A lead director can delegate most of   \nhis lead director duties to others and then   \nsimply rubber-stamp it. There is no way       \nshareholders can be sure of what goes on.     \nPlease vote yes: Independent Board            \nChairman\u2014Proposal 5                           \n                                 \n  90    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 5\u2014Shareholder Proposal Relating to an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board of Directors\nSTATEMENT OF THE TRUIST BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN \nOPPOSITION TO THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL The    \nTruist Board of Directors believes that the   \nproponent\u2019s proposal is not in the best       \ninterests of the Company and its shareholders \nand recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 5 The\nBoard of Directors has carefully considered   \nthe shareholder proposal and believes that the\nCompany and its shareholders are best served  \nif the Board has the flexibility to decide how\nto allocate the responsibilities of the       \noffices of the Chairman and of the CEO, taking\ninto consideration the unique circumstances of\nthe Company. WE HAVE A ROBUST LEADERSHIP      \nSTRUCTURE AND AN EMPOWERED INDEPENDENT BOARD  \nTHAT PROVIDES EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT We believe  \nthat the Company\u2019s robust corporate governance\nstructure enables the Board to strike the     \nright balance between decisive leadership and \nrigorous independent oversight of management. \nA similar proposal was put to a vote of our   \nshareholders at our 2020 and 2022 Annual      \nMeetings. While the proposal did not receive  \nsupport from a majority of shareholders at    \nthose meetings, we proactively reached out to \nengage with our shareholders to understand,   \nand be responsive to, their views on this     \ntopic. As a result of this extensive outreach \nand engagement, we updated our Corporate      \nGovernance Guidelines to ensure that the      \nauthority and responsibilities of our         \nindependent Lead Director are robust,         \nconsistent with best practices, to provide an \neffective counterbalance to the Board         \nChairman. In response to shareholder feedback,\nthe Board also removed bylaw provisions       \nstipulating that Mr. Rogers serve as the      \ncombined Chairman and CEO. Shareholders had   \nexpressed concern that those provisions may   \nunduly restrict the Board\u2019s flexibility in    \nchoosing the best director to serve as        \nChairman. Following the outreach and these    \nchanges made in response to the shareholder   \nengagement, support for this proposal at our  \n2022 Annual Meeting declined by approximately \n11% compared to our 2020 Annual Meeting. We   \nregularlyreview and seek to improve our       \nCorporate Governance Guidelines based on a    \nreview of prevailing practices among S&P 500  \nfirms. In recent years, we made important     \nchanges to our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nto further strengthen the role of the         \nindependent Lead Director, including the      \nauthority to:                                 \n                                              \n     Convene, set the agenda for and preside  \n  \u2022  over executive sessions of the           \n     non-management directors at each         \n     regularly scheduled Board meeting.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Preside at all meetings of the Board at  \n  \u2022  which the Chairman is not present,       \n     including executive sessions.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Take responsibility for feedback to and  \n  \u2022  engagement with the Chairman and CEO on  \n     executive sessions.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Suggest matters and issues for           \n  \u2022  inclusion on the Board agendas and       \n     approve such agendas.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Have the authority to call and preside   \n  \u2022  over meetings of the independent         \n     directors.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Approve information that is sent to the  \n  \u2022  Board in preparation for and at Board    \n     meetings.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Approve all Board and Committee          \n  \u2022  schedules to ensure that there is        \n     sufficient time for discussion of all    \n     agenda items.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Serve as liaison between and facilitate  \n  \u2022  teamwork and communication among         \n     independent directors and the Chairman   \n     and CEO.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     If requested by major shareholders,      \n  \u2022  ensure that he or she is reasonably      \n     available for consultation and direct    \n     communication.                           \n                                              \nIn 2022, our Board of Directors approved      \nfurther changes to our Corporate Governance   \nGuidelines, providing the role of our         \nindependent Lead Director with the following  \nadditional responsibilities in the event that \nthe positions of Chairman and CEO are combined\nand that individual also serves as the Chair  \nof the Executive Committee:                   \n                                              \n  \u2022  Serve as a member of the Executive       \n     Committee                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Approve the scheduling of Executive      \n  \u2022  Committee meetings, suggest matters for  \n     inclusion on the Executive Committee     \n     agendas, and approve such agendas        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Approve information sent to Executive    \n  \u2022  Committee members in preparation for     \n     and at Executive Committee meetings      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Preside at all meetings of the           \n  \u2022  Executive Committee at which the Chair   \n     is not present (including executive      \n     sessions)                                \n                                              \nWith these responsibilities, the Board is     \nconfident that our current leadership         \nstructure enables Truist to operate in the    \nlong-term interests of shareholders and       \nmaintain a strong, independent perspective,   \nproviding the necessary checks and balances   \nand enabling a thoughtful and dynamic board   \nthat constructively evaluates, but is not     \ndominated by, the views of senior management. \nIn March 2022, Thomas E. Skains was named as  \nour independent Lead Director. Mr. Skains, as \nthe former Chairman, President and CEO of     \nPiedmont Natural Gas Company and a current    \ndirector at each of Duke Energy Corporation   \nand National Fuel Gas Company,                \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    91  \n                                 \nProposal 5\u2014Shareholder Proposal Relating to an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board of Directors\nhas extensive experience in leadership and    \ndirector roles at other large publicly traded \ncompanies, providing him valuable perspective \nin service to the Truist Board. Having this   \nstrong Lead Director tasked with the          \nresponsibilities outlined above allows        \neffective management and communication among  \nall of our directors. The selection of our    \nLead Director is governed by our Corporate    \nGovernance Guidelines. Mr. Skains will serve  \nin this capacity for an initial two-yearterm  \nand may serve for subsequent one-yearterm(s)  \nat the discretion of the Board. Under our     \nCorporate Governance Guidelines, our Lead     \nDirector is appointed by the majority vote of \nthe independent directors of the Board, which \nfurther strengthens our commitment to long-   \nterm and effective governance. Our Corporate  \nGovernance Guidelines also require that a     \nmajority of our Board of Directors, and each  \nmember of certain key board committees, the   \nAudit Committee, the Compensation and Human   \nCapital Committee and the Nominating and      \nGovernance Committee, be \u201cindependent\u201d under  \napplicable NYSE and SEC rules. This ensures   \nthat oversight of critical matters\u2014such as the\nintegrity of Truist\u2019s financial statements,   \nthe compensation of our executive officers,   \nthe selection and evaluation of directors, and\nthe development of corporate governance       \nprinciples\u2014is entrusted to independent        \ndirectors. Presently, 90.5% of our directors  \nare independent, and only independent         \ndirectors are serving on the Audit Committee, \nthe Compensation and Human Capital Committee  \nand the Nominating and Governance Committee.  \nTHE BOARD BELIEVES FLEXIBILITY IN BOARD       \nLEADERSHIP STRUCTURE IS MORE SUITABLE FOR US  \nTHAN A RIGID AND PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH. The   \nBoard considers that the short- and long-term \ninterests of the Company\u2019s shareholders are   \ncurrently best served by Mr. Rogers performing\nas both Board Chairman and CEO. The Company\u2019s \nperformance under a combined CEO and Chairman \nrole has been effective in advancing its      \npurpose and delivering results, including     \ncompletion of the merger integration last     \nyear. This momentum was also seen in 2022 as  \nTruist achieved positive operating leverage   \nfor the full year. The Board believes that    \nunder the current circumstances, having a     \nChairman who leads the daily operations of the\nbusiness is important from a strategic vision \nand direction standpoint and has allowed the  \nBoard to act quickly and be responsive to     \nchallenges and opportunities as they arise.   \nThe Board also believes that a combined       \nChairman and CEO provides clearer             \ncommunication for directors, teammates and    \nstakeholders and that having a single         \nspokesperson avoids confusion in an uncertain \neconomic and regulatory environment. An       \nalternative arrangement could limit the       \nBoard\u2019s effectiveness at this time. Moreover, \nour Corporate Governance Guidelines embody the\nflexibility that is key to our leadership     \nstructure by providing the Board with the     \nability to determine if the CEO should also   \nserve as Chairman when electing a new         \nChairman. As referenced above, our bylaws no  \nlonger provide for Mr. Rogers to serve as the \nChairman while acting as CEO. In addition, Mr.\nRogers\u2019 employment agreement has now expired  \nin its entirety, and he is serving without an \nemployment agreement with Truist. As a result,\nthere are no merger-related or other          \nagreements still in existence that could      \nrestrict the Board\u2019s selection of the best    \ncandidate to serve as Chairman. The Board     \nbelieves that Truist and its shareholders will\ncontinue to benefit from this flexibility, as \nour directors are well-positioned to determine\nour leadership structure given their in-      \ndepthknowledge of our leadership team, our    \nstrategic goals, and the opportunities and    \nchallenges we face. SHAREHOLDERS OF LARGE     \nPUBLIC COMPANIES HAVE VOTED AGAINST RECENT    \nINDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIR PROPOSALS Shareholders\nof Russell 3000 companies have repeatedly     \nvoted against independent board chair         \nproposals. To this point, for Russell 3000    \ncompanies with meetings between July 1, 2021  \nand June 30, 2022, 42 companies received      \nindependent board chair shareholder proposals \nthat were presented for a shareholder vote and\nonly one was approved by shareholders.        \nAdditionally, six bank holding companies with \nmeetings between July 1, 2020 and June 30,    \n2022 in the Russell 3000 received independent \nboard chair shareholder proposals that were   \npresented for a shareholder vote, and none of \nthe proposals were approved by                \nshareholders.These statistics demonstrate that\nshareholders of other large public companies  \nhave determined that the implementation of    \nthis type of proposal is not necessary and not\nin the best interests of shareholders. * * *  \nFor the reasons discussed above, our Board of \nDirectors believes that the proposal is not in\nthe best interests of the Company or its      \nshareholders.                                 \n                                 \n  92    |\u00a0\u00a02023 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nStock Ownership Information The table below   \nsets forth the beneficial ownership of Truist \ncommon stock as of January 31, 2023 by (i) all\ndirectors, (ii) the named executive officers  \n(or NEOs) in this proxy statement, (iii) all  \nthen-current directors and executive officers \nof Truist as a group, and (iv) each person who\nis known by Truist to be the beneficial owner \nof more than five percent of our common stock.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all persons listed\nbelow have sole voting and investment powers  \nover all shares beneficially owned.           \n                                              \n                  S\u2026                          \n                  of                          \n      \u2026           C\u2026                          \n      \u2026           S\u2026                P\u2026        \n      \u2026           S\u2026       T\u2026       of        \n      \u2026           to                C\u2026        \n      \u2026           a                 S\u2026        \n      \u2026           R\u2026                          \n                  to                          \n                  A\u2026                          \n                                              \n         2\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         1\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         6\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         4\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         2\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         7\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         1\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         2\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         5\u2026  \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         4\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         3\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         7\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         8\u2026  \u2026        \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         3\u2026  \u2026        \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         1\u2026  \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         1\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         2\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         3\u2026  \u2026        \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         7\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         5\u2026  \u2026        \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         6\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        *     \n         1\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         3\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         5\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         1\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         2\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        *     \n         3\u2026           \u2026        \u2026        *     \n                                              \n         9\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        \u2026  %  \n         1\u2026           \u2014        \u2026        \u2026  %  \n                                              \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    93  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Stock Ownership Information*Less than       \n  1%.(1)As reported to Truist by the          \n  directors and executive officers, and       \n  includes shares held by spouses, minor      \n  children, Individual Retirement Accounts    \n  (IRAs), affiliated companies,               \n  partnerships, limited liability companies   \n  and trusts as to which each such person     \n  has beneficial ownership.

Awards and fees deferred \nunder these plans are treated as if they were \ninvested in shares of Truist common stock with\npayouts being made in shares or cash after the\ndirector\u2019s retirement or other separation from\nthe Board depending on the terms of the plan  \npursuant to which the awards or fees were     \ndeferred.

As a result, if you do not provide \nspecific voting instructions to your record   \nholder, New York Stock Exchange rules will    \nallow the record holder to vote only on       \nProposal 2, and not on Proposals 1 or         \n3-5.Broker non-votes,as well as abstentions,  \nwill be counted in the number of shares       \nrepresented for purposes of determining       \nwhether a quorum is present, but they will not\nbe counted as votes cast for or against any of\nthe proposals, and therefore will not affect  \nthe outcome of the vote. Holders of our common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights in \nthe election of directors. A proxy may be     \nrevoked by a shareholder at any time before it\nis exercised by submitting to the Corporate   \nSecretary of Truist an instrument revoking it,\nsubmitting a duly executed proxy bearing a    \nlater date (including a proxy given over the  \ninternet or by telephone), or by (i) attending\n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    97  \n                                 \nVoting and Other Information the virtual      \nAnnual Meeting and electing to vote using the \nvirtual platform or (ii) attending the Annual \nMeeting in person and electing to vote by in- \npersonballot. Even if you plan to attend the  \nAnnual Meeting, whether virtually or in       \nperson, you are encouraged to vote your shares\nby proxy. Delivering Proxy Materials We       \ndeliver proxy materials primarily through the \ninternet in accordance with SEC rules. In     \naddition to reducing the amount of paper used \nin producing these materials, this method     \nlowers the costs associated with mailing the  \nproxy materials to shareholders. Shareholders \nwho own Truist common shares directly and not \nthrough a bank, broker or nominee (\u201crecord    \nholders\u201d) will have proxy materials or the    \nNotice of Internet Availability delivered     \ndirectly to their mailing address or          \nelectronically if they have previously        \nconsented to delivery by email. Shareholders  \nwhose shares are held for them by banks,      \nbrokers or other nominees (\u201cbeneficial        \nholders\u201d) will have the proxy materials or the\nNotice of Internet Availability forwarded to  \nthem by the intermediary that holds the       \nshares. If you received only a Notice of      \nInternet Availability by mail, you will not   \nreceive a printed copy of the proxy materials \nunless you request a copy by following the    \ninstructions on the notice. The Notice of     \nInternet Availability also contains           \ninstructions for accessing and reviewing the  \nproxy materials over the internet and provides\ndirections for submitting your vote over the  \ninternet. In accordance with SEC rules, we    \nsent proxy materials or a Notice of Internet  \nAvailability on or about March 13, 2023 to our\nshareholders of record as of the close of     \nbusiness on February 16, 2023. To reduce the  \nexpenses of delivering duplicate proxy        \nmaterials to shareholders, we rely on SEC     \nrules that permit us to deliver only one set  \nof applicable proxy materials to multiple     \nshareholders who share an address, unless we  \nreceive contrary instructions from any        \nshareholder at that address. All shareholders \nsharing an address will continue to receive   \nseparate proxy cards based on their registered\nownership of Truist common stock. Any         \nshareholder sharing an address who does not   \nreceive an individual proxy statement, our    \n2022 Annual Report and our Annual Report on   \nForm 10-Kmay write or call Broadridge Investor\nCommunication Solutions, Inc., as specified   \nbelow, and we will promptly deliver the       \nmaterials at no cost. For future meetings, a  \nregistered shareholder may request separate   \ncopies of our proxy materials or request that \nwe only send one set of these materials if the\nshareholder is receiving multiple copies by   \ntelephoning our transfer agent at             \n1-800-213-4314,or writing the transfer agent  \nat: Computershare Trust Company N.A., P.O.

Director           \nnominations for inclusion in our proxy        \nstatement (Proxy Access) .As set forth in our \nbylaws, a shareholder or group of up to 20    \nshareholders that has held at least 3% of     \nTruist\u2019s stock for at least three years is    \nable to submit director nominees for up to 25%\nof the Board (or at least two directors) for  \ninclusion in our proxy statement if the       \nshareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the     \nrequirements specified in our bylaws and      \nnotice is received at least 120 days, but not \nearlier than 150 days, before the anniversary \nof the date the proxy statement for the prior \nyear\u2019s annual meeting was released to         \nshareholders. In order for a nominee to be    \nconsidered for inclusion in our proxy         \nstatement for the 2024 annual meeting of      \nshareholders, a shareholder must deliver      \ntimely notice in writing to the Corporate     \nSecretary (at the address above) no earlier   \nthan October 15, 2023, and no later than      \nNovember 14, 2023. The notice must contain the\nspecific information required by Article II,  \nSection 14 of our bylaws. Other shareholder   \nproposals and director nominations (Advance   \nNotice Provisions) .Our bylaws also allow     \nshareholders to submit nominations for        \ndirector or other business proposals to be    \nconsidered at a meeting of shareholders where \nsuch proposals or nominees will not be        \nincluded in our proxy materials (including any\nshareholder proposal not submitted under Rule \n14a-8or any director nomination not made      \npursuant to the proxy access bylaw). These    \nadvance notice provisions are separate from   \nthe requirements that a shareholder must meet \nin order to have a proposal included in the   \nproxy statement under SEC rules or the        \nrequirements that a shareholder must meet in  \norder to have a director nomination included  \nin the proxy statement under our proxy access \nbylaw.

In        \naddition to satisfying the foregoing          \nrequirements under our bylaws, to comply with \nthe universal proxy rules, shareholders who   \nintend to solicit proxies in support of       \ndirector nominees other than Truist\u2019s nominees\nmust provide notice that sets forth the       \ninformation required by SEC Rule 14a-19no     \nlater than February 26, 2024.

You should not\nplace undue reliance on any forward-looking   \nstatement and should consider the             \nuncertainties and risks discussed in our most \nrecent Annual Report on Form 10-Kand          \nsubsequent Securities and Exchange Commission \nfilings.

The \nforward-looking statements in this proxy      \nstatement are made as of the date of this     \nproxy statement, unless otherwise indicated,  \nand Truist undertakes no obligation to revise \nor update any forward-looking statements,     \nexcept to the extent required by applicable   \nlaw or regulation.                            \n                                 \n  2023 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    99  \n                                 \nAnnex A\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures As        \npreviously described, for the purposes of     \nmeasuring Truist\u2019s performance under Truist\u2019s \ncompensation plans, the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee typically makes adjustments \nto Truist\u2019s GAAP results to ensure that the   \nparticipants are compensated for Truist\u2019s core\nperformance. For 2022, the Compensation and   \nHuman Capital Committee made adjustments to   \nTruist\u2019s GAAP net income, as set forth in the \ntables below (\u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d).         \nTypically, the Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee adjusts Truist\u2019s GAAP net income for\ngains or losses on sales of businesses,       \nmerger-related and restructuring charges and  \nsimilar non-coreperformance items, on a pre-  \ntaxbasis, provided the adjustment is not      \nsolely a tax-relateditem. Results for 2022    \nalso included adjustments for unusual economic\nactivity, including favorable interest rate   \nincreases in comparison to planned levels.    \nThese adjustments are made so that            \nparticipants are compensated for Truist\u2019s core\nperformance in comparison to planned levels   \nand are neither penalized nor rewarded for    \nnon-corecharges, unusual gains, or similar    \nnon-coreevents. Executive Leadership also uses\nthese financial measures in evaluating        \nTruist\u2019s financial performance. To the extent \npracticable, the Compensation and Human       \nCapital Committee also makes similar          \nadjustments to the reported performance of    \npeer group members for awards that measure    \nTruist\u2019s performance relative to the peer     \ngroup. The adjustments for 2022 affect the    \nAnnual Incentive Performance awards\u2019          \nperformance metrics, EPS and ROAA, and the    \nthree-year average ROACE and ROATCE for LTIP  \nand PSU purposes. Truist derives the adjusted \nversion of each of these performance metrics  \nfrom its Adjusted Net Income, which is a non- \nGAAPfinancial measure, and accordingly, each  \nof these adjusted financial measures is       \ndetermined by methods other than in accordance\nwith GAAP and are thus non-GAAPmetrics.
