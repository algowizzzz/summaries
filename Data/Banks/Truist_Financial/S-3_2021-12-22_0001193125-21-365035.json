Truist\u0092s insurance\nsubsidiaries are regulated,\nsupervised and examined by various state\ninsurance authorities.\n\nChanges to federal laws and regulations as\nwell as to the laws and\nregulations in the states where we and our\nsubsidiaries do business can affect the\noperating environment of our financial holding\ncompany and its subsidiaries in substantial\nand unpredictable ways. We cannot accurately\npredict whether legislation\nwill ultimately be enacted, and, if enacted,\nthe ultimate effect that it, or implementing\nregulations, would have upon our or our\nsubsidiaries\u0092 financial condition or results\nof operations.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThe debt securities will constitute either\nsenior debt securities or subordinated debt\nsecurities. The senior debt securities will be\nissued\nunder a senior indenture with U.S. Bank\nNational Association, a national banking\nassociation (successor to the corporate trust\nbusiness of State Street Bank and Trust\nCompany), as senior trustee. The subordinated\ndebt securities will be issued under\na subordinated indenture with U.S. Bank\nNational Association, as subordinated trustee.\nWe collectively refer to the senior indenture\nand the subordinated indenture as the\n\u0093indentures\u0094 and the senior trustee and the\nsubordinated trustee as\nthe \u0093trustee.\u0094 In the event of the resignation\nor removal of the trustee prior to the\nissuance of a particular series of debt\nsecurities, the trustee for such series of\ndebt securities will be identified in the\nprospectus supplement for\nsuch series, and all references to \u0093trustee\u0094\nshall be deemed to mean the trustee so\nidentified. No trustee shall be responsible\nfor the acts, obligations, liabilities or\nresponsibilities of any other trustee.\n\nThe following summaries of certain provisions\nof the indentures may not be complete and are\nsubject to, and are qualified in their\nentirety by\nreference to, all the provisions of the\nindentures and any prospectus supplement or\npricing supplement to which they may relate.\nWherever particular sections or defined terms\nof the indentures are referred to, we intend\nthat such sections or\ndefinitions shall be incorporated herein by\nreference. Capitalized terms not otherwise\ndefined in this prospectus or in the\napplicable prospectus supplement and, if\nnecessary, the applicable pricing supplement,\nhave the meanings given such terms in\nthe indentures. When we offer any debt\nsecurities\u0097which we refer to as \u0093Offered\nSecurities\u0094\u0097we will describe in that\nprospectus supplement or pricing supplement\nthe particular terms of the Offered Securities\nand the extent, if\nany, to which such general provisions may\napply to the Offered Securities.\n\nDebt Securities Generally\n\nThe indentures do not limit the aggregate\nprincipal amount of debt securities that may\nbe issued under them and provide that debt\nsecurities\nmay be issued from time to time in one or more\nseries. The debt securities will be\n\n-7-\n\nour direct, unsecured obligations, and will\nnot be savings accounts, deposits or other\nobligations of any of our bank or non-\nbanksubsidiaries, and will not be insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernmental agency. Neither the indentures\nnor the debt securities will limit or\notherwise restrict the amount of other\nindebtedness that we may incur or other\nsecurities that we or any of our subsidiaries\nmay issue.

In addition, the holders of a\nmajority in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding debt securities of any series may\nrescind a declaration of acceleration of the\ndebt securities of any series if:\n                                              \n      we pay the trustee certain amounts due  \n      the trustee plus all matured            \n      installments of principal of, and any   \n      premium                                 \n      and interest on, the debt securities    \n      of such series, other than              \n      installments due by acceleration, and   \n      interest on the overdue installments    \n      to the extent provided in the           \n      applicable indenture, and               \n                                              \n                                              \n      all other defaults with respect to the  \n      debt securities of that series under    \n      the applicable indenture have been      \n      cured or waived (Section 4.01 of the    \n      senior indenture; Section\u00a05.01 of the   \n      subordinated indenture).                \n                                              \n-10-\n\nConsolidation, Merger, Sale, Conveyance and\nLease Each indenture provides that we may not\nconsolidate with or merge into another\ncorporation, or convey, transfer or lease\nsubstantially all of our properties and assets\nto any person unless:\n                                              \n      the successor assumes our obligations   \n      on the debt securities and under the    \n      applicable indenture;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      after giving effect to the              \n      transaction, no event of default, and   \n      no event which, after notice or lapse   \n      of time or                              \n      both, would become an event of          \n      default, has occurred and is            \n      continuing under the applicable         \n      indenture; and                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      certain other conditions are met        \n      (Section 9.01 of the senior indenture;  \n      Section\u00a010.01 of the subordinated       \n      indenture).                             \n                                              \nIn that event, the successor will be\nsubstituted for us and, except in the case of\na lease, we will be relieved of our\nobligations under the applicable indenture and\nthe debt securities of each outstanding series\n(Section 9.02 of the senior indenture; Section\n10.02 of the subordinated indenture). The\nTrustee We will have no material relationship\nwith the trustee other than as trustee. Any\nPrincipal Constituent Bank may transact\nbusiness with the trustee in the ordinary\ncourse. Under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,\nthe indentures are deemed to contain certain\nlimitations on the right of the trustee, as\nour creditor, to obtain payment of claims in\ncertain cases or to realize on certain\nproperty received in respect of any such\nclaim, as security or otherwise. The trustee\nwill be permitted to engage in transactions\nwith us, provided that those transactions do\nnot result in a material relationship between\nthe trustee and us. The occurrence of a\ndefault under either indenture with respect to\nsubordinated debt securities or senior debt\nsecurities could create a conflicting interest\nfor the trustee under the Trust Indenture Act.\nIf the default has not been cured or waived\nwithin 90 days after the trustee has or\nacquires a conflicting interest, the trustee\ngenerally is required by the Trust Indenture\nAct to eliminate such conflicting interest or\nresign as trustee with respect to the senior\ndebt securities or the subordinated debt\nsecurities. In the event of the trustee\u0092s\nresignation, we will promptly appoint a\nsuccessor trustee with respect to the affected\nsecurities. Senior Debt Securities The senior\ndebt securities will be our direct, unsecured\nobligations and will rank equally and ratably\nwith all of our outstanding unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness. Restriction on\nSale or Issuance of Voting Stock of Principal\nConstituent Banks Except as described above\nunder \u0093Consolidation, Merger, Sale, Conveyance\nand Lease,\u0094 the senior indenture prohibits (i)\nour sale or other disposition of shares of, or\nsecurities convertible into, or options,\nwarrants or rights to subscribe for, or\npurchase shares of voting stock of, a\nPrincipal Constituent Bank, or (ii) a\nPrincipal Constituent Bank\u0092s issuance of its\nown shares of, or securities convertible into,\nor options, warrants or rights to subscribe\nfor, or purchase its own shares of voting\nstock if, in each of (i) and (ii) above, after\ngiving effect to such transaction the\nPrincipal Constituent Bank would cease to be a\nControlled Subsidiary. In addition, the senior\nindenture prohibits the merger or\nconsolidation of a Principal Constituent Bank\nwith any other corporation unless we are or a\nControlled Subsidiary is the surviving\ncorporation, and the lease, sale or transfer\nof all or substantially all the properties and\nassets of a Principal Constituent Bank to any\ncorporation or person, except to us or a\nControlled Subsidiary or a person that, upon\nsuch lease, sale or transfer, will become our\nsuccessor company or a Controlled Subsidiary.\nThe senior indenture, however, does not\nprohibit any such sale, assignment, transfer\nor disposition of securities, any such merger\nor consolidation or any such lease, sale or\ntransfer of -11-\n\nproperties and assets if required by law or as\na condition imposed by law to the acquisition\nby us or any Controlled Subsidiary, directly\nor indirectly, of any person if, thereafter:\n                                              \n      such person would be a Controlled       \n      Subsidiary;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n      our Consolidated Net Banking Assets     \n      would not be decreased; and             \n                                              \n                                              \n      Truist Bank would still be a            \n      Controlled Subsidiary (Section 3.06 of  \n      the senior indenture).                  \n                                              \n\u0093Consolidated Net Banking Assets\u0094 means all\nnet assets owned directly or indirectly by\neach bank subsidiary as such net assets would\nbe reflected on a consolidated balance sheet\nof Truist prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles at\nthe time. \u0093Controlled Subsidiary\u0094 means any\nsubsidiary of which more than 80% of the\naggregate voting power of the outstanding\nshares of the voting stock is at the time\nowned directly or indirectly by us or by one\nor more of our Controlled Subsidiaries, after\ngiving effect to the issuance to any person\nother than us or any Controlled Subsidiary of\nvoting stock of the subsidiary issuable on\nexercise of options, warrants or rights to\nsubscribe for such voting stock or on\nconversion of securities convertible into such\nvoting stock. \u0093Principal Constituent Bank\u0094\nmeans Truist Bank and, at any time, any other\nbank subsidiary the total assets of which, as\nset forth in the most recent statement of\ncondition of such bank subsidiary, equal more\nthan 30% of the total assets of all bank\nsubsidiaries as determined from the most\nrecent statements of condition of the bank\nsubsidiaries. Limitation on Creation of Liens\nThe senior indenture provides that we will not\ncreate, assume, incur or suffer to exist any\npledge, encumbrance or lien, as security for\nindebtedness for borrowed money, upon any\nshares of, or securities convertible into, or\noptions, warrants or rights to subscribe for\nor purchase shares of, voting stock of a\nPrincipal Constituent Bank, if, treating the\npledge, encumbrance or lien as a transfer to\nthe secured party, the Principal Constituent\nBank would not be a Controlled Subsidiary\n(Section 3.07 of the senior indenture). Events\nof Default The senior indenture defines an\nevent of default with respect to any\nparticular series of senior debt securities as\nbeing any one of the following events unless\nit is either inapplicable to a particular\nseries or specifically deleted or modified for\nthe senior debt securities of such series:\n                                              \n      default for 30 days in the payment of   \n      any interest upon any of the senior     \n      debt securities of that series;

The senior indenture provides\nthat after a default occurs, the senior\ntrustee shall mail to the holders of the\nsenior debt securities of that series notice\nof all uncured defaults known to it that have\nnot been waived within 90 days. The term\n\u0093defaults\u0094 includes events specified above\nthat, after notice or lapse of time or both,\nwould become an event of default. Except in\nthe case of default in the payment of\nprincipal of, or any premium or interest on,\nany of the senior debt securities of that\nseries or in the making of any sinking fund\npayment or analogous obligation with respect\nto the senior debt securities of that series,\nthe senior trustee may withhold such notice if\nit in good faith determines that withholding\nsuch notice is in the interest of the holders\nof the securities of that series (Section\n4.08). Subject to the provisions of the senior\nindenture relating to the duties of the senior\ntrustee in case an event of default shall\noccur and be continuing, the senior trustee is\nunder no obligation to exercise any of the\nrights or powers vested in it under the senior\nindenture at the request, order or direction\nof any of the holders of the senior debt\nsecurities, unless such holders offer to the\nsenior trustee reasonable security or\nindemnity (Section 5.02(d)). Subject to\ncertain limitations contained in the senior\nindenture, including among other limitations\nthat the senior trustee will not be exposed to\npersonal liability, the holders of a majority\nin aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding senior debt securities of all\nseries affected, voting as one class, have the\nright to direct the time, method and place of\nconducting any proceeding for any remedy\navailable to the senior trustee, or exercising\nany trust or power conferred on the senior\ntrustee (Section 4.07). No holder of any\nsenior debt security of any series will have\nany right to institute any proceeding with\nrespect to the senior indenture or for any\nremedy thereunder, unless:\n                                              \n      such holder previously shall have       \n      given to the senior trustee written     \n      notice of a continuing event of         \n      default                                 \n      with respect to senior debt securities  \n      of that series,                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      the holders of not less than 25% in     \n      aggregate principal amount (in the      \n      case of a series of senior debt         \n      securities                              \n      issued at an original issue discount,   \n      calculated in accordance with the       \n      formula set forth in such series) of    \n      the outstanding senior debt securities  \n      of that series shall have made written  \n      request, and offered reasonable         \n      indemnity, to the senior                \n      trustee to institute such proceeding    \n      as trustee, and                         \n                                              \n-13-\n                                              \n      the senior trustee shall not have       \n      received from the holders of a          \n      majority in principal amount of the     \n      outstanding                             \n      senior debt securities of that series   \n      a direction inconsistent with such      \n      request and shall have failed to        \n      institute such proceeding within 60     \n      days (Section 4.04).                    \n                                              \nThe holder of any senior debt security,\nhowever, will have an absolute right to\nreceive payment of the principal of and any\npremium and interest, if any, on such senior\ndebt security on or after the due dates\nexpressed in such senior debt security and to\ninstitute suit for the enforcement of any such\npayment (Section 4.04). We are obligated to\nfurnish annually to the senior trustee a\nstatement as to our performance of our\nobligations under the senior indenture and as\nto any default in such obligations (Section\n3.04). Defeasance We may terminate certain of\nour obligations under the senior indenture\nwith respect to the senior debt securities of\nany series on the terms and subject to the\nconditions contained in the senior indenture,\nby:\n                                              \n      depositing irrevocably with the senior  \n      trustee as trust funds in trust:        \n                                              \n                                              \n      U.S. dollars or U.S. Government         \n      Obligations (as defined below) in an    \n      amount which, through the payment of    \n      interest, principal and premium, if     \n      any, in respect thereof in accordance   \n      with their terms will provide, without  \n      any reinvestment of such interest,      \n      principal and premium, if any, not      \n      later than one business day before the  \n      due date of any payment,                \n      money, or                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      a combination of money and U.S.         \n      Government Obligations sufficient to    \n      pay the principal of, and any premium   \n      and                                     \n      interest on, the senior debt            \n      securities of such series as such are   \n      due; and                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      satisfying certain other conditions     \n      precedent specified in the senior       \n      indenture.                              \n                                              \nSuch deposit and termination are conditioned,\namong other things, upon our delivery of an\nopinion of independent counsel that the\nholders of the senior debt securities of such\nseries will have no federal income tax\nconsequences as a result of such deposit and\ntermination, accompanied by a ruling to that\neffect received from or published by the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Service. Such termination\nwill not relieve us of our obligation to pay\nwhen due the principal of, and premium and\ninterest on, the senior debt securities of\nsuch series if the senior debt securities of\nsuch series are not paid from the money or\nU.S. Government Obligations held by the senior\ntrustee for payment thereof (Section 13.05).\n\u0093U.S. Government Obligations\u0094 means securities\nthat are direct obligations of the United\nStates of America for the payment of which its\nfull faith and credit are pledged or\nobligations of a person controlled or\nsupervised by and acting as an agency or\ninstrumentality of the United States of\nAmerica the payment of which is\nunconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and\ncredit obligation by the United States of\nAmerica, which, in either case, are not\ncallable or redeemable at the option of the\nissuer thereof. Subordinated Debt Securities\nThe subordinated debt securities will be our\ndirect, unsecured obligations and will rank\nequally and ratably with all our outstanding\nsubordinated indebtedness. The subordinated\ndebt securities will have a minimum weighted\nmaturity of at least five years. Subordination\nOur obligation to make any payment of\nprincipal, premium or interest on the\nsubordinated debt securities, to the extent\nset forth in the subordinated indenture, will\nbe subordinate and junior in right of payment\nto the prior payment in full of all existing\nand future senior indebtedness, as that term\nis defined in the subordinated indenture. Upon\nany distribution of our assets after any\ndissolution, winding up, liquidation or\nreorganization, the -14-\n\nholders of senior indebtedness are entitled to\nreceive payment in full of principal and any\npremium and interest before the holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities are entitled to\nreceive any payment on account of the\nprincipal of and any premium or interest on\nthe subordinated debt securities. In a\nreorganization or readjustment, however,\nholders of the subordinated debt securities\nmay receive our securities or securities of\nany other corporation that are subordinated to\nboth senior indebtedness and any securities\nreceived in the reorganization or readjustment\nby holders of senior indebtedness, except to\nthe extent that any securities so received are\nby their terms expressly not superior in right\nof payment to the subordinated debt securities\n(Section 3.03). Our dissolution, winding up,\nliquidation or reorganization following a\nconveyance, transfer or lease of substantially\nall of our properties and assets in compliance\nwith the terms described above under\n\u0093Consolidation, Merger, Sale, Conveyance and\nLease\u0094 will not be deemed to be a dissolution,\nwinding up, liquidation or reorganization for\nthis purpose (Section 3.03(d)). In addition,\nwe may not pay principal of, or any premium or\ninterest on, the subordinated debt securities\nand may not acquire any subordinated debt\nsecurities for cash or property other than our\ncapital stock if a default on senior\nindebtedness occurs and is continuing that\npermits holders of such senior indebtedness to\naccelerate its maturity and such default is\nthe subject of judicial proceedings or we\nreceive written notice of such default from a\nrepresentative of all holders of the senior\nindebtedness. If we receive any such notice, a\nsimilar notice received within 360 days\nthereafter relating to the same default on the\nsame issue of senior indebtedness shall not be\neffective for such purpose. We may resume\npayments on the subordinated debt securities\nand may acquire them when that default is\ncured or waived or shall have ceased to exist,\nor the senior indebtedness to which such\ndefault relates shall have been paid in full\nin cash or cash equivalents or if that default\nis not the subject of judicial proceedings,\n120 days pass after we receive such written\nnotice (Section 3.02(b)). By reason of this\nsubordination, in the event of our insolvency,\nholders of senior indebtedness may receive\nmore, ratably, and holders of the subordinated\ndebt securities may receive less, ratably,\nthan other of our creditors. However, this\nsubordination will not prevent the occurrence\nof any event of default (Section 3.12). The\nsubordinated indenture does not restrict the\nincurrence of additional senior indebtedness.\n\u0093Senior indebtedness\u0094 means the principal of,\nand premium, if any, on:\n                                              \n      all of our obligations for money        \n      borrowed, whenever created, except:     \n                                              \n                                              \n      such indebtedness as is by its terms    \n      expressly stated to be junior in right  \n      of payment to the subordinated debt     \n      securities, and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      such indebtedness as is by its terms    \n      expressly stated to rank equal or \u0093pari  \n      passu\u0094 in right of payment               \n      with the subordinated debt securities;  \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      any deferrals, renewals or extensions   \n      of any such senior indebtedness.        \n                                              \nLimited Rights of Acceleration Unless\notherwise specified in the prospectus\nsupplement or pricing supplement relating to\nany series of subordinated debt securities,\npayment of principal of the subordinated debt\nsecurities may be accelerated only in the case\nof an \u0093Acceleration Event\u0094 which is defined in\nthe indenture as any of the bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or reorganization events with\nrespect to us that constitute an event of\ndefault. There is no right of acceleration in\nthe case of a default in the payment of\nprincipal of, or any premium or interest on,\nthe subordinated debt securities or our\nperformance of any other covenant in the\nsubordinated indenture. Conversion or Exchange\nIf and to the extent mentioned in the relevant\nprospectus supplement, any subordinated debt\nsecurities series may be convertible or\nexchangeable into other debt securities or\ncommon stock, preferred stock or depositary\nshares. The specific terms on which any\nsubordinated debt securities series may be so\nconverted or exchanged -15-\n\nwill be described in the relevant prospectus\nsupplement. These terms may include provisions\nfor conversion or exchange, either mandatory,\nat the holder\u0092s option or at our option, in\nwhich case the amount or number of securities\nthe subordinated debt securities holders would\nreceive would be calculated at the time and in\nthe manner described in the relevant\nprospectus supplement. Events of Default The\nsubordinated indenture defines an event of\ndefault with respect to any particular series\nof subordinated debt securities as being any\none of the following events unless it is\neither inapplicable to a particular series or\nspecifically deleted or modified for the\nsubordinated debt securities of that series:\n                                              \n      default for 30 days in the payment of   \n      any interest on any of the              \n      subordinated debt securities of that    \n      series;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      default in the payment of the           \n      principal of, or any premium on, any    \n      of the subordinated debt securities of  \n      that                                    \n      series when due; or                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      certain events of bankruptcy,           \n      insolvency or reorganization involving  \n      us or a Principal Constituent Bank      \n      (Section                                \n      5.01).                                  \n                                              \nRights of acceleration in case an event of\ndefault occurs are limited. See \u0093Limited\nRights of Acceleration.\u0094 In case an\nAcceleration Event shall have occurred and be\ncontinuing, the subordinated trustee or the\nholders of not less than 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount (in the case of a series of\nsubordinated debt securities issued at an\noriginal issue discount, calculated in\naccordance with the formula set forth in such\nseries) of the outstanding subordinated debt\nsecurities of that series may declare the\nprincipal (or, in the case of a series of\nsubordinated debt securities issued at an\noriginal issue discount, the amount calculated\nin accordance with the formulas set forth in\nsuch series of subordinated debt securities)\nof all the securities of such series to be\nimmediately due and payable (Section 5.01).\nThe subordinated indenture provides that\nwithin 90 days after the occurrence of a\ndefault with respect to subordinated debt\nsecurities of any series under the\nsubordinated indenture, the subordinated\ntrustee shall mail to the holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities of that series\nnotice of all uncured defaults known to it\nthat have not been waived. The term \u0093defaults\u0094\nincludes events specified above which, after\nnotice or lapse of time or both, would become\nan event of default. Except in the case of\ndefault in the payment of principal of, or any\npremium or interest on, any of the\nsubordinated debt securities of that series or\nin the making of any sinking fund payment or\nanalogous obligation with respect to the\nsubordinated debt securities of that series;\nhowever, the subordinated trustee may withhold\nsuch notice if it in good faith determines\nthat withholding such notice is in the\ninterest of the holders of the subordinated\ndebt securities of that series (Section 5.08).\nSubject to the provisions of the subordinated\nindenture relating to the duties of the\nsubordinated trustee in case an event of\ndefault shall occur and be continuing, the\nsubordinated trustee is under no obligation to\nexercise any of the rights or powers vested in\nit under the subordinated indenture at the\nrequest, order or direction of any of the\nholders of the subordinated debt securities,\nunless such holder(s) offer(s) to the\nsubordinated trustee reasonable security or\nindemnity (Section 6.02(d)). Subject to\ncertain limitations contained in the\nsubordinated indenture, including among other\nlimitations, that the subordinated trustee\nwill not be exposed to personal liability, the\nholders of a majority in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding subordinated debt\nsecurities of all series affected, voting as\none class, have the right to direct the time,\nmethod and place of conducting any proceeding\nfor any remedy available to the subordinated\ntrustee, or exercising any right or power\nconferred on the subordinated trustee (Section\n5.07). No holder of any subordinated debt\nsecurity of any series will have any right to\ninstitute any proceeding with respect to the\nsubordinated indenture or for any remedy\nthereunder unless:\n                                              \n      such holder previously shall have       \n      given to the subordinated trustee       \n      written notice of a continuing event    \n      of                                      \n      default with respect to subordinated    \n      debt securities of that series, and     \n                                              \n-16-\n                                              \n      the holders of not less than 25% in     \n      aggregate principal amount (in the      \n      case of a series of subordinated debt   \n      securities issued at an original issue  \n      discount, calculated in accordance      \n      with the formula set forth in such      \n      series) of the outstanding              \n      subordinated debt securities of that    \n      series shall have made written          \n      request, and offered reasonable         \n      indemnity, to                           \n      the subordinated trustee to institute   \n      such proceeding as trustee, and         \n                                              \n                                              \n      the subordinated trustee shall not      \n      have received from the holders of a     \n      majority in principal amount of the     \n      outstanding subordinated debt           \n      securities of that series a direction   \n      inconsistent with such request and      \n      shall have failed to institute such     \n      proceeding within 60\u00a0days (Section\u00a0     \n      5.04).                                  \n                                              \nThe holder of any subordinated debt security\nwill have an absolute right, however, to\nreceive payment of the principal of, and any\npremium and interest on, such subordinated\ndebt security on or after the due dates\nexpressed in such subordinated debt security\nand to institute suit for the enforcement of\nany such payment (Section 5.04).

Holders of our common stock are\nentitled to receive dividends when, as, and\nif, declared by our board of directors out of\nfunds legally available for\nthe payment of dividends and, upon\nliquidation, to receive pro rata all assets,\nif any, of Truist Financial Corporation\navailable for distribution after the payment\nof necessary expenses and all prior claims.\nHolders of our common stock do not have\ncumulative voting, preemptive, redemption or\nconversion rights. The rights and privileges\nof holders of our common stock are subject to\nany preferences that our board of directors\nmay set for any series of our preferred stock\nthat we may issue in\nthe future.\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our\ncommon stock is Computershare, Inc. Our common\nstock is listed on the NYSE under the\nsymbol \u0093TFC.\u0094\n\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\n\nProvisions of the North Carolina Business\nCorporation Act (the \u0093NCBCA\u0094) and our articles\nof incorporation and bylaws described below\nmay be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect\nand, together with the ability of our board of\ndirectors to issue shares of our preferred\nstock and to set the voting rights,\npreferences and other terms of our preferred\nstock, may delay or prevent\ntakeover attempts not first approved by our\nboard of directors. These provisions also\ncould delay or deter the removal of incumbent\ndirectors or the assumption of control by\nshareholders. We believe that these provisions\nare appropriate to protect\nour interests and our shareholders.\n\nControl Share Acquisition Act. The NCBCA\u0092s\nControl Share Acquisition Act (the\n\u0093Control Share Acquisition Act\u0094) may make an\nunsolicited attempt to gain control of Truist\nFinancial Corporation more difficult by\nrestricting the right of specified\nshareholders to vote newly acquired large\nblocks of\nstock. The Control Share Acquisition Act is\ntriggered upon the acquisition by a person of\nshares of voting stock of a covered\ncorporation that, when added to all other\nshares beneficially owned by the person, would\nresult in that\nperson holding one-fifth, one-third or a\nmajority of the voting power in the election\nof directors. Under the Control Share\nAcquisition\nAct, the shares acquired that result in the\ncrossing of any of these thresholds have no\nvoting rights until they are conferred by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority\nof all outstanding voting shares, excluding\nthose shares held by any\nperson involved or proposing to be involved in\nthe acquisition of shares in excess of the\nthresholds, any officer of the corporation and\nany employee of the corporation who is also a\ndirector of the corporation. If voting rights\nare conferred on the acquired shares, all\nshareholders of the corporation have the right\nto require that their shares be redeemed at\nthe highest price paid per share by the\nacquiror for any of the acquired shares.\n\nNorth Carolina Shareholder Protection Act. The\nNorth Carolina Shareholder Protection Act (the\n\u0093Shareholder Protection\nAct\u0094) generally provides that, unless the\ntransaction satisfies certain minimum fair\nprice (as compared to market price, earnings\nper share and the price paid for shares by the\nacquiror) and procedural requirements, the\naffirmative vote of the\nholders of 95% of the voting shares of a\ncorporation is necessary to adopt or authorize\na business combination with any other entity,\nif that entity is the beneficial owner,\ndirectly or indirectly, of more than 20% of\nthe voting shares of the\ncorporation. The Shareholder Protection Act\napplies to all North Carolina corporations\nthat have not expressly opted out of its\nprovisions in their articles of incorporation\nor bylaws. We have explicitly opted\nout of the provisions of the Shareholder\nProtection Act in our bylaws.\n\n-18-\n\nProvisions Regarding Our Board of Directors.\nOur bylaws provide for a\nboard of directors having not less than three\nnor more than 25 members as determined from\ntime to time by vote of a majority of the\nmembers of our board of directors or by\nresolution by our shareholders. Each director\nis elected\nto serve for a term of one year, with each\ndirector\u0092s term to expire at the annual\nmeeting next following the director\u0092s election\nas a director when a successor may be elected\nand qualified, unless the director dies,\nresigns, retires or is\ndisqualified or removed before that meeting.\nUnder our bylaws, our directors may be removed\nonly for cause and only by the vote of a\nmajority of the outstanding shares entitled to\nvote in the election of directors.\n\nMeeting of Shareholders; Shareholders\u0092\nNominations and Proposals. Under our bylaws,\nmeetings of the shareholders may\nbe called only by our chairman of the board of\ndirectors, chief executive officer, president,\nchief operating officer, secretary or our\nboard of directors. Our shareholders may not\nrequest that a special meeting of shareholders\nbe\ncalled. This provision could delay shareholder\nactions that are favored by the holders of a\nmajority of our outstanding voting securities\nuntil the next annual shareholders\u0092 meeting.\n\nThe procedures governing the submission of\nnominations for directors and other proposals\nby shareholders may also have a deterrent\neffect on\nshareholder actions designed to result in our\nchange of control. Our bylaws require advance\nnotice to our secretary regarding shareholder\nproposals and the nomination, other than by or\nat the direction of our board of directors or\none of its committees, of candidates for\nelection as directors, not later than (1) in\nthe case of an annual meeting, at least 120\ndays but no more than 150 days in advance of\nthe first anniversary of the notice date of\nour proxy statement for\nthe preceding year\u0092s annual meeting; (2) in\nthe case of a special meeting, at least 120\ndays but no more than 150 days in advance of\nthe meeting date of the special meeting;\nprovided, however, if the first public\nannouncement of the date\nof the special meeting is less than 150 days\nprior to the date of the special meeting,\nnotice by the shareholder shall not be later\nthan the tenth day following the first public\nnotice of the date for such special meeting;\nprovided, further, if\nthe special meeting is called for purposes not\nincluding the election of directors, notice by\na shareholder may relate solely to items of\nbusiness and not to nomination of any\ncandidates for election as a director.\nNotwithstanding\nthe notice period specified above, in the\nevent that the date of an annual meeting is\nadvanced by more than 30 days or delayed by\nmore than 60 days from the first anniversary\ndate of the preceding year\u0092s annual meeting,\nnotice by a shareholder\nmust be delivered no earlier than the 150th\nday prior to such annual meeting and no later\nthan the later of the 120th day prior to such\nannual meeting; provided, however, if the\nfirst public announcement date of such annual\nmeeting is less than 150\ndays prior to the date of such annual meeting,\nnotice by the shareholder shall not be later\nthan the tenth day following the public notice\ndate for such annual meeting. With respect to\na shareholder intending to make a proposal\nfor consideration at a meeting, the foregoing\nnotice to the secretary must contain, among\nother information: a description of the\nproposal; the name, address and shareholdings\nof the shareholder submitting the proposal;\nany material interest of the\nshareholder in the proposal; and a\nrepresentation that the shareholder is a\nholder of record of shares entitled to vote at\nthe meeting and intents to appear in person or\nby proxy at such meeting to present the\nproposal. With\nrespect to a shareholder intending to nominate\na candidate for election as a director, the\nforegoing notice to the secretary must\ncontain, among other information: the\naforementioned information required for a\nshareholder proposal; certain\nbiographical information about the nominee;\ninformation about the nominee\u0092s securities\nownership in Truist Financial Corporation; and\na signed statement by the nominee consenting\nto serve as a director if so elected. Failure\nof any shareholder to provide the notice,\ninformation or acknowledgements required by\nthe foregoing provisions in a timely and\nproper manner shall authorize Truist Financial\nCorporation or the presiding officer at the\nmeeting of shareholders before\nwhich such business is proposed to be\nintroduced, or at which such nominee is\nproposed to be considered for election as a\ndirector, to rule such proposal or nomination\nout of order and not proper to be introduced\nor considered.\n\nRestrictions on Ownership. The Bank Holding\nCompany Act requires any bank holding company\n(as defined in that Act) to\nobtain the approval of the Federal Reserve\nprior to acquiring more than 5% of our\noutstanding common stock. Any person other\nthan a bank holding company is required to\nobtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve\nto acquire 10% or\nmore of our outstanding common stock under the\nChange in Bank Control Act. Any holder of 25%\nor more of our outstanding common stock, other\nthan an individual is subject to regulation as\na bank holding company, under the Bank Holding\nCompany\nAct.\n\n-19-\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nUnder our articles of incorporation, we may\nissue shares of our preferred stock from time\nto time in one or more series. Our board of\ndirectors\nis authorized, without action of shareholders,\nto divide the preferred stock into series, to\nprovide for the issuance thereof, and to fix\nand determine the relative rights, voting\npowers, preferences, limitations, and\ndesignations of the shares of\nany series so established, including, without\nlimitation, to determine: (1) the number of\nshares to constitute such series and the\ndistinctive designation thereof; (2) the\ndividend rate, conditions and time of accrual\nand payment thereof,\nand the dividend preferences, if any, between\nthe classes of stock and between the series of\npreferred stock; (3) whether dividends shall\nbe cumulative and, if so, the date from which\ndividends on each such series shall\naccumulate;\n(4) whether, and to what extent, the holders\nof one or more series of preferred stock shall\nenjoy voting rights, if any, in addition to\nthose prescribed by law; (5) whether, and upon\nwhat terms, preferred stock will be\nconvertible into or\nexchangeable for shares of any class or any\nother series of the same class; and (6)\nwhether, and upon what terms, the preferred\nstock will be redeemable and the preference,\nif any, to which the preferred stock will be\nentitled in the event of\nvoluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding\nup of Truist Financial Corporation. This power\nis limited by applicable laws or regulations\nand may be delegated to a committee of the\nboard of directors. Under some circumstances,\nthe issuance of shares\nof our preferred stock, or merely the existing\nauthorization of our board of directors to\nissue shares of our preferred stock, may tend\nto discourage or impede a merger or other\nchange in control of Truist Financial\nCorporation. The preferred stock\nis not secured, is not guaranteed by us or any\nof our affiliates and is not subject to any\nother arrangement that legally or economically\nenhances the ranking of the preferred stock.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, we have authorized\nthe issuance of: (1) 23,000,000 depositary\nshares representing, in the aggregate, 23,000\nshares of Series D Preferred Stock, with a\nliquidation preference of $25,000 per share,\nnone of which are issued and outstanding, (2)\n46,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 46,000 shares of Series E\nPreferred Stock, with a\nliquidation preference of $25,000 per share,\nnone of which are issued and outstanding, (3)\n20,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 20,000 shares of Series F\nPreferred Stock, with a liquidation preference\nof $25,000 per share,\nnone of which are issued and outstanding, (4)\n20,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 20,000 shares of Series G\nPreferred Stock, with a liquidation preference\nof $25,000 per share, none of which are issued\nand outstanding, (5)\n19,550,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 19,550 shares of Series H\nPreferred Stock, with a liquidation preference\nof $25,000 per share, none of which are issued\nand outstanding, (6) 20,000,000 depositary\nshares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 5,000 shares of Series I\nPreferred Stock, with a liquidation preference\nof $100,000 per share, 1,725 of which are\nissued and outstanding, (7) 501,000 preferred\npurchase securities representing, in the\naggregate, 5,010 shares of Series\nJ Preferred Stock, with a liquidation\npreference of $100,000 per share, 1,025 of\nwhich are issued and outstanding, (8) 500,000\ndepositary shares representing, in the\naggregate, 5,000 shares of Series K Preferred\nStock, with a liquidation\npreference of $100,000 per share, none of\nwhich are issued and outstanding, (9) 750,000\ndepositary shares representing, in the\naggregate, 7,500 shares of Series L Preferred\nStock, with a liquidation preference of\n$100,000 per share, all of which are\nissued and outstanding, (10) 500,000\ndepositary shares representing, in the\naggregate, 5,000 shares of Series M Preferred\nStock, with a liquidation preference of\n$100,000 per share, all of which are issued\nand outstanding, (11) 1,700,000 depositary\nshares representing, in the aggregate, 68,000\nshares of Series N Preferred Stock, with a\nliquidation preference of $25,000 per share,\nall of which are issued and outstanding, (12)\n23,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 23,000\nshares of Series O Preferred Stock, with a\nliquidation preference of $25,000 per share,\nall of which are issued and outstanding, (13)\n1,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 40,000 shares of Series P\nPreferred Stock, with a\nliquidation preference of $25,000 per share,\nall of which are issued and outstanding, (14)\n1,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 40,000 shares of Series Q\nPreferred Stock, with a liquidation preference\nof $25,000 per share, all\nof which are issued and outstanding, and (15)\n37,000,000 depositary shares representing, in\nthe aggregate, 37,000 shares of Series R\nPreferred Stock, with a liquidation preference\nof $25,000 per share, all of which are issued\nand outstanding.\n\n-20-\n\nSeries D Preferred Stock\n\nOn August 1, 2019, we submitted a Notice of\nRedemption to redeem all outstanding shares of\nour Series D Preferred Stock and the\ncorresponding depositary shares representing\nfractional interests in the Series D Preferred\nStock.

If this happens, the\ndepositary may, with our approval, sell the\nproperty and distribute the net sale proceeds\nto the holders.\n\nThe deposit agreement will also contain\nprovisions relating to the manner in which any\nsubscription or similar rights offered by us\nto holders\nof the preferred stock shall be made available\nto the holders of depositary shares.\n\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\n\nIf a series of the preferred stock underlying\nthe depositary shares is subject to\nredemption, the depositary shares will be\nredeemed from the\nproceeds received by the depositary resulting\nfrom the redemption, in whole or in part, of\nsuch series of the preferred stock held by the\ndepositary. The depositary shall mail notice\nof redemption not less than 30 and not more\nthan 60 days prior to\nthe date fixed for redemption to the record\nholders of the depositary shares to be so\nredeemed at their respective addresses\nappearing in the depositary\u0092s books. The\nredemption price per depositary share will be\nequal to the applicable fraction\nof the redemption price per share payable with\nrespect to that series of the preferred stock.\nWhenever we redeem shares of preferred stock\nheld by the depositary, the depositary will\nredeem as of the same redemption date the\nnumber of depositary\nshares relating to shares of preferred stock\nso redeemed. If less than all of the\ndepositary shares are to be redeemed, the\ndepositary shares to be redeemed will be\nselected by lot or pro rata as may be\ndetermined by the depositary.\n\nAfter the date fixed for redemption, the\ndepositary shares called for redemption will\nno longer be deemed to be outstanding and all\nrights of\nthe holders of the depositary shares will\ncease, except the right to receive the\n\n-37-\n\nmoney, securities or other property payable\nupon such redemption and any money, securities\nor other property to which the holders of the\ndepositary shares were entitled upon such\nredemption after\nsurrender to the depositary of the depositary\nreceipts evidencing the depositary shares.\n\nVoting the Preferred Stock\n\nUpon receipt of notice of any meeting at which\nthe holders of the preferred stock are\nentitled to vote, the depositary will mail the\ninformation contained in such notice of\nmeeting to the record holders of the\ndepositary shares relating to such preferred\nstock. Each record holder of depositary shares\non the record date, which will be the same\ndate as the record date for the\npreferred stock, will be entitled to instruct\nthe depositary as to the exercise of the\nvoting rights pertaining to the number of\nshares of preferred stock underlying such\nholder\u0092s depositary shares. The depositary\nwill endeavor, insofar as\npracticable, to vote the number of shares of\npreferred stock underlying such depositary\nshares in accordance with such instructions,\nand we will agree to take all action that the\ndepositary may deem necessary to enable the\ndepositary to do so.\n\nAmendment and Termination of Depositary\nAgreement\n\nWe may enter into an agreement with the\ndepositary at any time to amend the form of\ndepositary receipt evidencing the depositary\nshares and any\nprovision of the deposit agreement. However,\nthe holders of a majority of the depositary\nshares must approve any amendment which\nmaterially and adversely alters the rights of\nthe existing holders of depositary shares. A\ndeposit agreement may be\nterminated by us or by the depositary only if\nall outstanding depositary shares relating\nthereto have been redeemed or there has been a\nfinal distribution in respect of the preferred\nstock of the relevant series in connection\nwith any liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up and such\ndistribution has been distributed to the\nholders of the related depositary shares.\n\nCharges of Depositary\n\nWe will pay all transfer and other taxes and\ngovernmental charges arising solely from the\nexistence of the depositary arrangements. We\nwill\nalso pay charges of the depositary in\nconnection with the initial deposit of the\npreferred stock and any redemption of the\npreferred stock. Holders of depositary shares\nwill pay transfer and other taxes and\ngovernmental charges and such other\ncharges as are expressly provided in the\ndeposit agreement to be for their accounts.\n\nResignation and Removal of Depositary\n\nThe depositary may resign at any time by\ndelivering to us notice of its election to do\nso, and we may at any time remove the\ndepositary, any\nsuch resignation or removal to take effect\nupon the appointment of a successor depositary\nand its acceptance of such appointment. Such\nsuccessor depositary must be appointed within\n60 days after delivery of the notice of\nresignation or removal and\nmust be a bank or trust company having its\nprincipal office in the United States and\nhaving a combined capital and surplus of at\nleast $50,000,000.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe depositary will\nforward to the holders of depositary shares\nall reports and communications from us which\nare delivered to the depositary and which we\nare required to furnish to the holders of the\npreferred stock.\n\nNeither the depositary nor Truist will be\nliable if it is prevented or delayed by law or\nany circumstance beyond its control in\nperforming its\nobligations under the deposit agreement. The\nobligations of Truist and the depositary under\nthe deposit agreement will be limited to\nperformance in good faith of their duties\nthereunder and they will not be obligated to\nprosecute or defend any legal\nproceeding in respect of any depositary shares\nor preferred stock unless satisfactory\nindemnity is furnished. The depositary and\nTruist may rely upon written advice of counsel\nor accountants, or information provided by\npersons presenting preferred\nstock for deposit, holders of depositary\nshares or other persons believed to be\ncompetent and on documents believed to be\ngenuine.\n\n-38-\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND\nSTOCK PURCHASE UNITS We may issue stock\npurchase contracts, including contracts\nobligating holders to purchase from us, and us\nto sell to the holders, a specified number of\nshares of our common stock, preferred stock or\ndepositary shares at a future date or dates.\nThe price per share of common stock, preferred\nstock or depositary shares and the number of\nshares of each may be fixed at the time the\nstock purchase contracts are issued or may be\ndetermined by reference to a specific formula\nset forth in the stock purchase contracts.

Except under\nthe limited circumstances described below,\nglobal securities will not be exchangeable for\ncertificated securities. Only institutions\nthat have accounts with DTC or its nominee\n(\u0093DTC participants\u0094) or persons that may hold\ninterests through DTC participants may own\nbeneficial interests in a global security. DTC\nwill maintain records evidencing ownership of\nbeneficial interests by DTC participants in\nthe global securities and transfers of those\nownership interests. DTC participants will\nmaintain records evidencing ownership of\nbeneficial interests in the global securities\nby persons that hold through those DTC\nparticipants and transfers of those ownership\ninterests within those DTC participants. DTC\nhas no knowledge of the actual beneficial\nowners of the securities. You will not receive\nwritten confirmation from DTC of your\npurchase, but we do expect that you will\nreceive written confirmations providing\ndetails of the transaction, as well as\nperiodic statements of your holdings, from the\nDTC participant through which you entered the\ntransaction. The laws of some jurisdictions\nrequire that certain purchasers of securities\ntake physical delivery of those securities in\ncertificated form. Those laws may impair your\nability to transfer beneficial interests in a\nglobal security. DTC has advised us that upon\nthe issuance of a global security and the\ndeposit of that global security with DTC, DTC\nwill immediately credit, on its book-entry\nregistration and transfer system, the\nrespective principal amounts or number of\nshares represented by that global security to\nthe accounts of DTC participants. We will make\npayments on securities represented by a global\nsecurity to DTC or its nominee, as the case\nmay be, as the registered owner and holder of\nthe global security representing those\nsecurities. DTC has advised us that upon\nreceipt of any payment on a global security,\nDTC will immediately credit accounts of DTC\nparticipants with payments in amounts\nproportionate to their respective beneficial\ninterests in that security, as shown in the\nrecords of DTC. Standing instructions and\ncustomary practices will govern payments by\nDTC participants to owners of beneficial\ninterests in a global security held through\nthose DTC participants, as is now the case\nwith securities held for the accounts of\ncustomers in bearer form or registered in\n\u0093street name.\u0094 Those payments will be the sole\nresponsibility of those DTC participants,\nsubject to any statutory or regulatory\nrequirements in effect from time to time. None\nof Truist, the trustee or any of our\nrespective agents will have any responsibility\nor liability for any aspect of the records of\nDTC, any nominee or any DTC participant\nrelating to, or payments made on account of,\nbeneficial interests in a global security or\nfor maintaining, supervising or reviewing any\nof the records of DTC, any nominee or any DTC\nparticipant relating to those beneficial\ninterests. -41-\n\nSecurities represented by a global security\ncan be exchanged for definitive securities in\nregistered form only if:\n                                              \n      DTC notifies us that it is unwilling    \n      or unable to continue as depositary     \n      for that global security and we do not  \n      appoint a successor depositary within   \n      90 days after receiving that notice;    \n                                              \n                                              \n      at any time DTC ceases to be a          \n      clearing agency registered under the    \n      Exchange Act and we do not appoint a    \n      successor depositary within 90 days     \n      after becoming aware that DTC has       \n      ceased to be registered as a clearing   \n      agency;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      we in our sole discretion determine     \n      that the global security will be        \n      exchangeable for definitive securities  \n      in                                      \n      registered form and notify the trustee  \n      of our decision; or                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      an event of default with respect to     \n      the securities represented by that      \n      global security has occurred and is     \n      continuing.                             \n                                              \nA global security that can be exchanged as\ndescribed in the preceding sentence will be\nexchanged for definitive securities issued in\nauthorized denominations of such securities in\nregistered form for the same aggregate amount.\nThe definitive securities will be registered\nin the names of the owners of the beneficial\ninterests in the global security as instructed\nby DTC. The registrar for the securities will\nregister the certificated securities in the\nname or names instructed by DTC. We expect\nthat those instructions may be based upon\ndirections received by DTC from DTC\nparticipants with respect to ownership of\nbeneficial interests in the global security.\nExcept as provided above, as an owner of a\nbeneficial interest in a global security, you\nwill not be entitled to receive physical\ndelivery of securities in certificated form\nand will not be considered a holder of\nsecurities for any purpose under either of the\nindentures. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, no global\nsecurity will be exchangeable except for\nanother global security of like denomination\nand tenor to be registered in the name of DTC\nor its nominee. Accordingly, you must rely on\nthe procedures of DTC and the DTC participant\nthrough which you own your interest to\nexercise any rights of a holder under the\nglobal security or the applicable indenture.\nWe understand that, under existing industry\npractices, in the event that we request any\naction of holders, or an owner of a beneficial\ninterest in a global security desires to take\nany action that a holder is entitled to take\nunder the securities or the indentures, DTC\nwould authorize the DTC participants holding\nthe relevant beneficial interests to take that\naction, and those DTC participants would\nauthorize beneficial owners owning through\nthose DTC participants to take that action or\nwould otherwise act upon the instructions of\nbeneficial owners owning through them. DTC has\nadvised us that DTC is a limited purpose trust\ncompany organized under the New York Banking\nLaw, a \u0093banking organization\u0094 within the\nmeaning of the New York Banking Law, a member\nof the Federal Reserve, a \u0093clearing\ncorporation\u0094 within the meaning of the New\nYork Uniform Commercial Code and a \u0093clearing\nagency\u0094 registered under the Exchange Act.\nClearstream and Euroclear If specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement, investors\nmay elect to hold interests in the global\nsecurities deposited with DTC outside the\nUnited States through Clearstream Banking,\nS.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094) or Euroclear Bank\nS.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System\n(\u0093Euroclear\u0094), if they are participants in\nthose systems, or indirectly through\norganizations that are participants in those\nsystems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold\ninterests on behalf of their participants\nthrough customers\u0092 securities accounts in\nClearstream\u0092s and Euroclear\u0092s names on the\nbooks of their respective depositaries. Those\ndepositaries in turn hold those interests in\ncustomers\u0092 securities accounts in the\ndepositaries\u0092 names on the books of DTC. -42-\n\nClearstream has advised us that it is\nincorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a\nprofessional depositary. Clearstream holds\nsecurities for its participants and\nfacilitates the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions between its\nparticipants through electronic book-entry\ntransfers between their accounts. Clearstream\nprovides its participants with, among other\nthings, services for safekeeping,\nadministration, clearance and settlement of\ninternationally traded securities and\nsecurities lending and borrowing. Clearstream\ninterfaces with domestic securities markets\nin several countries through established\ndepository and custodial relationships. As a\nprofessional depositary, Clearstream is\nsubject to regulation by the Luxembourg\nCommission for the Supervision of the\nFinancial Sector, also known as the\nCommission de Surveillance du Secteur\nFinancier. Clearstream participants include\nunderwriters, securities brokers and dealers,\nbanks, trust companies, clearing corporations\nand other organizations. Clearstream\u0092s\nparticipants in the United\nStates are limited to securities brokers and\ndealers and banks. Indirect access to\nClearstream is also available to other\ninstitutions such as banks, brokers, dealers\nand trust companies that clear through or\nmaintain a custodial relationship with\nClearstream participants. Distributions with\nrespect to interests in global securities held\nthrough Clearstream will be credited to cash\naccounts of its customers in accordance with\nits rules and procedures, to the extent\nreceived by the U.S.\ndepositary for Clearstream.\n\nEuroclear has advised us that it was created\nin 1968 to hold securities for its\nparticipants and to clear and\nsettle transactions between Euroclear\nparticipants through simultaneous electronic\nbook-entry delivery against payment, thereby\neliminating the need for physical movement of\ncertificates and any risk from lack of\nsimultaneous transfers of securities\nand cash. Euroclear provides various other\nservices, including securities lending and\nborrowing, and interfaces with domestic\nmarkets in several countries. Euroclear is\noperated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. under\ncontract with Euroclear plc, a U.K.\ncorporation. Euroclear participants include\nbanks, including central banks, securities\nbrokers and dealers and other professional\nfinancial intermediaries. Indirect access to\nEuroclear is also available to other firms\nthat clear through or maintain\na custodial relationship with a Euroclear\nparticipant, either directly or indirectly.\nDistributions with respect to interests in\nglobal securities held beneficially through\nEuroclear will be credited to the cash\naccounts of Euroclear participants in\naccordance with Euroclear\u0092s terms and\nconditions and operating procedures and\napplicable Belgian law, to the extent received\nby the U.S. depositary for Euroclear.\n\nGlobal Clearance and Settlement Procedures\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus\nsupplement with respect to a particular series\nof global securities, initial settlement for\nglobal\nsecurities will be made in immediately\navailable funds. DTC participants will conduct\nsecondary market trading with other DTC\nparticipants in the ordinary way in accordance\nwith DTC rules. Thereafter, secondary market\ntrades will settle in\nimmediately available funds using DTC\u0092s same\nday funds settlement system.\n\nIf the prospectus supplement specifies that\ninterests in\nthe global securities may be held through\nClearstream or Euroclear, Clearstream\ncustomers and/or Euroclear participants will\nconduct secondary market trading with other\nClearstream customers and/or Euroclear\nparticipants in the ordinary way in\naccordance with the applicable rules and\noperating procedures of Clearstream and\nEuroclear. Thereafter, secondary market trades\nwill settle in immediately available funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding\ndirectly or indirectly through DTC on the one\nhand, and directly or indirectly through\nClearstream customers or Euroclear\nparticipants, on the other, will be effected\nin DTC in accordance with DTC\u0092s rules on\nbehalf of the relevant European international\nclearing system by the U.S. depositary for\nthat system; however, those\ncross-market transactions will require\ndelivery by the counterparty in the relevant\nEuropean international clearing system of\ninstructions to that system in accordance with\nits rules and procedures and within its\nestablished deadlines (European\ntime). The relevant European international\nclearing system will, if the transaction meets\nits settlement requirements, deliver\ninstructions to the U.S. depositary for that\nsystem to take action to effect final\nsettlement on its behalf by delivering\nor receiving interests in global securities in\nDTC, and making or receiving payment in\naccordance with normal procedures for\n\n-43-\n\nsame-day funds settlement applicable to DTC.\nClearstream customers and Euroclear\nparticipants may not deliver instructions\ndirectly to DTC.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits of\ninterests in global securities received in\nClearstream or Euroclear as a result of a\ntransaction\nwith a DTC participant will be made during\nsubsequent securities settlement processing\nand will be credited the business day\nfollowing the DTC settlement date. Those\ncredits or any transactions in global\nsecurities settled during that processing\nwill be reported to the relevant Euroclear\nparticipants or Clearstream customers on that\nbusiness day. Cash received in Clearstream or\nEuroclear as a result of sales of interests in\nglobal securities by or through a Clearstream\ncustomer or a\nEuroclear participant to a DTC participant\nwill be received with value on the DTC\nsettlement date but will be available in the\nrelevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account\nonly as of the business day following\nsettlement in DTC.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have\nagreed to the procedures described above in\norder to facilitate transfers of interests in\nglobal\nsecurities among DTC participants, Clearstream\nand Euroclear, they are under no obligation to\nperform those procedures and those procedures\nmay be discontinued at any time.\n\nAlternative Book-Entry Procedures and\nSettlement\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, book-entry securities denominated\nin currencies other than U.S. dollars may be\nheld, in\nwhole or in part, directly through\nparticipants in the systems of Clearstream or\nEuroclear, or indirectly through organizations\nthat are participants in such systems. Such\nsecurities will be issued in the form of one\nor more global certificates,\nwhich will be registered in the name of a\nnominee for, and shall be deposited with, a\ncommon depositary for Clearstream and/or\nEuroclear.\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe may sell securities to or through\nunderwriters, including broker dealer\naffiliates of Truist, to be designated at\nvarious times, and also\nmay sell securities to dealers or directly to\nother purchasers or through agents. The\ndistribution of securities may be effected at\nvarious times in one or more transactions at a\nfixed price or prices, which may be changed,\nor at market prices\nprevailing at the time of sale, at prices\nrelated to such prevailing market prices or at\nnegotiated prices.\n\nThe debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares and\nwarrants will be new issues of securities with\nno established trading market. It has not\npresently been established whether the\nunderwriters, if any, of these securities will\nmake a market in these securities.\nIf a market in these securities is made by\nthose underwriters, this market making may be\ndiscontinued at any time without notice. No\nassurance can be given as to the liquidity of\nthe trading market for these securities.\n\nThis prospectus, the related prospectus\nsupplement and, if necessary, the related\npricing supplement, may be used by our broker\ndealer\naffiliates for offers and sales related to\nmarket-making transactions in the securities.\nSuch broker dealer affiliates may act as\nprincipal or agent in these transactions.\nThese sales will be made at prices related to\nprevailing market prices at the\ntime of sale or otherwise.\n\nIn facilitating the sale of securities,\nunderwriters may receive compensation from us\nor from purchasers of\nsecurities for whom they may act as agents in\nthe form of discounts, concessions or\ncommissions. Underwriters may sell securities\nto or through dealers, and these dealers may\nreceive compensation in the form of discounts,\nconcessions or commissions\nfrom the underwriters and/or commissions from\nthe purchasers for whom they may act as\nagents. Underwriters, dealers and agents that\nparticipate in the distribution of securities\nmay be considered underwriters, and any\ndiscounts or commissions\nreceived by them from us and any profit on the\nresale of securities by them may be considered\nunderwriting discounts and commissions under\nthe Securities Act. Any such underwriter or\nagent will be identified, and any such\ncompensation received from\nus will be described, in the prospectus\nsupplement and, if necessary, the pricing\nsupplement relating to those securities.\n\n-44-\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned in the relevant\nprospectus supplement and, if necessary, the\npricing supplement, the obligation of any\nunderwriters to purchase the securities will\nbe subject to certain conditions precedent,\nand each of the underwriters with respect to a\nsale of securities will be obligated to\npurchase all of its securities,\nif any are purchased. Unless otherwise\nmentioned in the relevant prospectus\nsupplement and, if necessary, the pricing\nsupplement, any such agent involved in the\noffer and sale of the securities in respect of\nwhich this prospectus is being delivered\nwill be acting on a best efforts basis for the\nperiod of its appointment.\n\nIn connection with an offering of securities,\nunderwriters may\npurchase and sell these securities in the open\nmarket. These transactions may include\noverallotment and stabilizing transactions and\npurchases to cover short positions created by\nunderwriters with respect to the offering.\nStabilizing transactions\nconsist of certain bids or purchases for\npreventing or retarding a decline in the\nmarket price of the securities and short\npositions created by underwriters involve the\nsale by underwriters of a greater number of\nsecurities than they are required to\npurchase from us in the offering. Underwriters\nalso may impose a penalty bid, by which\nselling concessions allowed to broker dealers\nin respect of the securities sold in the\noffering may be reclaimed by underwriters if\nsuch securities are\nrepurchased by underwriters in stabilizing or\ncovering transactions. These activities may\nstabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the\nmarket price of the securities, which may be\nhigher than the price that might otherwise\nprevail in the open market.\nThese activities, if commenced, may be\ndiscontinued at any time. These transactions\nmay be effected on the NYSE, in the over-the-\ncounter market or otherwise.\n\nUnder agreements which we may enter into,\nunderwriters, agents and their controlling\npersons who participate in the distribution of\nsecurities\nmay be entitled to indemnification by us\nagainst certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act.\n\nIf so noted in the\nprospectus supplement and, if necessary, the\npricing supplement, relating to any\nsecurities, we will authorize dealers or other\npersons acting as our agents to solicit offers\nby certain institutions to purchase any\nsecurities from Truist under\ncontracts providing for payment and delivery\non a future date. Institutions with which\nthese contracts may be made subject to our\napproval include commercial and savings banks,\ninsurance companies, pension funds, investment\ncompanies, educational\nand charitable institutions and others. The\nobligations of any purchaser under any of\nthese contracts will be subject to the\ncondition that the purchase of any securities\nshall not at the time of delivery be\nprohibited under the laws of the\njurisdiction to which such purchaser is\nsubject. The underwriters and such other\nagents will not have any responsibility as to\nthe validity or performance of such contracts.\n\nThe participation of Truist broker dealer\naffiliates, including Truist Securities, Inc.,\nin the offer and sale of the securities must\ncomply\nwith the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121\nregarding a FINRA member firm\u0092s distribution\nof securities of affiliates and related\nconflicts of interest. No FINRA member\nparticipating in offers and sales will execute\na transaction in the securities\nin a discretionary account without the prior\nspecific written approval of such member\u0092s\ncustomer.\n\nIf we offer and sell securities\ndirectly to a purchaser or purchasers in\nrespect of which this prospectus is delivered,\npurchasers involved in the reoffer or resale\nof such securities, if these purchasers may be\nconsidered underwriters as that term is\ndefined in the Securities\nAct, will be named and the terms of their\nreoffers or resales will be mentioned in the\nrelevant prospectus supplement. These\npurchasers may then reoffer and resell such\nsecurities to the public or otherwise at\nvarying prices to be determined by such\npurchasers at the time of resale or as\notherwise described in the relevant prospectus\nsupplement. Purchasers of securities directly\nfrom us may be entitled, under agreements that\nthey may enter into with us, to\nindemnification by us against certain\nliabilities, including liabilities under the\nSecurities Act, and may engage in transactions\nwith or perform services for us in the\nordinary course of their business or\notherwise.\n\nUnderwriters or agents and their associates\nmay be customers of (including borrowers\nfrom), engage in transactions with, and/or\nperform\nservices for, us, the senior trustee and the\nsubordinated trustee, in the ordinary course\nof business.\n\n-45-\n\nVALIDITY OF SECURITIES\n\nThe validity of the securities will be passed\nupon for us by Ellen M.

Indemnification of Directors and  \n            Officers.                         \n                                              \nSections 55-8-50through 55-8-58of the North\nCarolina Business Corporation Act contain\nspecific provisions relating to\nindemnification of directors and officers of\nNorth Carolina corporations. In general, such\nsections provide that: (i) a corporation must\nindemnify a director or officer who is wholly\nsuccessful in his defense of a proceeding to\nwhich he is a party because of his status as\nsuch, unless limited by the articles of\nincorporation, and (ii) a corporation may\nindemnify a director or officer if he is not\nwholly successful in such defense if it is\ndetermined as provided by statute that the\ndirector or officer meets a certain standard\nof conduct, except that when a director or\nofficer is liable to the corporation or is\nadjudged liable on the basis that personal\nbenefit was improperly received by him, the\ncorporation may not indemnify him. A director\nor officer of a corporation who is a party to\na proceeding may also apply to a court for\nindemnification, and the court may order\nindemnification under certain circumstances\nset forth in statute. A corporation may, in\nits articles of incorporation or bylaws or by\ncontract or resolution of the board of\ndirectors, provide indemnification in addition\nto that provided by statute, subject to\ncertain conditions. Truist\u0092s bylaws provide\nfor the indemnification to the fullest extent\npermitted by law of any director or officer of\nthe Registrant against liabilities and\nexpenses arising out of his or her status or\nactivities as such, excluding any liability or\nexpenses such person may incur on account of\nhis or her activities which were, at the time\ntaken, known or believed by such person to be\nclearly in conflict with the best interest of\nTruist. Truist\u0092s articles of incorporation\nprovide for the elimination of the personal\nliability of each director of Truist to the\nfullest extent permitted by law. Truist\nmaintains directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability\ninsurance that, in general, insures: (i)\nTruist\u0092s directors and officers against loss\nby reason of any of their wrongful acts and\n(ii) Truist against loss arising from claims\nagainst the directors and officers by reason\nof their wrongful acts, all subject to the\nterms and conditions contained in the policy.\nCertain rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation limit the ability of certain\ndepository institutions, their subsidiaries\nand their affiliated depository institution\nholding companies to indemnify affiliated\nparties, including institution directors. In\ngeneral, subject to the ability to purchase\ndirectors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability insurance\nand to advance professional expenses under\ncertain circumstances, the rules prohibit such\ninstitutions from indemnifying a director for\ncertain costs incurred with regard to an\nadministrative or enforcement action commenced\nby any federal banking agency that results in\na final order or settlement pursuant to which\nthe director is assessed a civil money\npenalty, removed from office, prohibited from\nparticipating in the affairs of an insured\ndepository institution or required to cease\nand desist from or take an affirmative action\ndescribed in Section 8(b) of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b)).\nII-1\n                       \n  Item\u00a016.
