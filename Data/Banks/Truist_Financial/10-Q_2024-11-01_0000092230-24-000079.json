Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company\nupdated its accounting policies in connection\nwith recently adopted accounting standards, as\napplicable, which are described in this\nfootnote. There were no other significant\nchanges to the Company\u2019s accounting policies\nfrom those disclosed in the Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nthat could have a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities\nas held for sale when management, having the\nauthority to approve the action, commits to a\nplan to sell the disposal group, the sale is\nprobable to occur within one year, and the\ndisposal group is available for immediate sale\nin its present condition. The Company also\nconsiders whether an active program to locate\na buyer has been initiated, whether the\ndisposal group is marketed actively for sale\nat a price that is reasonable in relation to\nits current fair value, and whether actions\nrequired to complete the plan indicate it is\nunlikely significant changes to the plan will\nbe made or the plan will be withdrawn. An\nasset or business that meets the criteria for\nheld for sale classification is reported as\ndiscontinued operations when the disposal\nrepresents a strategic shift that has had or\nwill have a major effect on the Company\u2019s\noperating results.\nAssets and liabilities of discontinued\noperations are presented separately in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets for prior periods\ncommencing in the period in which the asset or\nbusiness meets all of the held for sale\ncriteria described above. Net income from\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, is\nseparately reported in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income for current and prior\nperiods commencing in the period in which the\nasset or business meets all of the held for\nsale criteria described above, including any\ngain or loss recognized on the sale or\nadjustment of the carrying amount to fair\nvalue less cost to sell.\nCertain activity of TIH impacting the\nCompany's footnote disclosures has been\nremoved or revised. The footnote disclosures\nincluded herein are presented on a continuing\noperations basis, unless otherwise noted.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information.\nSegment Realignment\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. The segment disclosures\nhave been revised to reflect the new\nstructure. Refer to \u201cNote 18. Operating\nSegments\u201d for additional information.\nReclassifications\nIn addition to the reclassifications discussed\nabove in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,\nConsolidated Statements of Income, and certain\nfootnotes for discontinued operations and the\nsegment realignment, as applicable, certain\nother amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company\u2019s\ncorporate expense allocation methodology was\nenhanced to allocate certain overhead or\nfunctional expenses based on actual OT&C\nnoninterest expense performance. Prior period\nresults have been revised for the CSBB, WB,\nand OT&C segments to conform to the current\nallocation methodology.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nAs a result of the methodology change, CSBB\nnoninterest expense increased $ 43million and\n$ 195million, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively, with\nan off-setting decrease in OT&C noninterest\nexpense.

Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Pronouncements\n                                              \n                 Description                  \n                 Improves                     \n                 reportable                   \n                 segment                      \n                 disclosure                   \n                 requiremen\u2026                  \n                 primarily                    \n                 through                      \n                 enhanced                     \n                 disclosures                  \n                 about          Effects on    \n                 significant    the           \n                 segment        Financial     \n                 expenses.

The decrease in the commercial ALLL\nprimarily reflects a decrease in commercial\nloan balances that was partially offset by an\nincreased reserve rate that included\nincremental reserves related to Hurricane\nHelene. The change in the consumer and credit\ncard ALLL primarily reflects an increase in\nindirect auto and other consumer loan balances\nthat was partially offset by a modest decrease\nin the residential mortgage reserve rate. The\ncommercial ALLL decreased $ 5million, and the\nconsumer and credit card ALLL increased $\n49million in the nine months ended September\n30, 2024. The decrease in the commercial ALLL\nprimarily reflects a decrease in commercial\nloan balances that was partially offset by\nincreases in the reserve rates related to the\nCRE and commercial construction portfolios.\nThe change in the consumer and credit card\nALLL was primarily driven by increases in\nreserve rates related to certain consumer non-\nreal estate portfolios that were partially\noffset by decreases in loan balances and a\ndecrease in the reserve rate related to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include\nunemployment trends, U.S. real GDP, corporate\ncredit spreads, property values, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the September 30, 2024 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2023. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, the\neconomic outlook relative to the prior period\nvaried by economic variable and time period.\nThe economic outlook generally reflected\nmodest improvement in GDP growth and no\nmaterial change in forecasted unemployment\ncompared to the prior quarter. The overall\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nSeptember 30, 2024 included GDP growth in the\nlow-single digits and an unemployment rate\nnear the mid-single digits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s judgment related to\nexpected future credit losses, will continue\nto be an important component of the ACL for\nthe foreseeable future. The September 30, 2024\nACL estimate includes adjustments to consider\nthe impact of current and expected events or\nrisks not captured by the loss forecasting\nmodels, the outcomes of which are uncertain\nand may not be completely considered by\nquantitative models.

First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. Following the realignment\nof these business activities, the Company\u2019s\nthree reporting units with goodwill balances\nare CSBB, WB, and Wealth.\n\nIn conjunction with these realignments,\ngoodwill of $ 1.7billion was realigned to WB\nfrom CSBB based on the relative fair value of\nCSBB and Wealth, and goodwill of $ 220million\nwas realigned to CSBB from WB based on the\nrelative fair value of WB and the realigned\nsmall business banking client segmentation. In\naddition, the Company completed an assessment\nof any potential goodwill impairment for all\nimpacted reporting units immediately prior and\nsubsequent to the realignments and determined\nthat no impairment existed. The quantitative\nvaluation of WB performed in conjunction with\nthese goodwill realignments indicated that as\nof January 1, 2024, the fair value of the WB\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\nless than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of\nthe WB reporting unit may be at risk of\nimpairment.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from January 1, 2024 to\nSeptember 30, 2024, including macroeconomic\nand market factors, industry and banking\nsector events, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nJanuary 1, 2024 quantitative valuations\nassociated with the realignments of goodwill,\nand the sensitivity of the January 1, 2024\nquantitative results to changes in assumptions\nas of September 30, 2024. Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of September\n30, 2024.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill\nattributable to operating segments are\nreflected in the table below. Activity during\n2024 primarily relates to the segment\nrealignment described above and the\ndivestiture of Sterling Capital Management,\nLLC. Refer to \u201cNote 2.

For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the benefit from income\ntaxes was $ 821million compared to a provision\nfor income taxes of $ 794million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, representing\neffective tax rates of 38.1% and 17.7%,\nrespectively. The higher effective tax rate\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024\nwas due to higher full year forecasted\neffective tax rate in the current year,\nexcluding the pre-tax loss from the balance\nsheet repositioning of securities. The tax\nbenefit on the pre-tax loss for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was driven by\nthe discrete impact of the balance sheet\nrepositioning of securities. The Company\ncalculated the provision for income taxes by\napplying the estimated annual effective tax\nrate to year-to-date pre-tax income and\nadjusting for discrete items that occurred\nduring the period.\n                                              \n  NOTE 13.

Changes in\npension plan obligations associated with the\ndisposal of operating segments such as TIH\nrequire the remeasurement of postretirement\nbenefit obligations prior to the disposal,\nupdates to pension plan assumptions inherent\nin valuations, and identification and\nrecognition of valuation changes specific to\nthe sale, including the establishment of a new\nperiodic service cost using assumptions as of\nthe remeasurement date. The remeasurement\nprocess of impacted pension plans included a\nreduction in pension benefit obligations of $\n783million and a loss on plan assets of $\n834million, primarily driven by an increase in\nthe weighted average assumed discount rate\nfrom 5.12% to 5.78%, and a decrease in the\nvalue of plan assets by $ 508million,\nprimarily driven by market prices. The impact\nof the sale on Truist pension plans resulted\nin a reduction of pension benefit obligations\nby $ 97million which was recorded as a\nreduction of AOCI. Refer to \u201cNote 11.

Reference\nassets are typically fixed income instruments\nprimarily composed of syndicated bank loans.\nThe TRS contracts pass through interest and\nother cash flows on the reference assets to\nthe third-party clients, along with exposing\nthose clients to decreases in value on the\nreference assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the reference\nassets. The terms of the TRS contracts require\nthe third party clients to post initial margin\ncollateral, as well as ongoing variation\nmargin as the fair values of the underlying\nreference assets change. The following table\nprovides a summary of the TRS transactions\nwith the associated VIE referenced assets,\nwhich include trading loans and bonds:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Sep 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  VIE          $       1,660    $      1,641  \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  loans and            1,418           1,572  \n  bonds                                       \n  VIE                    325              50  \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n                                              \nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, which could potentially be\nsignificant. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets, and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

The legal proceedings and other\nmatters may be formal or informal and include\nlitigation and arbitration with one or more\nidentified claimants, certified or purported\nclass actions with yet-to-be-identified\nclaimants, and regulatory or other\ngovernmental information-gathering requests,\nexaminations, investigations, and enforcement\nproceedings. Claims may be based in law or\nequity\u2014such as those arising under contracts\nor in tort and those involving banking,\nconsumer-protection, securities, antitrust,\ntax, employment, and other laws\u2014and some\npresent novel legal theories, allegations of\nsubstantial or indeterminate damages, demands\nfor injunctive or similar relief, and requests\nfor fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in Truist\u2019s business practices.\nOur legal proceedings and other matters exist\nin varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, negotiation, or investigation and\nspan our business lines and operations.\n\nThe course and outcome of legal proceedings\nand other matters are inherently\nunpredictable. This is especially so when a\nmatter is still in its early stages, the\ndamages sought are indeterminate or\nunsupported, significant facts are unclear or\ndisputed, novel questions of law or other\nmeaningful legal uncertainties exist, a\nrequest to certify a proceeding as a class\naction is outstanding or granted, multiple\nparties are named, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental entities are involved. As a\nresult, we often are unable to determine how\nor when actual or threatened legal proceedings\nand other matters will be resolved and what\nlosses may be incrementally and ultimately\nincurred. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 37\nTruist establishes accruals for legal\nproceedings and other matters when potential\nlosses become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. Accruals are\nevaluated each quarter and may be adjusted,\nupward or downward, based on our best judgment\nafter consultation with counsel and others. No\nassurance exists that our accruals will not\nneed to be adjusted in the future. Actual\nlosses may be higher or lower than any amounts\naccrued, possibly to a significant degree.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 375million as of September 30,\n2024. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company judged the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nmay change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses, like accruals, are based upon\ncurrently available information and involve\nconsiderable uncertainties and judgment.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the matter\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. These matters are\nnot accrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings and other matters in which\nTruist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint\nasserts claims for violations of civil and\ncriminal usury laws, conversion, and money had\nand received, and seeks damages on a class-\nwide basis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nclass seeks a return of up to $ 452million in\npaid overdraft fees from the 2006 to 2017\nperiod above, plus prejudgment interest which,\nbased on the amount of claimed fees, was\nestimated to be approximately $ 423million as\nof September 30, 2024. A court-ordered\nmediation was held on February 28, 2024, but\nno resolution was reached. On March 4, 2024,\nthe trial court issued an order granting in\npart and denying in part Truist\u2019s motions to\namend the class definition to narrow the scope\nof the class, to compel arbitration against\ncertain class members, and for summary\njudgment. Truist and the class separately\nappealed the trial court\u2019s order to the\nGeorgia Court of Appeals, and oral arguments\nwere held on October 22, 2024.\n\nRecordkeeping Matters\n\nThe SEC and CFTC requested information from\nvarious subsidiaries of the Company that\nconduct broker-dealer, investment adviser, and\nswap dealer activities regarding compliance\nwith applicable recordkeeping requirements for\nbusiness-related electronic communications. In\nAugust 2024, the subsidiaries resolved these\nmatters with the SEC and the CFTC.\n\nInvestigation Regarding Trusts\n\nIn 2016 and 2018, the Civil Division of the\nU.S. DOJ issued subpoenas to a corporate\npredecessor of Truist Bank under the Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement\nAct. These subpoenas requested documents and\nother information related to specified trusts\nfor which Truist Bank serves as trustee. In\nOctober 2024, Truist Bank resolved the matter\nby entering into a settlement agreement with\nthe U.S. DOJ.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule\nto implement a special assessment to recoup\nlosses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in the first half of 2023. The\nassessment is based on an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022. The special\nassessment for Truist is $ 579million, with $\n507million recognized in the fourth quarter of\n2023 and additional adjustments of $ 72million\nrecognized for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 due to changes in the estimated\nrelevant losses to the DIF reported by the\nFDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided\nnotification that the collection period will\nbe extended an additional two quarters beyond\nthe initial eight quarterly installments. The\nspecial assessment will be paid in ten\nquarterly installments, which began in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank, which could result in\nadditional expense.\n\n38 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\ninvestments totaling $ 495million and $\n459million, respectively, have been excluded\nfrom the table above as they are valued based\non net asset value as a practical expedient.\nThese investments primarily consist of certain\nSBIC funds.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nfor brokered time deposit liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques and significant inputs for Level 2\nand Level 3 assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis,\nsee \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures\u201d of the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\nBrokered time deposits : The Company has\nelected to measure certain CDs that contain\nembedded derivatives at fair value. This fair\nvalue election better aligns the economics of\nthe CDs with the Company\u2019s risk management\nstrategies. The Company elects, on an\ninstrument by instrument basis, whether a new\nissuance will be measured at fair value. The\nCompany has classified CDs measured at fair\nvalue as level 2 instruments due to the\nCompany\u2019s ability to observe all significant\ninputs to model-derived valuations in active\nmarkets. The Company employs a discounted cash\nflow approach based on observable market\ninterest rates for the term of the CD and an\nestimate of the Bank\u2019s credit risk. For any\nembedded derivative features, the Company uses\nthe same valuation methodologies as if the\nderivative were a standalone derivative, as\ndiscussed in the \u201cDerivative assets and\nliabilities\u201d section in \u201cNote 18.

The remainder of\nLHFS is carried at fair value.\n\nLoans and leases consist of larger commercial\nloans and leases that are collateral-dependent\nand other secured loans and leases that have\nbeen charged-off to the fair value of the\ncollateral. Valuation adjustments for loans\nand leases are primarily recorded in the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Refer to\n\u201cNote 1.

Partnership\ninvestments are measured based on discounted\nexpected future cash flows. The remaining\nassets are measured at LOCOM, less costs to\nsell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales, or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience, and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

Company\u2019s corporate and\ninvestment banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At September 30,\n2024, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one\nyearto 10years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

                     \n  NOTE 18. Operating Segments                 \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment.\n\nFollowing the segment realignment, Truist\noperates and measures business activity across\ntwosegments: CSBB and WB, with functional\nactivities included in OT&C. The Company\u2019s\nbusiness segment structure is based on the\nmanner in which financial information is\nevaluated by management as well as the\nproducts and services provided or the type of\nclient served.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group,\nrepresenting substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s IH segment, which represented a\nmaterial strategic shift for the Company, and\nas a result, the Company recast results for\nall periods presented under the discontinued\noperations basis of presentation. On May 6,\n2024, the Company completed the sale of its\nremaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the\nprincipal legal entity of the IH segment. As\nthe operations of TIH were included in\ndiscontinued operations prior to the sale of\nTIH, the Company no longer presents the IH\nsegment as one of its reportable segments.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information related to discontinued\noperations.\n\nConsumer and Small Business Banking\n\nCSBB serves consumer and small business\nclients, providing deposits and payment\nservices, credit cards, loans, and mortgages\nthrough an extensive network of branches,\nATMs, digital channels, contact centers, and\nother channels. Lending solutions include\npersonal and unsecured loans originated\nthrough the branch network and digital\nchannels; indirect lending services providing\na comprehensive set of technology-enabled\nconsumer lending solutions including point-of-\nsale offerings for autos, recreational\nvehicles, outdoor power sports, outdoor power\nequipment, and home improvement; and real\nestate lending providing residential mortgages\nthrough its retail, direct, and correspondent\nchannels, with the loans either sold in the\nsecondary market, typically with servicing\nrights retained, or held in the Company\u2019s loan\nportfolio, and home equity loans delivered\nthrough the branch network. CSBB also serves\nas an entry point for clients to access\nservices from other businesses.\n\n48 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nWholesale Banking\n\nWB segment delivers a comprehensive suite of\ntailored solutions with specialized product\nand industry expertise delivered through local\ncoverage of corporate, commercial, and real\nestate clients combined with national coverage\nfrom investment banking and CRE businesses.\nThis segment is focused on providing core\nbanking, cash management, payments,\nspecialized lending, investment banking,\ncapital markets, strategic advisory, and\nmarket-making. In addition to the services\nprovided by Truist\u2019s SEC registered investment\nadvisors, Truist\u2019s wealth professionals\nprovide asset management, trust, brokerage,\nand investment-related services, institutional\ninvestment management, full-service, and\nonline/discount brokerage products, family\noffice services, as well as other wealth\nmanagement disciplines.\n\nOther, Treasury & Corporate\n\nOT&C includes management of the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, long-term\ndebt, derivative instruments used for balance\nsheet hedging, short-term liquidity and\nfunding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement and most bank-owned real estate\nassets, as well as the Company\u2019s functional\nactivities such as finance, enterprise risk,\nlegal, and enterprise technology and\nmanagement, among others. Additionally, OT&C\nhouses intercompany eliminations, including\nintersegment net referral fees and residual\ninterest rate risk.\n\nTruist promotes revenue growth through the\nCompany\u2019s Integrated Relationship Management\napproach, which is designed to deepen client\nrelationships and bring the full breadth and\ndepth of Truist\u2019s products and services to\nmeet clients\u2019 financial needs. The objective\nis to provide Truist\u2019s entire suite of\nproducts to its clients with the end goal of\nproviding clients the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. Revenues of\ncertain products and services are reflected in\nthe results of the segment providing those\nproducts and services and are also allocated\nto CSBB and WB. These allocated revenues\nbetween segments are reflected as net referral\nfees in noninterest income and eliminated in\nOT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include the items as detailed\nbelow.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax\nequivalent basis, related primarily to certain\ncommunity development investments. Recoveries\nfor these allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C. In the\nthird quarter of 2024, the Company\u2019s corporate\nexpense allocation methodology was enhanced to\nallocate certain overhead or functional\nexpenses based on actual OT&C noninterest\nexpense performance. Prior period results have\nbeen revised for the CSBB, WB, and OT&C\nsegments to conform to the current allocation\nmethodology.\n\nAs a result of the methodology change, CSBB\nnoninterest expense increased $ 43million and\n$ 195million, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively, with\nan off-setting decrease in OT&C noninterest\nexpense. For the same reason, WB noninterest\nexpense increased $ 76million and $ 234million\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively, with an off-setting\ndecrease in OT&C noninterest expense.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. When significant changes to\nmanagement reporting methodologies take place,\nthe impact of these changes is quantified and\nprior period information is revised as\npracticable.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 49\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n50 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

We are also subject to direct\nsupervision and periodic examinations by\nvarious governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations that are charged with\noverseeing the kinds of business activities in\nwhich we engage. The regulatory and\nsupervisory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and other customers,\nthe DIF, the broader economy, and the\nstability of the U.S. financial system, rather\nthan for the protection of shareholders and\nnon-deposit creditors. In addition to banking\nlaws and regulations, Truist is subject to\nvarious other laws and regulations, all of\nwhich directly or indirectly affect the\noperations and management of Truist and its\nability to make distributions to shareholders.\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nupdates to significant federal and state laws\nto which Truist is subject since the filing of\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023. These descriptions do\nnot summarize all possible or proposed changes\nin laws or regulations and are not intended to\nbe a substitute for the related statutes or\nregulatory provisions. Refer to \u201cRegulatory\nand Supervisory Considerations\u201d in Truist\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for additional disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule\nto implement a special assessment to recoup\nlosses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in the first half of 2023. The\nassessment is based on an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022. The special\nassessment for Truist is $579 million, with\n$507 million recognized in the fourth quarter\nof 2023 and additional adjustments of $72\nmillion recognized for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 due to changes in the\nestimated relevant losses to the DIF reported\nby the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided\nnotification that the collection period will\nbe extended an additional two quarters beyond\nthe initial eight quarterly installments. The\nspecial assessment will be paid in ten\nquarterly installments, which began in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank, which could result in\nadditional expense.\n\nIn June 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule\nthat significantly modified the required\nfrequency and informational content of\nresolution plan submissions applicable to\ninsured depository institutions with $50\nbillion or more in total assets (\u201cIDI\nResolution Plans\u201d). As a result of the rule,\nTruist Bank is required to submit to the FDIC\na full IDI Resolution Plan every three years\nand an interim supplement in the years in\nwhich a full IDI Resolution Plan is not due.\nThe final rule introduces a new credibility\nstandard for evaluating the adequacy of IDI\nResolution Plan submissions, including\nincreased engagement and capabilities testing.\nThe contours of the FDIC\u2019s application of this\nnew credibility standard remain to be seen and\nmay require the exercise of a meaningful\ndegree of judgment by the FDIC. A failure by\nTruist Bank to satisfy the credibility\nstandard, or any other provision of the rule,\nmay cause the FDIC to require Truist Bank to\nreconsider portions of its IDI Resolution Plan\nor result in an enforcement action by the\nFDIC. The final rule was effective October 1,\n2024. Truist Bank\u2019s first interim supplement\nis due July 1, 2025, and its full IDI\nResolution Plan submission is due July 1,\n2026.\n\nIn August 2024, the FDIC and the FRB issued\nfinal joint guidance regarding resolution\nplans submitted by large bank holding\ncompanies (\u201c165(d) Resolution Plans\u201d). Truist,\nas a domestic triennial full filer, is\nrequired to submit a 165(d) Resolution Plan\nevery three years alternating between full\nplans and targeted plans. Truist\u2019s next full\n165(d) Resolution Plan is due October 1, 2025.\nTruist\u2019s 165(d) Resolution Plan is required to\nreflect the firm\u2019s business operations and\ninterconnectedness and support the goal of\nsubstantially mitigating serious adverse\neffects on the financial stability of the\nUnited States in the event of the firm\u2019s\nfailure. The agencies have proposed a rule\nrequiring large bank holding companies to\nissue long-term debt that would serve as pre-\npositioned resolution resources in the event\nof a firm\u2019s failure. When finalized and\nimplemented, the long-term debt rule may\nimpact Truist\u2019s 165(d) Resolution Plan\nstrategy.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\nIn July 2024, the FDIC released a proposed\nrule to amend its regulations under the Change\nin Bank Control Act, which generally provides\nthat no person may directly or indirectly\nacquire control of an insured depository\ninstitution unless the person has given the\nappropriate federal banking agency prior\nnotice of the proposed transaction and the\nagency has not disapproved it. The FDIC\u2019s\nregulations contain a rebuttable presumption\nthat the acquisition of voting securities of a\nholding company like Truist that directly or\nindirectly controls an insured state nonmember\nbank like Truist Bank constitutes such an\nacquisition of control requiring prior notice\nto the FDIC if, immediately after the\ntransaction, the acquiring person will own,\ncontrol, or hold with power to vote 10 percent\nor more of any class of voting securities of\nthe holding company and other specified\nconditions are met. The proposed rule removes\nan explicit exemption for transactions where\nthe FRB reviews a notice under the Change in\nBank Control Act. In addition, the FDIC seeks\ninformation and comment about its approach in\nresponse to these notices, including the role\nplayed by asset managers and other\ninstitutional investors with FDIC-supervised\ninstitutions. We continue to evaluate this\nproposal and its potential impacts, if adopted\nas proposed, on the Company and Truist Bank.\n\nIn September 2024, the FDIC adopted a final\nstatement of policy regarding its review of\nBank Merger Act applications. The final policy\nstatement addresses, among other things, the\nscope of transactions subject to FDIC\napproval, a more rigorous FDIC process for\nevaluating Bank Merger Act applications, and\nthe FDIC Board's heightened expectations with\nrespect to the Bank Merger Act\u2019s statutory\nfactors. As a result, Bank Merger Act\napplications to the FDIC will now require\nadditional information and transactions that\nwould result in a bank with $100 billion or\nmore in total consolidated assets will be\nsubject to heightened scrutiny. As a result,\nthis new policy and heightened scrutiny will\nimpact any merger transaction in which Truist\nBank is involved.\n\nIn October 2024, the CFPB finalized a rule\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires\ncertain entities, including Truist and Truist\nBank, to, among other things, make available\nto a consumer, upon request, information in\nits control or possession concerning the\nconsumer financial product or service that the\nconsumer obtained from that entity. The rule\nalso requires data providers holding a\nconsumer account, such as Truist Bank, to\nestablish a developer interface satisfying\ncertain data security specifications and other\nstandards, through which the data provider can\nreceive requests for, and provide, specific\ntypes of data covered by the rule in\nelectronic, usable form to authorized third\nparties, including data aggregators. Data\nproviders are prohibited from charging\nconsumers or third parties fees for processing\nthese consumer data requests. The rule also\nplaces certain data security, authorization,\nand other obligations on third parties\naccessing covered data from data providers,\nwhich could include Truist and Truist Bank\nwhen acting in certain capacities. The rule\nrequires third parties to limit their\ncollection, use, and retention of the data\nreceived to only what is reasonably necessary\nto provide the consumers' requested product or\nservice, including uses that are reasonably\nnecessary to improve the product or service.\nThe compliance date for a data provider that\nis a depository institution with over $250\nbillion in total assets is April 1, 2026;\nhowever, the final rule is subject to ongoing\nlitigation that could impact whether and when\nTruist and Truist Bank are required to comply\nwith the rule. We continue to evaluate the\nfinal rule and the potential impacts on the\nCompany.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nIn the third quarter of 2024, we made\nconsiderable progress on driving revenue\ngrowth through our core banking business by\nadding new clients, deepening relationships\nwith existing clients, hiring and developing\ntalented teammates, and investing in\ntechnology and risk infrastructure while\nmaintaining strong expense discipline. The\nCompany expects to continue to make\nsubstantial investments in teammates,\ntechnology, and risk infrastructure while\npursuing its strategic objectives, including\nrevenue growth and expense discipline.\n\nWe also returned $1.2 billion of capital to\nour shareholders through common stock\ndividends and $500 million of common share\nrepurchases during the third quarter of 2024.\nWe have $4.5 billion remaining under our $5.0\nbillion repurchase authorization through the\nend of 2026.\n\nIn July 2024, we successfully completed the\nsale of Sterling Capital Management LLC, an\nasset management business. Cash proceeds and\nthe initial gain recognized on the sale were\nnot material.\n\nHurricanes Helene and Milton affected\nteammates and clients in many communities\nTruist serves. We are working closely with\nthose impacted by these disasters and are\ncommitted to help these communities rebuild.\nTogether, we will continue to deliver on our\npurpose and care for our clients, which fuel\nour momentum and growth.\n\nIn October 2024, our new CIO joined the\nCompany, leading the enterprise technology\nteam. The new CIO has over 25 years of\nexperience across a range of technology roles,\nprimarily in the financial services industry.\nAlso in October 2024, consistent with\nheightened and evolving regulatory\nrequirements and supervisory expectations, the\nBoard refocused the responsibilities of the\nTechnology Committee on technology strategy\nand operations and reassigned responsibility\nfor the oversight of technology risk\nreporting, mitigation strategies, and\ninitiatives to the Risk Committee.\n\n52 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet income available to common shareholders\nfor the third quarter of 2024 of $1.3 billion\nwas up 25% compared with the third quarter of\n2023. On a diluted per common share basis,\nearnings for the third quarter of 2024 were\n$0.99, an increase of $0.19, or 24%, compared\nto the third quarter of 2023.

Net interest margin was\n3.12%, up 20 basis points.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.41%, up 16 basis points and\nthe yield on the average securities portfolio\nwas 2.97%, up 72 basis points, reflecting the\nbalance sheet repositioning and higher average\nmarket interest rates.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was\n2.08%, up 24 basis points. The average cost of\nshort-term borrowings was 5.41%, down six\nbasis points. The average cost of long-term\ndebt was 5.13%, up 62 basis points. The\nincrease in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nNoninterest income was up $149 million, or\n11%, compared to the third quarter of 2023\nprimarily due to higher investment banking and\ntrading income and service charges on\ndeposits, partially offset by lower other\nincome.\n\nNoninterest expense was down $133 million, or\n4.3%, compared to the third quarter of 2023\ndue to decreases in other expense, personnel\nexpense, restructuring charges, and the FDIC\nspecial assessment (reduction of $16 million\nin the third quarter of 2024) (regulatory\ncosts), partially offset by an increase in\nprofessional services and outside processing\nexpense. Restructuring charges decreased $36\nmillion driven by lower severance charges.\nAdjusted noninterest expense, which excludes\nthe FDIC special assessment adjustment,\nrestructuring charges, and the amortization of\nintangibles, decreased $67 million, or 2.3%,\ncompared to the earlier quarter.\n\nThe higher effective tax rate for the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter\nof 2023 is due to higher full year forecasted\neffective tax rate in the current year,\nexcluding the pre-tax loss from the balance\nsheet repositioning of securities.\n\nAsset quality remained strong during the third\nquarter of 2024.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment were 0.48% of loans and leases held\nfor investment at September 30, 2024, up two\nbasis points compared to June 30, 2024.\n\n\u2022 Loans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing totaled $518 million at September 30,\n2024, up one basis point as a percentage of\nloans and leases compared with June 30, 2024.\nExcluding government guaranteed loans, the\nratio of loans 90 days or more past due and\nstill accruing as a percentage of loans and\nleases was 0.04% at September 30, 2024,\nunchanged from June 30, 2024.\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses was $5.1\nbillion and includes $4.8 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $298\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.60%, up\nthree basis points compared with June 30,\n2024.\n\n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $448\nmillion compared to $497 million for the third\nquarter of 2023 primarily reflecting a lower\nallowance build, partially offset by\nadditional reserves related to Hurricane\nHelene.\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off ratio was 55 basis\npoints, up 4 basis points compared to the\nthird quarter of 2023 primarily driven by\nhigher net charge-offs in the other consumer\nand credit card portfolios, partially offset\nby lower net charge-offs in the CRE portfolio.\n\nCapital ratios remained strong during the\nthird quarter of 2024.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s CET1 ratio was 11.6% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, flat compared to June 30,\n2024 as current quarter earnings were\npartially offset by dividends and share\nrepurchases.\n\n\u2022 Truist declared common dividends of $0.52\nper share during the third quarter of 2024 and\nrepurchased $500 million of common stock. For\nthe third quarter of 2024, the dividend payout\nratio was 52%, and the total payout ratio was\n90%.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s average consolidated LCR was 112%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n\u2022 In November 2024, the Company announced the\nforthcoming redemption of all outstanding\nshares of its perpetual preferred stock series\nL and the corresponding depositary shares\nrepresenting fractional interests in such\nseries for $750 million.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 53\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nthird quarter of 2024 was up $65 million, or\n1.8%, compared to the third quarter of 2023\nprimarily due to the balance sheet\nrepositioning.

The change in average\nsecurities was driven by maturities and the\nbalance sheet repositioning. The change in\nother earning assets (increase in balances\nheld at the Federal Reserve) was driven by the\nbalance sheet repositioning.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.41% for 2024, up 37 basis\npoints, compared to the prior period primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates. The\nyield on the average securities portfolio was\n2.72% for 2024, up 54 basis points compared to\nthe prior period, reflecting the balance sheet\nrepositioning and higher market interest\nrates.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $15.9 billion, or\n4.0%, average short-term borrowings were flat,\nand average long-term debt decreased $15.1\nbillion, or 29% due to decreased funding\nneeds.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was 2.07%\nfor 2024, up 57 basis points compared to the\nprior period.

The\nCompany\u2019s business segment structure is based\non the manner in which financial information\nis evaluated by management as well as the\nproducts and services provided or the type of\nclient served.\n\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group,\nrepresenting substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s IH segment, which represented a\nmaterial strategic shift for the Company, and\nas a result, the Company recast results for\nall periods presented under the discontinued\noperations basis of presentation. On May 6,\n2024, the Company completed the sale of its\nremaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the\nprincipal legal entity of the IH segment. As\nthe operations of TIH were included in\ndiscontinued operations prior to the sale of\nTIH, the Company no longer presents the IH\nsegment as one of its reportable segments.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information related to discontinued\noperations.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company\u2019s\ncorporate expense allocation methodology was\nenhanced to allocate certain overhead or\nfunctional expenses based on actual OT&C\nnoninterest expense performance. Prior period\nresults have been revised for the CSBB, WB,\nand OT&C segments to conform to the current\nallocation methodology.\n\nAs a result of the methodology change, CSBB\nnoninterest expense increased $43 million and\n$195 million, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively, with\nan off-setting decrease in OT&C noninterest\nexpense. For the same reason, WB noninterest\nexpense increased $76 million and $234 million\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively, with an off-setting\ndecrease in OT&C

As of September 30, 2024, Truist held or\nserviced the first lien on 33% of its second\nlien positions.\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 16:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Sep 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other    $       8,665    $      7,898  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life                 7,786           7,716  \n  insurance                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension              6,707           6,563  \n  assets                                      \n  Accrued              2,114           2,085  \n  income                                      \n  Accounts             1,600             997  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Leased                                      \n  assets                                      \n  and                  1,472           1,647  \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  DTAs, net            1,393           3,037  \n  Derivati\u2026            1,341             951  \n  assets                                      \n  Prepaid              1,026           1,083  \n  expenses                                    \n  ROU                    920           1,057  \n  assets                                      \n  FHLB                   780           1,198  \n  stock                                       \n  Other                1,172             765  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $      34,976    $     34,997  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       J\u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \nAverage deposits for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $384.3 billion, a decrease of $3.7\nbillion, or 1.0%, compared to the prior\nquarter.\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n1.4% compared to the prior quarter and\nrepresented 27.6% of total deposits for the\nthird quarter of 2024 compared to 27.7% for\nthe second quarter of 2024.

Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of market risk\nmanagement are to minimize adverse effects\nfrom changes in market risk factors on net\ninterest income, net income, and capital, and\nto offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTruist primarily monitors this risk through\ntwo measurement types, (i) NII at risk and\n(ii) economic value of equity, and manages\nthis risk with securities, derivatives, and\nbroader asset liability management activities.\n\nIRR measurement is reported monthly through\nthe ALCO. Monthly IRR reporting includes\nexposure and historical trends relative to\nrisk limit scenarios, impacts to a wide range\nof rate scenarios, and sensitivity tests of\nkey assumptions. IRR reporting is provided to\nthe BRC monthly and reviews of varying IRR\ntopics are performed quarterly.\n\nIRR measurement is influenced by data,\nassumptions, and models. Due to their high\nsensitivity to market rates, mortgage (loan\nand security) prepayments leverage an industry\nmodel that results in varying prepayment\nspeeds across rate scenarios. Prepayments for\nnon-mortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic\nmodels and static prepayment assumptions based\non historical experience. Interest-bearing-\ndeposit rate paid is projected to move at a\nratio (deposit beta) of market rates,\nprimarily the Federal Funds Rate, aligned to\nhistorical experience.\n\nTruist uses derivatives to hedge interest\nincome variability of floating rate loans and\nto hedge valuation changes of long-term debt\nand investment securities.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nNII at risk measures the change in NII under\nalternate interest rate scenarios relative to\nTruist\u2019s baseline scenario, which incorporates\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges as well as expectations for new\nbusiness over the forecast horizon. Truist\u2019s\nbaseline scenario relies on assumptions\nincluding expectations of the economy and\ninterest rates \u2013 which are influenced by\nmarket conditions, new business volume,\npricing, and customer behavior. In measuring\nNII at risk, Truist assumes that changes in\nkey factors, such as prepayments and deposit\npricing (betas), largely move in line with\nthose it has experienced in prior rate cycles.\nHowever, future behavior of key factors may\nvary from those used in this measurement. NII\nat risk measurement assumes, when applicable,\nthat U.S. interest rates floor at zero and\nTruist does not take any balance sheet or\nhedging actions in response to the rate\nscenarios.\n\nTruist evaluates a wide range of alternate\nscenarios including instantaneous and gradual\nas well as parallel and non-parallel changes\nin interest rates.

Truist\nuses EVE as a longer-term measure of interest\nrate risk. Truist performs and monitors\nsensitivity tests of key assumptions used in\nEVE including:\n\n\u2022 Asset prepayment speeds\n\n\u2022 Mortgage spreads (mortgage loan and security\nvaluations)\n\n\u2022 Interest-bearing deposit beta\n\n\u2022 Deposit runoff / decay\n\nKey assumption tests are generally performed\nby increasing and decreasing the assumption,\nwhether static or dynamically modeled,\nrelative to their respective starting values\nand then measuring the resulting impact to NII\nand EVE under baseline and alternate rate\nscenarios.\n\nThe identification and testing of key\nassumptions are influenced by market\nconditions and management views of key risks.\nThe results of key assumption sensitivity\ntests are reported to ALCO and BRC at least\nquarterly. The inventory of key assumptions\nand their associated sensitivity tests are\nreviewed with ALCO and BRC at least annually.\n                                              \n  Market Risk from Trading Activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange, and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a multi-faceted risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule,\nwhich were non-agency asset backed securities\npositions, was $127 million. Consistent with\nthe Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company\nperforms pre-purchase due diligence on each\nsecuritization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including deal structure and\nthe asset quality of the underlying assets,\nthat materially affect valuation and\nperformance. Securitization positions are\nsubject to Truist\u2019s comprehensive risk\nmanagement framework, which includes daily\nmonitoring against a suite of limits. There\nwere no off-balance sheet securitization\npositions during the reporting period.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of September 30, 2024.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to manage market risk include\nstress testing, scenario analysis, and stop\nloss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended September 30,\n2024. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision models including\ntrading market risk models. As part of ongoing\nmonitoring efforts, the performance of all\ntrading risk models is reviewed regularly to\nevaluate model performance with emerging\ndevelopments in financial markets, assess\nevolving modeling approaches, and identify\npotential model enhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a range of stress testing\ntechniques to help monitor risks across\ntrading desks and to augment standard daily\nVaR and other risk limits reporting. The\nstress testing framework is designed to\nquantify the impact of extreme, but plausible,\nstress scenarios that could lead to large,\nunexpected losses. Stress tests include\nsimulations for risk factor sensitivities,\nhistorical repeats, and hypothetical scenarios\nwith varying liquidity horizons of key risk\nfactors. All trading positions within each\napplicable market risk category (interest rate\nrisk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk,\ncredit spread risk, and commodity price risk)\nare included in the Company\u2019s stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios and makes updates on an ongoing\nbasis. Management also utilizes stress\nanalyses to support the Company\u2019s capital\nadequacy assessment standards. See the\n\u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A for additional\ndiscussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and highly\nliquid unencumbered securities, other factors\naffect the ability to meet liquidity needs,\nincluding access to a variety of funding\nsources, maintaining borrowing capacity,\ngrowing core deposits, loan repayment, and the\nability to securitize or package loans for\nsale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client and\ncounterparty demand for funds and collateral\nunder both normal and stressed market\nconditions. In considering its liquidity\nposition, management evaluates Truist\u2019s\nfunding mix based on client core funding,\nclient rate-sensitive funding, and national\nmarkets funding. In addition, management\nevaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding\nsources that mature in one year or less.\nManagement also measures liquidity needs for\nup to one-year of stressed cash outflows for\nTruist and Truist Bank. Management maintains a\nliquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly\nliquid unencumbered securities that is\ndesigned to meet projected 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is conducted for\nTruist and Truist Bank using a variety of\ninstitution-specific and market-wide adverse\nscenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario\napplies defined assumptions to execute sources\nand uses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is designed to meet the projected 30-day\nnet stressed cash-flow needs. Truist\u2019s\nliquidity buffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto address ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR, NSFR, and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient within the parameters of the\nrule to meet their estimated total net cash\noutflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day\nperiod of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes\nof calculating the LCR, is the amount of\nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $84.4 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 112% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 75\nThe NSFR rule defines a minimum amount of\nstable, long-term funding that Truist and\nTruist Bank maintain in relation to their\nasset composition and off-balance sheet\nactivities. Truist and Truist Bank are subject\nto the Category III reduced NSFR requirements.\nAt September 30, 2024, Truist was compliant\nwith this requirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 22:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Sep 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      73,663    $     55,252  \n  FHLB                36,689          24,712  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           72,300          74,717  \n  (after                                      \n  haircuts)                                   \n  Available                                   \n  secured            182,652         154,681  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             34,222          25,085  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     216,874    $    179,766  \n                                              \nAt September 30, 2024, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 5.7 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on and, from time-to-time, potential\nrepurchases or redemptions of a portion of an\noutstanding tranche of the long-term debt of\nthe Parent Company (as may be permitted by the\nterms of each respective series). See \u201cNote\n22. Parent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist seeks to manage cash levels\nat the Parent Company to cover a minimum of\none year of projected cash outflows which\nincludes unfunded external commitments, debt\nservice, common and preferred dividends, and\nscheduled debt maturities, without the benefit\nof any new cash inflows from subsidiary\ndividends to the Parent or capital market\nactivity. Truist seeks to maintain a\nsignificant buffer above the projected one\nyear of cash outflows. In determining the\nbuffer, Truist considers cash requirements for\ncommon and preferred dividends, unfunded\ncommitments to affiliates, serving as a source\nof strength to Truist Bank, and being able to\nwithstand sustained market disruptions that\ncould limit access to the capital markets. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nParent Company had 56 months and 48 months,\nrespectively, of cash on hand to satisfy\nprojected cash outflows, and 33 months and 30\nmonths, respectively, when including the\npayment of common stock dividends.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings. Changes in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings and outlooks during\n2024 include:\n\n\u2022 On May 8, 2024, Moody\u2019s Ratings downgraded\nthe Parent Company\u2019s long-term senior\nunsecured rating to Baa1 from A3 and Truist\nBank\u2019s baseline credit assessment to a3 from\na2 and long-term deposits rating to A1 from\nAa3. In addition, Truist Bank\u2019s short-term\ndeposit rating was affirmed at Prime-1.\nRatings outlooks for both the Parent Company\nand Truist Bank were changed to stable.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist, for the\nParent Company to remain a source of strength\nfor the Parent Company\u2019s subsidiaries, and\nprovide a competitive return to shareholders.\nRisk-based capital ratios, which include CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are\ncalculated based on regulatory guidance\nrelated to the measurement of capital and\nrisk-weighted assets.\n\nManagement regularly monitors the capital\nposition of Truist on both a consolidated and\nbank-level basis. In this regard, management\u2019s\nobjective is to maintain capital at levels\nthat are in excess of internal capital limits,\nwhich are above the regulatory \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d minimums. Truist also regularly\nperforms stress testing on its capital levels\nand is required to periodically submit the\nCompany\u2019s capital plans and stress testing\nresults to the banking regulators. Management\nhas implemented internal stress capital ratio\nminimums that serve as limits which are\nmeasured under internally-developed stress\ntesting scenarios to evaluate whether capital\nratios calculated under hypothetical stress,\nand after the effect of alternative capital\nactions, are likely to remain above internal\nstressed minimums. Breaches of internal\ncapital limits or projected breaches of\ninternal stress capital ratio minimums under\nhypothetical stress result in activation of\nTruist\u2019s capital contingency plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026                                 \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects Truist\u2019s SCB requirement,\nreceived in the 2023 CCAR process, of 2.9%\napplicable from October 1, 2023 through\nSeptember 30, 2024. Beginning on October 1,\n2024, through September 30, 2025, Truist will\nbe subject to a 2.8% SCB received in the 2024\nCCAR process.\n\nTruist completed the 2024 CCAR process and\nreceived a SCB requirement of 2.8% for the\nperiod October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025,\ndown 10 basis points from the SCB requirement\nfor the period October 1, 2023 to September\n30, 2024.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s capital plan rule provides that a\nBHC must update and resubmit its capital plan\nif the BHC determines there has been or will\nbe a material change in its risk profile,\nfinancial condition, or corporate structure\nsince it last submitted the capital plan.\nTruist determined that the sale of our\nremaining equity interests in TIH constituted\nsuch a material change and, therefore,\naddressed the material change in our capital\nplan submitted in April 2024. The capital plan\nrule further provides that, upon the\noccurrence of an event requiring resubmission,\na BHC may not make any capital distribution\nunless it has received prior approval of the\nFRB pending the FRB's consideration of the\ncapital plan resubmission and stress capital\nbuffer requirement.

Repurchased shares revert to the\nstatus of authorized and unissued shares upon\nrepurchase. The share-repurchase program\nenables Truist to acquire shares through open-\nmarket purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1\nplans and other programs, at the discretion of\nmanagement and on terms (including quantity,\ntiming, and price) that management determines\nto be advisable. Actions in connection with\nthe share-repurchase program will be subject\nto various factors, including Truist's capital\nand liquidity positions and related internal\nframeworks, accounting and regulatory\nconsiderations (including any restrictions\nthat may be imposed by the FRB and any changes\nto capital, liquidity, and other regulatory\nrequirements that may be proposed or adopted\nby the U.S. banking agencies), Truist's\nfinancial and operational performance,\nalternative uses of capital, the trading price\nof Truist's common stock, and general market\nconditions. The share-repurchase program does\nnot obligate Truist to acquire a specific\ndollar amount or number of shares and may be\nextended, modified, or discontinued at any\ntime. At September 30, 2024, Truist had\nremaining authorization to repurchase up to\n$4.5 billion of common stock under the Board\napproved repurchase plan.\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \nThe accounting and reporting policies of\nTruist are in accordance with GAAP and conform\nto the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities.\nTruist\u2019s financial position and results of\noperations are affected by management\u2019s\napplication of accounting policies, including\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments made to\narrive at the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities, and amounts reported for revenues\nand expenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition or consolidated results of\noperations, and related disclosures. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nsecurities, MSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and\nderivative assets and liabilities; goodwill\nand other intangible assets; income taxes; and\npension and postretirement benefit\nobligations. Understanding Truist\u2019s accounting\npolicies is fundamental to understanding the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations. The\ncritical accounting policies are discussed in\nMD&A in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSignificant accounting policies and changes in\naccounting principles and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDisclosures regarding the effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are included in\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in this\nreport. There have been no other changes to\nthe critical accounting policies during 2024.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. Following these\nrealignments, the Company\u2019s three reporting\nunits with goodwill balances were CSBB, WB,\nand Wealth. Also in conjunction with these\nrealignments, goodwill of $1.7 billion was\nrealigned to WB from CSBB based on the\nrelative fair value of CSBB and Wealth, and\ngoodwill of $220 million was realigned to CSBB\nfrom WB based on the relative fair value of WB\nand the realigned small business banking\nclient segmentation. In addition, the Company\ncompleted an assessment of any potential\ngoodwill impairment for all impacted reporting\nunits immediately prior and subsequent to the\nreassignments and determined that no\nimpairment existed.\n\nThe quantitative valuations of these reporting\nunits for purposes of realigning goodwill use\nthe income approach and a market-based\napproach, each weighted at 50%. The inputs and\nassumptions specific to each reporting unit\nare incorporated in the valuations, including\nprojections of future cash flows, discount\nrates, and applicable valuation multiples\nbased on the comparable public company\ninformation. The income approach utilizes a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis of multi-year\nfinancial forecasts developed for each\nreporting unit by considering several inputs\nand assumptions such as net interest margin,\nexpected credit losses, noninterest income,\nnoninterest expense, and required capital. The\nmarket-based approach utilizes comparable\npublic company information, key valuation\nmultiples, and considers a market control\npremium associated with cost synergies and\nother cash flow benefits that arise from\nobtaining control over a reporting unit, and\nguideline transactions, when applicable.\n\nTruist also assesses the reasonableness of the\naggregate estimated fair value of the\nreporting units by comparison to its market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime, including consideration of expected\nacquirer expense synergies, historic bank\ncontrol premiums, and the current market.\n\nThe projection of net interest margin and\nnoninterest expense are the most significant\ninputs to the financial projections of the\nCSBB, WB, and Wealth reporting units. The\nlong-term growth rate used in determining the\nterminal value of each reporting unit was 3%\nas of January 1, 2024, based on management\u2019s\nassessment of the minimum expected terminal\ngrowth rate of each reporting unit. Discount\nrates are estimated based on the Capital Asset\nPricing Model, which considers the risk-free\ninterest rate, market risk premium, beta, and\nunsystematic risk adjustments specific to a\nparticular reporting unit. The discount rates\nare also calibrated based on risks related to\nthe projected cash flows of each reporting\nunit. The discount rates utilized for the\nCSBB, WB and Wealth reporting units as of\nJanuary 1, 2024 were 13.0%, 11.5%, and 12.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nThe quantitative valuation of WB performed in\nconjunction with the goodwill realignments\nindicated that as of January 1, 2024, the fair\nvalue of the WB reporting unit exceeded its\ncarrying value by less than 10%, indicating\nthat the goodwill of the WB reporting unit may\nbe at risk of impairment. Circumstances that\ncould negatively impact the fair value for the\nWB reporting unit in the future include a\nsustained decrease in Truist\u2019s stock price, a\ndecline in industry peer multiples, an\nincrease in the applicable discount rate, and\ndeterioration in the reporting unit\u2019s\nforecast.\n\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value. The\nvaluation of the WB reporting unit as of\nJanuary 1, 2024 indicated that if the discount\nrate were increased less than 50 basis points,\nthe reporting unit\u2019s fair value would be less\nthan its carrying value, resulting in a\ngoodwill impairment. Ultimately, future\npotential changes in management\u2019s assumptions\nmay impact the estimated fair value of a\nreporting unit and cause the fair value of the\nreporting unit to be below its carrying value.\nAdditionally, a reporting unit\u2019s carrying\nvalue could change based on market conditions,\nchange in the underlying makeup of the\nreporting unit, or the risk profile of those\nreporting units, which could impact whether\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from January 1, 2024 to\nSeptember 30, 2024, including macroeconomic\nand market factors, industry and banking\nsector events, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nJanuary 1, 2024 quantitative valuations\nassociated with the realignments of goodwill,\nand the sensitivity of the January 1, 2024\nquantitative results to changes in assumptions\nas of September 30, 2024. Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of September\n30, 2024.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 79\n                                              \n  Pension and Postretirement Benefit          \n  Obligations                                 \n                                              \nFollowing the sale of TIH, Truist retained the\npostretirement benefit obligation for TIH\nemployees and changed the status of TIH\nemployees by eliminating their eligibility to\nearn future service credits. Changes in\npension plan obligations associated with the\ndisposal of operating segments such as TIH\nrequire the remeasurement of postretirement\nbenefit obligations prior to the disposal,\nupdates to pension plan assumptions inherent\nin valuations, and identification and\nrecognition of valuation changes specific to\nthe sale, including the establishment of a new\nperiodic service cost using assumptions as of\nthe remeasurement date. The remeasurement\nprocess of impacted pension plans included a\nreduction in pension benefit obligations of\n$783 million and a loss on plan assets of $834\nmillion, primarily driven by an increase in\nthe weighted average assumed discount rate\nfrom 5.12% to 5.78%, and a decrease in the\nvalue of plan assets by $508 million,\nprimarily driven by market prices. The impact\nof the sale on Truist pension plans resulted\nin a reduction of pension benefit obligations\nby $97 million which was recorded as a\nreduction of AOCI.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 15.
