Truist\nto lower prices for its products and services\nin order to maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services, and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional

                                           \nThe financial services industry is intensely\ncompetitive and constantly evolving.\nManagement believes that Truist\u2019s client-first\napproach is a competitive advantage that\nstrengthens the Company\u2019s ability to\neffectively provide financial products and\nservices to businesses and individuals in its\nmarkets. In addition, management has made\nsignificant investments in recent years to\ndevelop Truist\u2019s digital platform and believes\nthat its mobile and online applications are\nhighly competitive in meeting clients\u2019\nexpectations. Legislative, regulatory,\neconomic, and technological changes, as well\nas continued consolidation within the\nindustry, could result in increased\ncompetition from new and existing market\nparticipants. Truist\u2019s subsidiaries compete\nactively with national, regional, and local\nfinancial services providers, including banks,\nthrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers,\nfinance companies, financial technology\ncompanies, and insurance companies. The\nability of non-banking entities, including\nfinancial technology companies, to provide\nservices previously limited to commercial\nbanks has increased competition. Non-banking\nentities are not subject to the same\nregulatory framework as banks and BHCs, and\ntherefore, can often operate with greater\nflexibility and lower costs. In addition, the\nability to access and use technology is an\nincreasingly significant competitive factor in\nthe financial services industry. Having the\nright technology is a critically important\ncomponent to client satisfaction because it\naffects the Company\u2019s ability to deliver the\nproducts and services that clients desire in a\nmanner that they find convenient and\nattractive. Management believes that the\nCompany is well positioned to compete and that\nits continued focus on touch and technology\nwill engender trust among its current and\nfuture clients.\n                                              \n  General Business Development                \n                                              \nTruist seeks to satisfy all of its clients\u2019\nfinancial needs, enabling the Company to grow\nand diversify its sources of revenue and\nprofitability. Truist\u2019s long-term strategy\nencompasses both organic and inorganic growth,\nincluding mergers or acquisitions of\ncomplementary financial institutions or other\nbusinesses.\n                                              \n  Merger and Acquisition Strategy             \n                                              \nThe Company operates a diverse set of business\nlines nationally, with strong market shares\nconcentrated in high growth markets in the\nSoutheast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Truist\nwill continue to pursue strategic mergers and\nacquisitions to enhance growth, when market\nconditions, business objectives,\nprofitability, and market share considerations\nalign to create favorable opportunities. Such\nopportunities might include insurance\nagencies, financial services businesses that\nstrengthen Truist\u2019s capabilities, and banks\nthat enhance Truist\u2019s market position.\n\nTruist\u2019s merger and acquisition strategy\nfocuses on meeting the following criteria:\n\n\u2022 the merger or acquisition must be\nstrategically attractive in that it:\n\n\u25e6 enhances scale and increases revenue via\nexpanded markets and/or products;\n\n\u25e6 improves the client experience; and\n\n\u25e6 solidifies Truist\u2019s position within the\nfuture of banking;\n\n\u2022 the organization must be a good fit with\nTruist\u2019s culture;\n\n\u2022 associated risks must be identified and\nmitigation plans put in place, such that any\nresidual risks fall within Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite; and\n\n\u2022 the transaction must meet Truist\u2019s financial\ncriteria.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Considerations                   \n                                              \nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and the stability of\nthe U.S. financial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and creditors. In\naddition to banking laws and regulations,\nTruist is subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect the operations and\nmanagement of Truist and its ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations, and policies are continually\nunder review by Congress, state legislatures,\nand federal and state regulatory agencies. In\naddition to laws and regulations, state and\nfederal bank regulatory agencies may issue\npolicy statements, interpretive letters, and\nsimilar written guidance applicable to Truist\nand its subsidiaries. Any change in the\nstatutes, regulations, or regulatory policies\napplicable to Truist, including changes in\ntheir interpretation or implementation, could\nhave a material effect on its business or\norganization.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 5\nThe scope of the laws and regulations, and the\nintensity of the supervision to which Truist\nis subject have increased in recent years,\ninitially in response to the financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors,\nincluding technological factors, market\nchanges, climate change concerns, as well as\nincreased scrutiny and possible denials of\nbank mergers and acquisitions by federal bank\nregulators. Regulatory enforcement and fines\nhave also increased across the banking and\nfinancial services sector. Truist expects that\nits business will remain subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws to which\nTruist is subject. These descriptions do not\nsummarize all possible or proposed changes in\nlaws or regulations and are not intended to be\na substitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  General                                     \n                                              \nAs a BHC, Truist is subject to regulation\nunder the BHCA and to regulation, examination,\nand supervision by the FRB. Truist Bank, a\nNorth Carolina state-chartered commercial bank\nthat is not a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, is subject to regulation, supervision,\nand examination by the NCCOB and the FDIC.\nTruist Bank and its affiliates are also\nsubject to examination by the CFPB for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws.\n\nTruist and certain of its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, including those that engage in\nderivatives transactions, securities\nunderwriting, market making, brokerage,\ninvestment advisory, and insurance activities,\nare subject to other federal and state laws\nand regulations, as well as supervision and\nexamination by other federal and state\nregulatory agencies and other regulatory\nauthorities, including the SEC, CFTC, FINRA,\nand NFA. Truist Bank is also subject to\nadditional state and federal laws, as well as\nvarious compliance regulations, that govern\nits activities, the investments it makes, and\nthe aggregate amount of loans that may be\ngranted to one borrower.\n\nExaminations by Truist\u2019s regulators consider\nnot only compliance with applicable laws,\nregulations, and supervisory policies of the\nagency, but also capital levels, asset\nquality, risk management effectiveness, the\nability and performance of management, and the\nboard of directors, the effectiveness of\ninternal controls, earnings, liquidity, and\nvarious other factors. Following those\nexaminations, Truist and Truist Bank are\nassigned supervisory ratings. This supervisory\nframework, including the examination reports\nand supervisory ratings, which are considered\nconfidential supervisory information, could\nmaterially impact the conduct, growth, and\nprofitability of Truist\u2019s operations.\n\nUnder the FRB\u2019s Large Financial Institution\nRating System, component ratings are assigned\nfor capital planning, liquidity risk\nmanagement, and governance and controls. To be\nconsidered \u201cwell managed\u201d under this rating\nsystem, a firm must be rated \u201cbroadly meets\nexpectations\u201d or \u201cconditionally meets\nexpectations\u201d for each of its three component\nratings.\n\nThe results of examinations by any of Truist\u2019s\nfederal bank regulators potentially can result\nin the imposition of significant limitations\non Truist\u2019s activities and growth. These\nregulatory agencies generally have broad\nenforcement authority and discretion to impose\nrestrictions and limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity, including the\nimposition of substantial monetary penalties\nand nonmonetary requirements against a\nregulated entity where the relevant agency\ndetermines that the operations of the\nregulated entity or any of its subsidiaries\nfail to comply with applicable laws or\nregulations, are conducted in an unsafe or\nunsound manner, or represent an unfair,\ndeceptive, or abusive act or practice.\n                                              \n  FHC Regulation                              \n                                              \nTruist has elected to be treated as an FHC,\nwhich allows it to engage in a broader range\nof activities than would otherwise be\npermissible for a BHC, including activities\nthat are financial in nature or incidental\nthereto, such as securities underwriting or\nmerchant banking. While FHCs may engage in\ncertain acquisitions without prior approval of\nthe FRB, any acquisition over $10 billion in\nassets would require prior approval by the\nFRB. In order to maintain its status as an\nFHC, Truist and its affiliated IDI must be\nwell-capitalized and well-managed and Truist\nBank must have at least a satisfactory CRA\nrating. If the FRB determines that a FHC is\nnot well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB\nmay impose corrective capital and managerial\nrequirements on the FHC and may place\nlimitations on its ability to conduct certain\nbusiness activities that FHCs are generally\npermitted to conduct and its ability to make\ncertain acquisitions. If the failure to meet\nthese standards persists, a FHC may be\nrequired to divest its IDI subsidiaries or\ncease all activities other than those\nactivities that may be conducted by BHCs that\nare not FHCs. Furthermore, if an IDI\nsubsidiary of a FHC has not maintained a\nsatisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be\nable to commence any new financial activities\nor acquire a company that engages in such\nactivities, although the FHC would still be\nallowed to engage in activities closely\nrelated to banking and make investments in the\nordinary course of conducting banking\nactivities. Longstanding federal regulations\nrequire a FHC to act as a source of financial\nand managerial strength for its subsidiary\nbanks. In times of severe financial stress,\nthe obligation to serve as a source of\nstrength could cause Truist to commit\nsignificant resources to supporting Truist\nBank that otherwise would be available to\nTruist\u2019s creditors and shareholders.\n\n6 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Resolution Planning                         \n                                              \nAs a Category III banking organization, Truist\nis required to submit to the FRB and FDIC a\nresolution plan every three years with\nsubmissions alternating between a full\nresolution plan and a targeted resolution\nplan. The FRB and the FDIC must review and\nevaluate Truist\u2019s resolution plan. The FRB and\nFDIC are authorized to impose restrictions on\ngrowth and activities or operations if the\nagencies determine that a resolution plan is\nnot credible or would not facilitate a rapid\nand orderly resolution of the company under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and could require\nthe banking organization to divest assets or\ntake other actions if it did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed.\nTruist submitted its inaugural resolution plan\nto the FRB and FDIC in September 2021. On\nSeptember 30, 2022, the FRB and FDIC announced\nthat they did not identify any shortcomings or\ndeficiencies in Truist\u2019s resolution plan. On\nthe same date, the FRB and FDIC also announced\nthat they intend to issue guidance to assist\nCategory II and Category III banking\norganizations in further developing their\nresolution plans, in advance of the next round\nof resolution plans due on July 1, 2024.\n\nIn addition, Truist Bank, as an IDI, is\nrequired by FDIC regulation to file a separate\nbank level resolution plan every three years.\nThe FDIC issued a policy statement in June\n2021 announcing that it will resume requiring\nbank level resolution plans for large banks,\nincluding Truist Bank, and that such bank-\nlevel resolution plans will have more\nstreamlined content requirements than previous\nrequirements. During 2021, Truist Bank was\ninformed by the FDIC that its next resolution\nplan was due on or before December 1, 2022.\nTruist Bank submitted its inaugural IDI\nresolution plan to the FDIC in November 2022,\nwhich is currently under review.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory\nTailoring Rules\n\nCertain U.S. BHCs, including Truist, are\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards. As\nsuch, Truist is subject to more stringent\nliquidity and capital requirements, leverage\nlimits, stress testing, single-counterparty\ncredit limits, resolution planning and risk\nmanagement standards than those applicable to\nsmaller institutions. Certain larger banking\norganizations are subject to additional\nenhanced prudential standards.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Truist is subject\nto the standards applicable to Category III\nbanking organizations, which generally include\nBHCs with greater than $250 billion, but less\nthan $700 billion, in total consolidated\nassets and less than $75 billion in certain\nrisk-related exposures.\n                                              \n  Capital Requirements                        \n                                              \nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to certain\nrisk-based and leverage capital ratio\nrequirements established by the FRB, for\nTruist, and by the FDIC, for Truist Bank.\nThese requirements are based on the capital\nframework developed by the BCBS for\nstrengthening the regulation, supervision, and\nrisk management of banks under Basel III\nrules, as well as certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. These quantitative\ncalculations are minimums, and the FRB and\nFDIC may determine that a banking\norganization, based on its size, complexity,\nor risk profile, must maintain a higher level\nof capital in order to operate in a safe and\nsound manner. Failure to be well capitalized\nor to meet minimum capital requirements could\nresult in certain mandatory and discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken,\ncould have an adverse material effect on\nTruist\u2019s operations or financial condition.\nThese actions could include requiring Truist\nto commit capital to Truist Bank in abnormal\noperating conditions which would otherwise be\navailable to Truist\u2019s creditors and\nshareholders. Failure to be well capitalized\nor to meet minimum capital requirements could\nalso result in restrictions on Truist\u2019s or\nTruist Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or\notherwise distribute capital or to receive\nregulatory approval for acquisitions.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, Truist\u2019s\nand Truist Bank\u2019s assets, exposures, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items are subject to\nrisk weights under the standardized approach\nused to determine the institutions\u2019 risk-\nweighted assets. These risk-weighted assets\nare used to calculate the following minimum\ncapital ratios for Truist and Truist Bank:\n\n\u2022 CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\nCET1 capital primarily includes common\nshareholders\u2019 equity subject to certain\nregulatory adjustments and deductions,\nincluding with respect to goodwill, intangible\nassets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n\n\u2022 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised\nof CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock,\nand certain qualifying capital instruments.\n\n\u2022 Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of total capital, including CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital,\nto risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital\nprimarily includes qualifying subordinated\ndebt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also\nincludes, among other things, certain trust\npreferred securities.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 7\nUnder the FRB\u2019s capital framework for BHCs,\nTruist is subject to capital requirements,\nincluding the SCB, that are determined from\nthe supervisory stress test results. The SCB\nis equal to the greater of (i) the difference\nbetween Truist\u2019s starting and minimum\nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the\nseverely adverse scenario in the supervisory\nstress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount\nof its planned common stock dividends for each\nof the fourth through seventh quarters of the\nplanning horizon as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. The FRB\nassigned Truist an SCB of 2.5%, which is\neffective from October 1, 2022 to September\n30, 2023, at which point a revised SCB will be\ncalculated and provided to Truist. Truist is\nrequired to describe its planned capital\nactions in its CCAR capital plan, but is no\nlonger required to seek prior approval if it\nmakes capital distributions in excess of those\nincluded in its CCAR capital plan. Instead,\nTruist is subject to automatic distribution\nlimitations if its capital ratios fall below\nits buffer requirements, which include the\nSCB.\n\nFor certain large banking organizations, the\nSCB could be supplemented by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently\nset at zero. An FRB policy statement\nestablishes the framework and factors the FRB\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the countercyclical capital buffer. Covered\nbanking organizations would generally have 12\nmonths after the announcement of any increase\nin the countercyclical capital buffer to meet\nthe increased buffer requirement, unless the\nFRB determines to establish an earlier\neffective date. If the full countercyclical\nbuffer amount is implemented, Truist and\nTruist Bank would be required to maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of at least 11.0%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 13.0% to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary incentive compensation\npayments.\n\nCertain large banking organizations with\ntrading assets and liabilities above certain\nthresholds, including Truist, are subject to\nthe Market Risk Rule and must adjust their\nrisk-based capital ratios to reflect the\nmarket risk of their trading activities. Refer\nto the \u201cMarket Risk\u201d section of the MD&A for\nadditional disclosures related to market risk\nmanagement.\n\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to a Tier 1\nleverage ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to quarterly average assets, net of\ngoodwill, certain other intangible assets, and\ncertain other deductions. Category III banking\norganizations are also subject to a minimum\n3.0% supplementary leverage ratio. The\nsupplementary leverage ratio is calculated by\ndividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage\nexposure, which takes into account on-balance\nsheet assets as well as certain off-balance\nsheet items, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure of derivative\ncontracts.\n\nThe FRB has not yet revised the well-\ncapitalized standard for BHCs to reflect\ncapital requirements imposed under the Basel\nIII Rules. For purposes of certain FRB rules,\nincluding determining whether a BHC meets the\nrequirements to be a FHC, BHCs, such as\nTruist, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based\nCapital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total\nRisk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater\nto meet the well-capitalized minimum. The FRB\nmay require BHCs, including Truist, to\nmaintain capital ratios in excess of mandated\nminimum levels, depending upon general\neconomic conditions and a BHC\u2019s particular\ncondition, risk profile, and growth plans. In\nSeptember 2022, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC\nannounced that they are developing a joint\nproposed rule to implement enhanced regulatory\ncapital standards that align with those\nincluded in the Basel III Rules and plan to\nseek public input on the new capital standards\nas soon as possible. Refer to the \u201cCapital\u201d\nsection in MD&A for disclosures containing the\nminimum regulatory capital ratios and well-\ncapitalized minimum ratios applicable to\nCategory III banking organizations.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a\nfinal rule that permitted banking\norganizations to elect to delay temporarily\nthe implementation of CECL until January 2022\nand subsequently to phase in the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital through January\n2025, which Truist elected to use. Under the\nfive-year transition, Truist deferred for two\nyears 100% of the day-one effect of adopting\nCECL and 25% of the cumulative increase or\ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses\nsince adoption of CECL. Following the first\ntwo years, Truist began to phase in the\naggregate capital effects over the next three\nyears consistent with the transition in the\noriginal three-year transition rule.\n                                              \n  Capital Planning and Stress Testing         \n  Requirements                                \n                                              \nIn addition to the regulatory capital\nrequirements, under the FRB\u2019s CCAR process,\nTruist must submit an annual capital plan to\nthe FRB that reflects its projected financial\nperformance under hypothetical macro-economic\nscenarios, including a supervisory severely\nadverse scenario provided by the FRB.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank\nAct stress testing framework also require BHCs\nsubject to Category III standards, such as\nTruist, to conduct company-run stress tests\nand submit to supervisory stress tests\nconducted by the FRB. The company-run stress\ntests employ stress scenarios provided by the\nFRB and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital\nactions, which are intended to normalize\ncapital distribution assumptions across large\nU.S. BHCs. In addition, Truist is required to\nconduct annual stress tests using internally-\ndeveloped scenarios intended to stress the\nunique risk profile of the institution. The\nFRB also conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act\nsupervisory stress tests employing internal\nsupervisory models on the supervisory stress\nscenarios. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to supervisory\nstress testing on an annual basis and company-\nrun stress testing on a biennial basis.\n\n8 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist is required to submit its next capital\nplan and the results of its own stress tests\nto the FRB by April 5, 2023. The FRB is\nrequired to announce the results of its\nsupervisory stress tests by June 30, 2023.\n\nIn addition to the CCAR stress testing for\nTruist, Truist Bank conducts company-run\nstress tests on an annual basis, while only\nrequired biennially.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Requirements                      \n                                              \nCertain BHCs and their bank subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, are subject\nto a minimum LCR. The LCR is designed to\nensure that BHCs have sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets to survive a significant\nliquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar\ndays.\n\nTruist also is subject to FRB rules that\nrequire certain large BHCs to conduct internal\nliquidity stress tests over a range of time\nhorizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid\nassets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity\nstress test, and maintain a contingency\nfunding plan that meets certain requirements.\n\nIn July 2021, Truist became subject to final\nrules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. The NSFR,\ncalculated as the ratio of available stable\nfunding to required stable funding, must\nexceed 1.0x. Available stable funding\nrepresents a weighted measure of a company\u2019s\nfunding sources over a one-year time horizon,\ncalculated by applying standardized weightings\nto the company\u2019s equity and liabilities based\non their expected stability. Required Stable\nFunding is calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to assets, derivatives exposures\nand certain other items based on their\nliquidity characteristics. As a Category III\nbanking organization, Truist and Truist Bank\nare subject to an NSFR requirement equal to\n85% of the full requirement.\n                                              \n  Payment of Dividends                        \n                                              \nThe Parent Company is a legal entity separate\nand distinct from its subsidiaries, and it\ndepends in part upon dividends received from\nits direct and indirect subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist Bank, to fund its activities,\nincluding its ability to make capital\ndistributions, such as paying dividends or\nrepurchasing shares. Under federal law, there\nare various limitations on the extent to which\nTruist Bank can declare and pay dividends to\nthe Parent Company, including those related to\nregulatory capital requirements, general\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices, and federal banking law\nrequirements concerning the payment of\ndividends out of net profits, surplus, and\navailable earnings. Certain contractual\nrestrictions also may limit the ability of\nTruist Bank to pay dividends to the Parent\nCompany. No assurances can be given that\nTruist Bank will, in any circumstances, pay\ndividends to the Parent Company.\n\nThe Parent Company\u2019s ability to declare and\npay dividends is similarly limited by federal\nbanking law and FRB regulations and policy.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from\nmaking capital distributions if they would be\ndeemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice.\nThe FRB has indicated generally that it may be\nan unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay\ndividends unless a BHC\u2019s net income is\nsufficient to fund the dividends and the\nexpected rate of earnings retention is\nconsistent with the organization\u2019s capital\nneeds, asset quality, and overall financial\ncondition. In addition, the Parent Company\u2019s\nability to make capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends and repurchasing\ncapital securities, is subject to the FRB\u2019s\nautomatic restrictions on capital\ndistributions under the FRB\u2019s capital rules.\nTruist\u2019s risk-based capital and leverage ratio\nrequirements are discussed above in the\n\u201cCapital Requirements\u201d section.\n\nNorth Carolina law provides that, as long as a\nbank does not make distributions that reduce\nits capital below its applicable required\ncapital, the board of directors of a bank\nchartered under the laws of North Carolina may\ndeclare such distributions as the directors\ndeem proper.\n                                              \n  Prompt Corrective Action                    \n                                              \nThe federal banking agencies are required to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect\nto FDIC-insured depository institutions that\ndo not meet minimum capital requirements. The\nlaw establishes five categories for this\npurpose: \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d To be\nconsidered \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d an IDI must\nmaintain minimum capital ratios and must not\nbe subject to any order or written directive\nto meet and maintain a specific capital level\nfor any capital measure. An institution that\nfails to remain well-capitalized becomes\nsubject to a series of restrictions that\nincrease in severity as its capital condition\nweakens. Such restrictions may include a\nprohibition on capital distributions,\nrestrictions on asset growth, or restrictions\non the ability to receive regulatory approval\nof applications. The regulations apply only to\nbanks and not to BHCs. However, the FRB is\nauthorized to take appropriate action at the\nholding company level, based on the\nundercapitalized status of the holding\ncompany\u2019s subsidiary banking institutions. In\ncertain instances relating to an\nundercapitalized banking institution, the BHC,\nin its capacity as a source of strength would\nbe required to guarantee the performance of\nthe undercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those\nguarantee commitments.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nIn addition, failure to meet capital\nrequirements may cause an institution to be\ndirected to raise additional capital. Federal\nlaw further mandates that the agencies adopt\nsafety and soundness standards generally\nrelating to operations and management, asset\nquality and executive compensation, and\nauthorizes administrative action against an\ninstitution that fails to meet such standards.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines may subject\na banking organization to a variety of other\nenforcement remedies, including additional\nsubstantial restrictions on its operations and\nactivities, termination of deposit insurance\nby the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver.\n                                              \n  Transactions with Affiliates                \n                                              \nThere are various legal restrictions on the\nextent to which Truist and its non-bank\nsubsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in\ncertain types of transactions with Truist\nBank. Under the Federal Reserve Act and FRB\nregulations, Truist Bank and its subsidiaries\nare subject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit, purchases of\nassets, and certain other transactions\ninvolving its non-bank affiliates. In\naddition, transactions between Truist Bank and\nits non-bank affiliates are required to be on\narm\u2019s length terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                              \n  Acquisitions                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to numerous laws that may\nrequire regulatory approval for acquisitions.\nFor example, under the BHCA, a BHC may not\ndirectly or indirectly acquire ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares\nor substantially all of the assets of any BHC\nor bank or merge or consolidate with another\nBHC without the prior approval of the FRB. The\nBHCA and other federal laws enumerate the\nfactors the FRB must consider when reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC. These factors include the\ncompetitive effects of the proposal in the\nrelevant geographic markets; the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; the effect of the transaction on\nthe financial stability of the United States;\nthe organizations\u2019 compliance with anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved; and the records of performance under\nthe CRA of the IDIs involved in the\ntransaction.\n\nFederal law authorizes interstate acquisitions\nof banks and BHCs without geographic\nlimitation, and a bank headquartered in one\nstate is authorized to merge with a bank\nheadquartered in another state, subject to\nmarket share limitations, regulatory approvals\nand any state requirement that the target bank\nshall have been in existence and operating for\na minimum period of time. The market share\nlimitations impose conditions that the\nacquiring BHC, after and as a result of the\nacquisition, control no more than 10% of the\ntotal amount of deposits of IDIs in the U.S.\nand no more than 30%, subject to variation by\nstate law, of such deposits in applicable\nstates. FRB rules also prohibit a FHC from\ncombining with another company if the\nresulting company\u2019s liabilities would exceed\n10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities\nof all financial companies.\n\nAfter a bank has established branches in a\nstate through an interstate merger\ntransaction, the bank may establish and\nacquire additional branches at any location in\nthe state where a bank headquartered in that\nstate could have established or acquired\nbranches under applicable federal or state\nlaw. These regulatory considerations are\napplicable to privately negotiated acquisition\ntransactions.\n\nThe standards by which bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions are evaluated are\nunder review. Among other things, in July\n2021, an executive order was issued on\ncompetition that requires the banking agencies\nto review the standards for bank mergers, and\nthe Department of Justice has announced that\nit is reviewing its bank merger guidelines. In\nMarch 2022, the FDIC requested information and\npublic input on all aspects of the existing\nregulatory framework that applies to bank\nmerger transactions. Additionally, some\nmembers of Congressional leadership are\nclosely tracking the standards for bank\nmergers and can be expected to engage in\nhearings and public statements in connection\nwith any pending or future merger activity.\nThese reviews and engagements could change the\nstandards for bank mergers.\n                                              \n  Other Safety and Soundness Regulations      \n                                              \nThe FRB has supervisory and enforcement powers\nover BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit activities\nthat represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nconstitute violations of law, rule,\nregulation, administrative order, or written\nagreement with a federal regulator. These\npowers may be exercised through the issuance\nof confidential supervisory actions, cease and\ndesist orders, civil monetary penalties, or\nother actions.\n\nThere also are a number of obligations and\nrestrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI\nsubsidiaries by federal law and regulatory\npolicy that are designed to reduce potential\nloss exposure to depositors and the DIF in the\nevent the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of\nbecoming insolvent. For example, the FRB\nrequires a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and\nto commit financial resources to support such\ninstitutions in circumstances where it might\nnot do so otherwise.\n\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nBanking regulators also have broad supervisory\nand enforcement powers over Truist Bank,\nincluding the power to impose confidential\nsupervisory actions, fines and other civil and\ncriminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver\nin order to conserve the assets of Truist Bank\nfor the benefit of depositors and other\ncreditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to\ntake possession of a North Carolina state bank\nin certain circumstances, including when it\nappears that such bank has violated its\ncharter or any applicable laws, is conducting\nits business in an unauthorized or unsafe\nmanner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition\nto transact its business or has an impairment\nof its capital stock.\n                                              \n  DIF Assessments                             \n                                              \nTruist Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC\nup to the applicable limits, which is\ncurrently $250,000 per account ownership type.\nThe FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium\nassessment system that determines assessment\nrates for an IDI based on an assessment rate\ncalculator, which is based on a number of\nelements to measure the risk each IDI poses to\nthe DIF. The assessment rate is applied to\ntotal average assets less tangible equity, as\ndefined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The\nassessment rate schedule can change from time\nto time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject\nto certain limits. Under the current system,\npremiums are assessed quarterly.\n\nThe FDIC, as required under the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act, established a plan in\nSeptember 2020 to restore the DIF reserve\nratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum\nof 1.35% within eight years. This plan did not\ninclude an increase in the deposit insurance\nassessment rate. Based on the FDIC\u2019s recent\nprojections, however, the FDIC determined that\nthe DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not\nreaching the statutory minimum by the\nstatutory deadline of September 30, 2028\nwithout increasing the deposit insurance\nassessment rates. In October 2022, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule to increase initial base\ndeposit insurance assessment rate schedules\nuniformly by 2 basis points, beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2023. This rule is expected to\nincrease Truist\u2019s regulatory premiums by\napproximately $100 million annually. The FDIC\nalso concurrently maintained the Designated\nReserve Ratio for the DIF at 2%.\n                                              \n  Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations    \n                                              \nIn connection with its lending and leasing\nactivities, Truist Bank is subject to a number\nof federal and state laws designed to protect\nborrowers and promote lending to various\nsectors of the economy and population. The\nCFPB examines Truist and Truist Bank for\ncompliance with a broad range of federal\nconsumer financial laws and regulations,\nincluding the laws and regulations that relate\nto deposit products, credit card, mortgage,\nautomobile, student, and other consumer loans,\nand other consumer financial products and\nservices offered. The federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws that are subject to\nthe CFPB\u2019s supervision and enforcement powers\ninclude, among others, the Truth in Lending\nAct, Truth in Savings Act, HMDA, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collection Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, and Fair Housing Act. The\nCFPB also has authority to take enforcement\nactions to prevent and remedy acts and\npractices relating to consumer financial\nproducts and services that it deems to be\nunfair, deceptive, or abusive, and to impose\nnew disclosure requirements for any consumer\nfinancial product or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by Truist or\nTruist Bank. The regulations could reduce the\nfees that Truist receives, alter the way\nTruist provides its products and services, or\nexpose Truist to greater risk of private\nlitigation or regulatory enforcement action.\n                                              \n  Patriot Act                                 \n                                              \nThe Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the\nability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and\nintelligence communities to cooperate in the\nprevention, detection, and prosecution of\ninternational money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism. The Patriot Act\ncontains anti-money laundering measures\naffecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain\nother financial institutions. The Patriot Act\nincludes the International Money Laundering\nAbatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of\n2001, which requires such financial\ninstitutions to implement policies and\nprocedures to combat money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism and grants the\nSecretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority\nto establish regulations and to impose\nrequirements and restrictions on financial\ninstitutions\u2019 operations. The Patriot Act\nimposes substantial obligations on financial\ninstitutions to maintain appropriate policies,\nprocedures and processes to detect, prevent,\nand report money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and other financial crimes. Failure\nto comply with these regulations may result in\nfines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory\nsanctions, reputational damage, or\nrestrictions on business. In addition, the\nPatriot Act requires the federal bank\nregulatory agencies to consider the\neffectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s\nanti-money laundering activities when\nreviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.\n                                              \n  BSA/AML and Sanctions                       \n                                              \nTruist continues to be subject to examinations\nand ongoing monitoring to assess compliance\nwith BSA/AML laws and regulations. These laws\nand regulations are designed to protect the\nfinancial system by requiring financial\ninstitutions to develop and implement BSA/AML\nprograms designed to detect, deter, and\nprevent the use of the financial system to\nfacilitate the funding of illicit and criminal\nactivities. In addition, Truist is also\nsubject to prohibitions with respect to\nengaging in financial transactions with\ncertain individuals, entities, and countries\nas prohibited by the OFAC regulator of the\nU.S. Treasury.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal financial institution\nregulators, OFAC and law enforcement agencies\nwith respect to AML laws and regulations. This\nenforcement authority includes, among other\nthings, the ability to assess significant\ncivil or criminal monetary penalties, fines,\nor restitution; to issue cease and desist or\nremoval orders; and to initiate injunctive\nactions against financial institutions and\ninstitution-affiliated parties. These\nenforcement actions may be initiated for\nviolations of laws and regulations and unsafe\nor unsound practices.\n                                              \n  Privacy, Data Protection, and Cyber         \n  Security                                    \n                                              \nVarious federal and state laws and regulations\ncontain extensive data privacy and\ncybersecurity provisions, and the regulatory\nframework for data privacy and cybersecurity\nis rapidly evolving. The FRB, FDIC, and other\nbank regulatory agencies have adopted\nguidelines for safeguarding confidential,\npersonal customer information. These\nguidelines require each financial institution,\nunder the supervision and ongoing oversight of\nits board of directors or an appropriate\ncommittee thereof, to create, implement, and\nmaintain a comprehensive written information\nsecurity program designed to ensure the\nsecurity and confidentiality of customer\ninformation, protect against any anticipated\nthreats or hazards to the security or\nintegrity of such information and protect\nagainst unauthorized access to or use of such\ninformation that could result in substantial\nharm or inconvenience to any customer. In\naddition, various U.S. regulators, including\nthe FRB and the SEC, have increased their\nfocus on cyber security through guidance,\nexaminations, and regulations.\n\nAt the federal level, the GLBA requires\nfinancial institutions to implement policies\nand procedures regarding the disclosure of\nnonpublic personal information about consumers\nto non-affiliated third parties. In general,\nthe statute requires explanations to consumers\non policies and procedures regarding the\ndisclosure of such nonpublic personal\ninformation and, except as otherwise required\nby law, prohibits disclosing such personal\ninformation except as provided in the banking\nsubsidiary\u2019s policies and procedures.\n\nIn addition, in November 2021, the FRB, OCC,\nand FDIC adopted a new regulation that, among\nother things, requires a banking organization\nto notify its primary federal regulators\nwithin 36 hours after identifying a \u201ccomputer-\nsecurity incident\u201d that the banking\norganization believes in good faith could\nmaterially disrupt or degrade its business or\noperations in a manner that would, among other\nthings, jeopardize the viability of its\noperations, result in customers being unable\nto access their deposit and other accounts,\nresult in a material loss of revenue, profit\nor franchise value, or pose a threat to the\nfinancial stability of the U.S.\n\nStates are also increasingly proposing or\nenacting legislation that relates to data\nprivacy and data protection such as the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act. Truist has\nundertaken significant efforts to comply with\nthese laws and continues to assess their\nrequirements and applicability to Truist.\nThese laws and proposed legislation are still\nsubject to revision or formal guidance and may\nbe interpreted or applied in a manner\ninconsistent with the Company\u2019s understanding.\nCalifornia voters also recently passed the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, which became\neffective on January 1, 2023, and\nsignificantly modifies the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act, including by imposing additional\nobligations on covered companies and expanding\nCalifornia consumers\u2019 rights with respect to\ncertain sensitive personal information,\npotentially resulting in further uncertainty\nand requiring Truist to incur additional costs\nto comply. Truist may be subject to similar\nlaws in other states where Truist does\nbusiness or in states where Truist may collect\npersonal information of residents.\n\nIn addition, the promulgation in 2017 of the\nNew York Department of Financial Services\nCybersecurity Regulation, which was proposed\nto be updated in November 2022, and the\nNational Association of Insurance\nCommissioners Insurance Data Security Model\nLaw are driving significant cybersecurity\ncompliance activities for Truist. Both of\nthese regulations include phased compliance\nperiods as well as attestation of compliance\nby Truist.\n\nLike other lenders, Truist Bank uses credit\nbureau data in its underwriting activities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates\nreporting information to credit bureaus,\nprescreening individuals for credit offers,\nsharing of information between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate data for marketing purposes.\nSimilar state laws may impose additional\nrequirements on Truist Bank. Truist is also\nsubject to rules and regulations issued by the\nFederal Trade Commission, which regulates\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices,\nincluding with respect to data privacy and\ncybersecurity. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has\nrecently considered, and is currently\nconsidering various proposals for more\ncomprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity\nlegislation, to which we may be subject if\npassed.\n                                              \n  CRA                                         \n                                              \nThe CRA requires Truist Bank\u2019s primary federal\nbank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess\nthe bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs\nof the communities served by the bank,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods and persons. Institutions are\nassigned one of four ratings: \u201cOutstanding,\u201d\n\u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve,\u201d or\n\u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d This assessment\nis considered for any bank that applies to\nmerge or consolidate with or acquire the\nassets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or\nto open or relocate a branch office. The CRA\nrecord of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also\nis assessed by the FRB in connection with\nreviewing any proposed acquisition or merger\napplication. For its most recent CRA\nexamination period, Truist received the\nhighest possible overall rating of\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d from the FDIC.\n\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn June 2022, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued a\njoint proposal to amend their regulations\nimplementing the CRA. The proposed rules would\nmaterially revise the current CRA framework,\nincluding new assessment area requirements,\nnew methods of calculating credit for lending,\ninvestment and service activities, and\nadditional data collection and reporting\nrequirements. The proposed rule included\nanalysis indicating a significant increase in\nthe thresholds for large banks to receive\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d ratings in the future.\n                                              \n  Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation      \n                                              \nThere are federal consumer protection laws\nrelated to automated overdraft payment\nprograms offered by financial institutions.\nThe CFPB prohibits financial institutions from\ncharging consumers fees for paying overdrafts\non automated teller machine and one-time debit\ncard transactions, unless a consumer consents,\nor opts in, to the overdraft service.\nFinancial institutions must also provide\nconsumers with a notice that explains the\nfinancial institution\u2019s overdraft services,\nincluding the associated fees and the\nconsumer\u2019s choices. In addition, FDIC-\nsupervised institutions must monitor overdraft\npayment programs for \u201cexcessive or chronic\u201d\nclient use and undertake \u201cmeaningful and\neffective\u201d follow-up action with clients that\noverdraw their accounts more than six times\nduring a rolling 12-month period. Financial\ninstitutions must also impose daily limits on\noverdraft charges, review and modify check-\nclearing procedures, prominently distinguish\naccount balances from available overdraft\ncoverage amounts, and ensure board and\nmanagement oversight regarding overdraft\npayment programs. In 2022, Truist launched a\nnew approach to the checking account\nexperience, designed to address clients\u2019\ndirect feedback, which includes no overdraft\nfees.\n                                              \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nTruist is prohibited under the Volcker Rule\nfrom (i) engaging in proprietary trading\nactivities, and (ii) having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with covered\nprivate funds. The fundamental prohibitions of\nthe Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of\nany size, including Truist and its affiliates.\nThe Volcker Rule regulations contain\nexemptions or exclusions, including for\nmarket-making, hedging, underwriting, trading\nin U.S. government and agency obligations and\nalso permit certain ownership interests in\ncertain types of funds. They also permit the\noffering and sponsoring of funds under certain\nconditions. The Volcker Rule regulations\nimpose significant compliance obligations on\nbanking entities. Truist has put in place the\ncompliance programs required by the Volcker\nRule and has either divested or received\nextensions for any holdings in illiquid funds.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Regime for Swaps                 \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive\nregulatory regime for the OTC swaps market,\naimed at increasing transparency, and reducing\nsystemic risk in the derivatives markets,\nincluding requirements for central clearing,\nexchange trading, capital adequacy, margin,\nreporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank\nAct requires that certain swap dealers and\nsecurity-based swap dealers register with one\nor both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the\nnature of the swaps business. Truist Bank\nprovisionally registered with the CFTC as a\nswap dealer, subjecting Truist Bank to\nrequirements under the CFTC\u2019s regulatory\nregime, including trade reporting and\nrecordkeeping requirements, business conduct\nrequirements (including daily valuations,\ndisclosure of material risks associated with\nswaps and disclosure of material incentives\nand conflicts of interest), and mandatory\nclearing and exchange trading requirements for\ncertain standardized swaps designated by the\nCFTC. The NFA is the primary self-regulatory\norganization for Truist\u2019s swap dealer.\n\nIn November 2021, Truist Bank conditionally\nregistered with the SEC as a security-based\nswap dealer. As a result, Truist Bank\u2019s\nsecurity-based swaps business is now subject\nto requirements that are similar to the CFTC\nrules applicable to swap dealers, including\ntrade reporting, business conduct standards,\nrecordkeeping, and clearing and exchange\ntrading requirements.\n\nTruist Bank\u2019s uncleared swaps and security-\nbased swaps are subject to variation margin\nand initial margin requirements, which have\nbeen fully phased-in across the industry as of\nSeptember 2022.\n                                              \n  Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser        \n  Regulation                                  \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulation by the\nSEC. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory\norganization for Truist\u2019s registered broker-\ndealer subsidiaries. Truist\u2019s broker-dealer\nand investment adviser subsidiaries also are\nsubject to additional regulation by states or\nlocal jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have\nactive enforcement functions that oversee\nbroker-dealers and investment advisers and can\nbring actions that result in fines,\nrestitution, a limitation on permitted\nactivities, disqualification to continue to\nconduct certain activities and an inability to\nrely on certain favorable exemptions.

If these individuals leave or\nchange their roles without effective\nreplacements, operations may suffer.\n\n\u2022 The Company depends on the ability to\nattract and retain qualified teammates while\neffectively managing recruiting and\ncompensation costs amid highly competitive and\nrapidly changing market conditions in order to\nimplement and execute upon business\nstrategies.\n\n\u2022 The Company\u2019s operations rely on its\nability, and the ability of key external\nparties, to maintain appropriately staffed\nworkforces, and on the competence,\ntrustworthiness, health and safety of\nemployees.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \n\u2022 There are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in Truist\u2019s business, which may\nimpact decisions made by Management and\nregulators.\n\n\u2022 The Company\u2019s accounting policies and\nprocesses are critical to how the Company\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations and require management to make\nestimates about matters that are uncertain.\n\n\u2022 Depressed market values for the Company\u2019s\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company\u2019s goodwill.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 19\n                                              \n  Operational Risks                           \n                                              \n\u2022 Truist relies on other companies to provide\nkey components of the Company\u2019s business\ninfrastructure.\n\n\u2022 The Company\u2019s framework for managing risks\nmay not be effective.\n\n\u2022 Truist depends on the accuracy and\ncompleteness of information about clients and\ncounterparties.\n\n\u2022 Truist can be negatively affected if it\nfails to identify and address operational\nrisks associated with the introduction of or\nchanges to products, services, and delivery\nplatforms.\n\n\u2022 Enhanced regulatory and other standards for\nthe oversight of vendors and other service\nproviders can result in higher costs and other\npotential exposures.\n\nThe following discussion sets forth some of\nthe more important risk factors that could\nmaterially affect Truist\u2019s financial condition\nand operations. When a risk factor spans\nseveral risk categories, the risks have been\nlisted by their primary risk category. The\nrisks described are not all inclusive.\nAdditional risks that are not presently known\nor risks deemed immaterial may have a material\nadverse effect on Truist\u2019s financial\ncondition, results of operations, business,\nand prospects.\n                                              \n  Market Risks                                \n                                              \nChanges in interest rates could adversely\naffect revenue and expenses, the value of\nassets and liabilities, as well as the\navailability and cost of capital, and\nliquidity.\n\nTruist\u2019s balance sheet can be sensitive to\nmovements in market interest rates and\nspreads. In addition to the impact of the\ngeneral economy, changes in interest rates or\nin valuations in the debt or equity markets\ncould directly impact the Company in one or\nmore of the following ways:\n\n\u2022 The yield on earning assets and rates paid\non interest-bearing liabilities may change in\ndisproportionate ways; or\n\n\u2022 The value of financial instruments held\ncould change adversely.\n\nNational, regional, and local economic\nconditions, competitive pressures and the\npolicies of regulatory authorities affect\ninterest income and interest expense. When\ninterest rates rise, funding costs may rise\nfaster than the yield the Company earns on\nassets, causing net interest margin to\ncontract. Higher interest rates may also\nresult in lower mortgage production income and\nelevated charge-offs in certain categories of\nthe loan portfolio. Conversely, when interest\nrates fall, the yield the Company earns on\nassets may fall faster than the Company\u2019s\nability to lower rates paid on deposits or\nborrowings.\n\nCertain investment securities, notably MBS,\nare very sensitive to changes in rates.\nGenerally, when rates rise, market values will\ndecline, prepayments will decrease and the\nduration of MBS will increase. Conversely,\nwhen rates fall, market values will rise,\nprepayments of principal and interest will\nincrease and the duration of MBS will\ndecrease.\n\nThe monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S.\nfederal government could have a material\nadverse effect on profitability.\n\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies,\nincluding FRB policies, can adversely affect\nprofitability and cannot be controlled or\npredicted by the Company. FRB policies can:\n\n\u2022 significantly impact the cost of funds, as\nwell as the return on assets, both of which\ncan have an impact on interest income;\n\n\u2022 materially affect the value of financial\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect borrowers through higher\ndebt servicing costs and potentially increase\nthe risk that they may fail to repay their\nloan obligations; and\n\n\u2022 artificially inflate asset values during\nprolonged periods of accommodative policy,\nwhich could in turn cause volatile markets and\nrapidly declining collateral values during\ntimes of restrictive monetary and fiscal\npolicies.\n\nThe FRB raised interest rates significantly\nand began shrinking its balance sheet during\n2022 in response to inflation measures that\nwere well above the FRB\u2019s two percent target.\nThe Federal Reserve may further increase\ninterest rates in the near term. Sustained\nhigher interest rates and continued FRB asset\nreductions may adversely affect market\nstability, market liquidity and the Company\u2019s\nfinancial performance and condition. Truist\ncannot predict the nature or timing of future\nchanges in monetary policies or the precise\neffects such changes may have on the Company\u2019s\nactivities and financial results.\n\n20 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInflation could negatively impact our\nbusiness, our profitability, and our stock\nprice.\n\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact our\nprofitability by negatively impacting our\nfixed costs and expenses, including increasing\nfunding costs and expense related to talent\nacquisition and retention. Additionally,\ninflation may lead to a decrease in consumer\nand clients\u2019 purchasing power and negatively\naffect the need or demand for our products and\nservices. If significant inflation continues,\nour business could be negatively affected by,\namong other things, increased default rates\nleading to credit losses which could decrease\nour appetite for new credit extensions. These\ninflationary pressures could result in missed\nearnings and budgetary projections causing our\nstock price to suffer.\n\nFinancial results, lending or other business\nactivities could be materially affected by a\ndeterioration of economic conditions.\n\nA prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S.\neconomy as a whole or in any regional markets\nthat Truist serves, or any deterioration in\neconomic conditions or the financial markets\nmay disrupt or dampen the economy, which could\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results.\n\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, the\nCompany may see lower demand for loans by\ncreditworthy clients, reducing the Company\u2019s\ninterest income. In addition, if unemployment\nlevels increase or if real estate prices\ndecrease, the Company could incur higher\ncharge-offs and may incur higher expenses in\nconnection with adverse conditions in the\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used to\nestimate the allowance for credit losses in\naccordance with CECL requirements. These\nconditions may adversely affect not only\nconsumer borrowers but also commercial and\nindustrial and commercial real estate\nborrowers, especially for those businesses\nthat rely on the health of industries or\nproperties that may suffer from deteriorating\neconomic conditions. The ability of these\nborrowers to repay their loans may be reduced,\ncausing the Company to incur higher credit\nlosses.\n\nThe deterioration of economic conditions also\ncould adversely affect financial results for\nthe Company\u2019s fee-based businesses. Truist\nearns fee income from, among other activities,\nmanaging assets for clients, and providing\nbrokerage and other investment advisory and\nwealth management services. Investment\nmanagement fees are often based on the value\nof assets under management and a decrease in\nthe market prices of those assets could reduce\nthe Company\u2019s fee income. Changes in stock or\nfixed income market prices or client\npreferences could affect the trading activity\nof investors, reducing commissions and other\nfees earned from the Company\u2019s brokerage\nbusiness. Poor economic conditions and\nvolatile or unstable financial markets would\nlikely adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital\nmarkets-related businesses.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition. The\nmacroeconomic environment in the United States\nis susceptible to global events and volatility\nin financial markets. For example, trade\nnegotiations between the U.S. and other\nnations remain uncertain and could adversely\nimpact economic and market conditions for the\nCompany and its clients and counterparties.\nThe war in Ukraine presents destabilizing\nforces, including higher and more volatile\ncommodity and food prices, which may cause\ninternational and domestic economic\ndeterioration. In addition, global demand for\nproducts may exceed supply during the economic\nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and such\nshortages may cause inflation, adversely\nimpact consumer and business confidence, and\nadversely affect the economy as well as the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results.\nFinancial markets may be adversely affected by\nthe current or anticipated impact of military\nconflict, including the war in Ukraine,\nterrorism, or other geopolitical events. This\ncould magnify inflationary pressure resulting\nfrom the pandemic and other sources and extend\nany prolonged period of higher inflation.\n\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely\naffect Truist\u2019s profitability and financial\ncondition.\n\nA transition away from the widespread use of\nLIBOR to alternative rates and other potential\ninterest rate benchmark reforms will continue\nover the course of the next year. The\npublication of the one-week and two-month U.S.\ndollar LIBOR settings ceased as of December\n31, 2021, while certain U.S. dollar LIBOR\ntenors are expected to continue to be\npublished until June 30, 2023.\n\nA group of market participants convened by the\nFRB, the ARRC, has selected SOFR as its\nrecommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nTruist offers SOFR-based lending solutions to\nwholesale and consumer clients and enters into\nSOFR-based derivative contracts. The passage\nof the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by\nCongress, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nimplementing rule, should decrease the risk of\ncontracts that are not remediated prior to the\ncessation deadline by providing the terms for\na transition to SOFR. Truist is also\nsupporting \u201ccredit sensitive\u201d alternatives,\nsuch as Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield and\nother alternatives as they develop in the\nmarket.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 21\nSOFR or other alternative reference rates may\nperform differently than LIBOR in response to\nchanging market conditions. For example, SOFR\ncould experience greater decreases during\ntimes of economic stress, which could require\nthe Company to lend at lower rates at times\nwhen the Company\u2019s borrowing costs are\nincreasing.\n\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to\nalternative reference rates is complex and\ncould have a range of adverse effects on the\nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. In particular, any such\ntransition could:\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates received\nor paid on the revenue and expenses associated\nwith or the value of the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates received\nor paid on the revenue and expenses associated\nwith or the value of other securities or\nfinancial arrangements, given LIBOR\u2019s role in\ndetermining market interest rates globally;\n\n\u2022 prompt inquiries or other actions from\nregulators in respect of the Company\u2019s\npreparation and readiness for the replacement\nof LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\nand\n\n\u2022 result in disputes, litigation, or other\nactions with borrowers or counterparties about\nthe interpretation and enforceability of\ncertain fallback language in LIBOR-based\ncontracts and securities.\n\nThe transition away from LIBOR to alternative\nreference rates has required the transition to\nor development of appropriate systems, models,\nand analytics to effectively transition the\nCompany\u2019s risk management and other processes\nfrom LIBOR-based products to those based on\nthe applicable alternative reference rate,\nsuch as SOFR. Truist has developed a LIBOR\ntransition team and project plan to address\nthe transition. Truist has largely completed\nits assessment of risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR and continues its\nremediation efforts. There can be no guarantee\nthat these efforts will successfully mitigate\nthe operational risks associated with the\ntransition away from LIBOR to an alternative\nreference rate.\n\nThe manner and impact of the transition from\nLIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as\nwell as the effect of these developments on\nthe Company\u2019s funding costs, loan, investment\nsecurities, and derivative portfolios, as well\nas ALM, is uncertain.\n                                              \n  Credit Risks                                \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to credit risk by\nlending, committing to lend money, or entering\ninto a letter of credit or other types of\ncontracts with counterparties.\n\nTruist incurs credit risk, which is the risk\nof loss if the Company\u2019s borrowers or\ncounterparties fail to perform according to\nthe terms of their contracts. A number of\nproducts expose the Company to credit risk,\nincluding loans and leases, lending\ncommitments, derivatives, trading assets, and\ninvestment securities. Changes in credit\nquality can have a significant impact on the\nCompany\u2019s earnings and capital position. The\nCompany estimates and establishes contractual\nlifetime reserves for credit risks and credit\nlosses inherent in its determination of credit\nexposure. This process, which is critical to\nthe Company\u2019s financial results and condition,\nrequires complex calculations and extensive\nuse of judgment, considering both external and\nborrower-specific factors that might impair\nthe ability of borrowers to repay their loans.\nAs is the case with any such assessments,\nthere is always the chance that the Company\nwill fail to identify all pertinent factors or\nthat the Company will fail to accurately\nestimate the impacts of factors identified.\n\nCredit losses may exceed the amount of the\nCompany\u2019s reserves due to changing economic\nconditions, falling real estate prices,\nfalling commodity prices, higher unemployment,\nor other factors such as changes in borrower\nbehavior. There is no assurance that reserves\nwill be sufficient to cover all credit losses.\nIn the event of significant deterioration in\ncurrent or projected future economic\nconditions, the Company may be required to\nincrease reserves in future periods, which\nwould reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and\npotentially impact its capital.\n\nThe Company may have more credit risk and\nhigher credit losses to the extent that loans\nare concentrated by loan type, industry\nsegment, borrower type, or location of the\nborrower or collateral.\n\nThe Company\u2019s credit risk and credit losses\ncan increase if the Company\u2019s loans are\nconcentrated in borrowers engaged in the same\nor similar activities or in borrowers who as a\ngroup may be uniquely or disproportionately\naffected by economic, market conditions, or\nclimate change.\n\nDeterioration in economic conditions, housing\nconditions, or real estate values, including\nas a result of climate change or natural\ndisasters, in the markets in which the Company\noperates could result in materially higher\ncredit losses. The Company is also subject to\nphysical risks of climate change, which could\nmanifest in the form of asset quality\ndeterioration and could be exacerbated by\nspecific portfolio concentrations, and\ntransition risks of climate change, which\ncould manifest through longer-term shifts in\nmarket dynamics and consumer preferences and\ncould be exacerbated in specific industries\nthat may be more sensitive or vulnerable to a\ntransition to a low carbon economy.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market\nconditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or\nilliquidity, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be\nfurther increased when it fails to realize the\nexpected value of the collateral it holds;\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are\nnot sufficient to recover the full amount owed\nto Truist; or counterparties are unable to\npost collateral, whether for operational or\nother reasons. Furthermore, disputes with\ncounterparties concerning the valuation of\ncollateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility or\nilliquidity, and Truist could suffer losses\nduring these periods if it is unable to\nrealize the expected value of collateral or to\nmanage declines in the value of collateral.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risks                             \n                                              \nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix\ncould increase Truist\u2019s funding costs.\n\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of\nfunding. Truist competes with banks and other\nfinancial institutions for deposits and as a\nresult, the Company could lose deposits in the\nfuture, clients may shift their deposits into\nhigher cost products, or the Company may need\nto raise interest rates to avoid deposit\nattrition. Funding costs may also increase if\ndeposits lost are replaced with wholesale\nfunding. Higher funding costs reduce Truist\u2019s\nnet interest margin, net interest income, and\nnet income. In recent months, the environment\nfor maintaining and growing deposits has\nbecome more challenging as the FRB reduces the\nsize of its balance sheet through quantitative\ntightening and continues to increase interest\nrates giving clients an incentive to move\ndeposits to money market funds and other\nhigher-yielding alternatives, which could lead\nto an increase in the reliance on higher cost\nwholesale funding.\n\nTruist\u2019s liquidity could be impaired by an\ninability to access short-term funding, an\nunforeseen outflow of cash, or the inability\nto monetize liquid assets.\n\nLiquidity is essential to Truist\u2019s businesses.\nWhen volatility or disruptions occur in the\nwholesale funding markets, the Company\u2019s\nability to access short-term liquidity could\nbe materially impaired. In addition,\nidiosyncratic factors, as well as other\nfactors outside of the Company\u2019s control, such\nas a general market disruption or an\noperational problem that affects third\nparties, could impair the Company\u2019s ability to\naccess short-term funding or create an\nunforeseen outflow of cash due to, among other\nfactors, draws on unfunded commitments or\ndeposit attrition. The Company\u2019s inability to\nmonetize liquid assets or to access short-term\nfunding or capital markets could constrain the\nCompany\u2019s ability to make new loans or meet\nexisting lending commitments and could\nultimately jeopardize the Company\u2019s overall\nliquidity and capitalization.\n\nTruist relies on the mortgage secondary market\nand GSEs for some of the Company\u2019s liquidity.\n\nTruist sells a portion of the mortgage loans\nthat it originates to reduce the Company\u2019s\nretained credit risk and to provide funding\ncapacity for originating additional loans.\nGSEs could limit their purchases of conforming\nloans due to capital constraints or other\nchanges in their criteria for conforming loans\n(e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower\neligibility). This potential reduction in\npurchases could limit the Company\u2019s ability to\nfund new loans.\n\nProposals have been presented to reform the\nhousing finance market in the U.S., including\nthe role of the GSEs in the housing finance\nmarket. The extent and timing of any such\nregulatory reform of the housing finance\nmarket and the GSEs, as well as any effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business and financial results,\nare uncertain.\n\nAny reduction in the Company\u2019s credit ratings\ncould increase the Company\u2019s cost of funding\nor reduce its access to the capital markets.\n\nCredit ratings are influenced by many factors,\nincluding the Company\u2019s profitability, asset\nquality, capital levels, liquidity, business\nmix, operations, and risk management\npractices. Credit ratings may also be\ninfluenced by other factors, some of which are\noutside the Company\u2019s control, such as recent\nand anticipated economic trends, geopolitical\nrisk, legislative and regulatory developments,\nincluding implied levels of government support\nduring a crisis, environmental, social, and\ngovernance considerations, and litigation, as\nwell as changes to the rating agencies\u2019\nmethodologies, among others. Truist\u2019s failure\nto maintain credit ratings could adversely\naffect funding costs and increase the\nCompany\u2019s cost of capital. A downgrade to\nTruist\u2019s credit ratings might also adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct\nderivatives business with certain clients and\ncounterparties and could trigger obligations\nto make cash or collateral payments to certain\nclients and counterparties. Additionally, a\nratings downgrade could affect the Company\u2019s\nability to attract or retain funding,\nincluding deposits from commercial and\ncorporate clients.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 23\nThe Parent Company could have less access to\nfunding sources and its liquidity could be\nconstrained if the Bank becomes unable to pay\ndividends during a time of stress.\n\nThe Parent Company relies upon capital markets\naccess and dividends from affiliates for\nfunding and has less access to contingent\nfunding sources than the Bank. If the Bank\nwere subject to a financial stress, its\ndividends to the Parent Company could be\nreduced or eliminated in order to support Bank\ncapital ratios or other regulatory\nrequirements. This would increase the Parent\nCompany\u2019s reliance on capital markets at a\ntime when spreads and funding costs are likely\nelevated due the stress impacting the Bank.\n\nTruist may be impacted by the soundness of\nother financial institutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine\nfunding transactions could be adversely\naffected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are\ninterrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. Truist\nhas exposure to many different industries and\ncounterparties and routinely executes\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial industry, including brokers and\ndealers, central counterparties, commercial\nbanks, investment banks, mutual and hedge\nfunds and other institutional investors and\nclients. As a result, defaults by, or even\nrumors or questions about, one or more\nfinancial services institutions or the\nfinancial services industry generally, in the\npast have led to market-wide liquidity\nproblems and could lead to losses or defaults\nby Truist or by other institutions. Many of\nthese transactions expose the Company to\ncredit risk in the event of default of the\nCompany\u2019s counterparty or client. In addition,\nthe Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated\nwhen the collateral held by Truist cannot be\nliquidated or is liquidated at prices not\nsufficient to recover the full amount of the\nCompany\u2019s exposure. Any such losses could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n                                              \n  Technology Risks                            \n                                              \nThe Company faces cybersecurity risks,\nincluding denial of service, phishing, malware\nand ransomware attacks, potential insider\nthreats, and third-party cybersecurity\nincidents, which could result in the\ndisclosure of confidential information,\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s operations,\ncause reputational damage, and create\nsignificant legal and financial exposure.\n\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network\ninfrastructure and those of third parties are\ntargeted in cyberattacks, such as denial of\nservice attacks, hacking, malware or\nransomware intrusion, data corruption\nattempts, terrorist activities, or identity\ntheft. The Company\u2019s business relies on the\nsecure processing, transmission, storage, and\nretrieval of confidential, proprietary, and\nother information in the Company\u2019s information\nsystems and that of third parties. In\naddition, to access the Company\u2019s network,\nproducts, and services, the Company\u2019s clients\nand other third parties may use personal\nmobile devices or computing devices that are\noutside of the Company\u2019s network environment\nand can introduce added cybersecurity risks.\n\nTruist and Truist\u2019s clients, regulators and\nother third parties, including other financial\nservices institutions and companies engaged in\ndata processing, have been subject to and are\nlikely to continue to be the target of\ncyberattacks and similar incidents.\nCyberattacks may expose security\nvulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or\nthe systems of third parties or other security\nmeasures that could result in the unauthorized\ngathering, monitoring, misuse, release, loss,\nor destruction of confidential, proprietary,\nor sensitive information. A cyberattack could\nalso damage the Company\u2019s systems by\nintroducing material disruptions to the\nCompany\u2019s or the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or other\nthird parties\u2019 network access or business\noperations. As cyber threats continue to\nevolve, the Company may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to continue\nto modify or enhance the Company\u2019s protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate any\ninformation security vulnerabilities or\nincidents. Despite efforts to ensure the\nintegrity of the Company\u2019s systems and\nimplement controls, processes, policies and\nother protective measures, the Company may not\nbe able to anticipate all security breaches,\nnor may the Company be able to implement\nsufficient preventive measures against such\nsecurity breaches, which may result in\nmaterial losses or consequences to Truist.\n\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions\nhave significantly increased in recent years\nin part because of the proliferation of new\ntechnologies to facilitate and conduct\nfinancial transactions. For example,\ncybersecurity risks may increase in the future\nas Truist continues to evolve its internal and\nexternal digital offerings and capabilities.\nIn addition, cybersecurity risks have\nsignificantly increased in recent years in\npart due to the increased sophistication and\nactivities of organized crime affiliates,\nterrorist organizations, hostile foreign\ngovernments, disgruntled teammates or vendors,\nactivists and other external parties,\nincluding those involved in corporate\nespionage. Even the most advanced internal\ncontrol environment may be vulnerable to\ncompromise. Persistent attackers may succeed\nin penetrating defenses given enough\nresources, time, and motive. The techniques\nused by cyber criminals change frequently and\nmay not be recognized until launched or well\nafter a breach has occurred. In addition, the\nexistence of cyberattacks or security breaches\nat third-party vendors with access to the\nCompany\u2019s data may not be disclosed to the\nCompany in a timely manner.\n\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company also faces indirect technology,\ncybersecurity and other operational risks\nrelating to clients and other third parties\nthat the Company relies upon to facilitate or\nenable business activities, including,\nfinancial counterparties, regulators, and\nproviders of critical infrastructure such as\ninternet access and electrical power. As a\nresult of increasing consolidation,\ninterdependence, and complexity of financial\nentities and technology systems, a technology\nfailure, cyberattack or other information or\nsecurity breach that significantly degrades,\ndeletes, or compromises the systems or data of\none or more financial entities could have a\nmaterial impact on counterparties or other\nmarket participants. This consolidation,\ninterconnectivity, and complexity increases\nthe risk of operational failure, on both\nindividual and industry-wide bases, as\ndisparate systems need to be integrated, often\non an accelerated basis. Any third-party\ntechnology failure, cyberattack, other\ninformation or security breach, termination,\nor constraint could, among other things,\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to\nconduct transactions, service the Company\u2019s\nclients, manage the Company\u2019s exposure to risk\nor expand the Company\u2019s business.\n\nA successful penetration or circumvention of\nsystem security could cause serious negative\nconsequences, including loss of clients and\nbusiness opportunities; costs associated with\nmaintaining business relationships after an\nattack or breach; significant disruption to\nthe Company\u2019s operations and business;\nmisappropriation, exposure or destruction of\nthe Company\u2019s confidential information,\nintellectual property, funds and those of the\nCompany\u2019s clients; damage to the Company\u2019s or\nthe Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or third parties\u2019\ncomputers or systems; or a violation of\napplicable privacy laws and other laws. This\ncould result in litigation exposure,\nregulatory fines, penalties, loss of\nconfidence in the Company\u2019s security measures,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensatory costs, and additional compliance\ncosts, which could adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations, liquidity,\nand financial condition. In addition, the\nCompany may not have adequate insurance\ncoverage to compensate for losses from a\ncybersecurity event.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operational capabilities managed\nor supplied by third parties could fail, be\ncompromised, or be breached, which could\ndisrupt the Company\u2019s business and adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s results of operations,\nand financial condition, as well as cause\nlegal exposure or reputational harm.\n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure\nexists throughout the Company\u2019s business and,\nas a result of the Company\u2019s interactions with\nand reliance on third parties, is not limited\nto the Company\u2019s own internal operational\nfunctions. The Company\u2019s operational and\nsecurity systems and infrastructure, including\ncomputer systems, data management and internal\nprocesses, as well as those of third parties,\nare integral to the Company\u2019s performance.\nTruist relies on numerous third-party service\nproviders to conduct aspects of its business\noperations and faces operational risks\nrelating to them. Third-party cybersecurity\nincidents, such as system breakdowns or\nfailures, misconduct by the employees of such\nparties, or cyberattacks, including\nransomware, and supply-chain compromises,\ncould affect their ability to deliver a\nproduct or service to the Company or result in\nlost or compromised information of the Company\nor its clients. Truist cannot be certain that\nwe will receive timely notification of such\ncyberattacks or other security breaches. Like\nother large enterprises, Truist experiences\nmalicious cyber activity directed at our\nvendors and other service providers. There is\nno guarantee that the measures the Company\ntakes will provide absolute security or\nrecoverability given that the techniques used\nin cyberattacks are complex and frequently\nchange and are difficult to anticipate. Truist\nteammates and third parties may expose the\nCompany to risk as a result of human error,\nmisconduct, malfeasance, or a failure or\nbreach of systems and infrastructure. For\nexample, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct\nbusiness may be adversely affected by any\nsignificant disruptions, including to third\nparties with whom the Company interacts or\nrelies upon.\n\nTruist will continually encounter\ntechnological change and must effectively\nanticipate, develop, and implement new\ntechnology.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing\nrapid technological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services. Truist has invested in\ntechnology to automate functions previously\nperformed manually, to facilitate the ability\nof clients to engage in financial transactions\nand otherwise to enhance the client experience\nwith respect to the Company\u2019s products and\nservices. Truist expects to make additional\ninvestments in innovation and technology to\naddress technological disruption in the\nindustry and improve client offerings and\nservice. These changes allow the Company to\nbetter serve the Company\u2019s clients and to\nreduce costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in\npart, upon the Company\u2019s ability to address\nclients\u2019 needs by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that satisfy client\ndemands, including demands for faster and more\nsecure payment services, to create\nefficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations and\nto integrate those offerings with legacy\nplatforms or to update those legacy platforms.\nA failure to maintain or enhance the Company\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because of a failure to\nanticipate client expectations, a failure in\nthe performance of technological developments\nor an untimely roll out of developments, may\ncause the Company to lose market share or\nincur additional expense.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\nThe Company faces risks associated with\nquality, availability, and retention of key\ndata for operational, strategic, regulatory,\nand compliance purposes.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial and regulatory\nreporting and key business decisions are\nreliant on the quality, availability, and\nretention of data. While Truist has\nimplemented a robust data management control\nframework to mitigate the risks associated\nwith data while at rest, in motion, and in\nuse, a control failure may lead to data loss,\ndata misuse, and data quality risks. These\nfailures may ultimately result in inaccuracies\nin financial and regulatory reports, inhibited\nmanagement decision-making, financial loss,\nreputational risk, and regulatory compliance\nrisk, including privacy compliance risks to\nthe extent that the Company has ineffective or\nflawed consumer data management processes and\nmonitoring.\n                                              \n  Other External Risks                        \n                                              \nThe effects of COVID-19 adversely impacted the\nCompany\u2019s operations and financial performance\nand similar adverse impacts resulting from\npandemics could occur in future periods.\n\nAlthough the global economy has begun to\nrecover from the COVID-19 pandemic, as many\nhealth and safety restrictions have been\nlifted and vaccine distribution has increased,\ncertain adverse consequences of the pandemic,\nincluding labor shortages, disruptions of\nglobal supply chains and inflationary\npressures, continue to impact the\nmacroeconomic environment and could adversely\naffect our business.\n\nIn addition, a significant portion of the\nCompany\u2019s workforce continues to work remotely\nat least on a part-time basis, which may\nincrease cybersecurity risks to the Company.\nCommercial clients have experienced varying\nlevels of disruptions on their supply chains\nor decreases in demand for their products and\nservices. Consumer clients have experienced\ninterrupted income or unemployment. Certain\nindustries have been particularly susceptible\nto the effects of the pandemic, including\nindustries where Truist has outstanding loans\nto clients.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic initially resulted\nin an increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses, a reduction of fee income, a reduction\nof net interest margin, a decrease in demand\nfor certain types of loans, and an increase in\nexpenses. A resurgence of pandemic conditions\ncould reintroduce these impacts and also\naffect the Company\u2019s capital and liquidity\nposition, impair the ability of borrowers to\nrepay outstanding loans, impair the value of\ncollateral securing loans, cause an outflow of\ndeposits, influence the recognition of credit\nlosses on loans and securities and increase\nthe allowance for credit losses, result in\nadditional lost revenue, cause additional\nincreases in expenses, result in goodwill\nimpairment charges, result in the impairment\nof other financial and nonfinancial assets,\nand increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital.\n\nPhysical, transition, or other risks\nassociated with climate change have the\npotential to negatively impact operations,\nbusiness results, and clients.\n\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks\nof climate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters. Climate change\npresents (i) physical risks from the direct\nimpacts of changing climate patterns and acute\nweather events, such as damage to physical\nassets and service disruptions, and (ii)\ntransition risks from changes in regulations,\ndisruptive technologies, and shifting market\ndynamics towards a lower carbon economy. The\nphysical risks of climate change include\ndiscrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes,\ntornadoes, and wildfires, and longer-term\nshifts in climate patterns, such as extreme\nheat, sea level rise, and more frequent and\nprolonged drought. Physical risks may alter\nthe Company\u2019s strategic direction in order to\nmitigate certain financial risks. Such events\ncould also disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or\nthose of its clients or third parties the\nCompany relies on, not only through direct\ndamage to assets, but also from indirect\nimpacts due to supply chain disruption and\nmarket volatility.\n\nTransition risks, including changes in\nconsumer preferences, additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes and additional\ncounterparty or client requirements, could\nhave a material adverse impact on asset values\nand the financial performance of Truist\u2019s\nbusinesses, and those of its clients. Climate\nchange could also present incremental risks to\nthe execution of the Company\u2019s long-term\nstrategy. While material impact from climate\nchange is expected to occur over a longer time\nhorizon, the acceleration of a transition to a\nlow-carbon economy could present idiosyncratic\nrisks for individual companies. Additionally,\ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy will\nentail extensive policy, legal, technology,\nand market initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces potential\nreputational risks as a result of its\npractices related to climate change, including\nas a result of the Company\u2019s direct or\nindirect involvement in certain industries, as\nwell as any decisions management makes in\nresponse to managing climate risk, especially\nas views on climate-related matters become\nsubject to increased polarization. As climate\nrisk is interconnected with all key risk\ntypes, Truist continues to embed climate risk\nconsiderations into risk management\nstrategies. Due to the level of uncertainty\naround the future path of climate change, the\nCompany\u2019s risk management strategies may not\nbe effective in fully mitigating climate risk\nexposures.\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses\nfrom fraud.\n\nFraud attacks across the banking sector have\nsignificantly increased in recent years. Bad\nactors have industrialized the execution of\nfraud attacks with ever increasing\nsophistication and speed. Bad actors\nincreasingly use sophisticated applications\nand techniques to perpetrate the fraud. In\nsome cases, these individuals are associated\nwith large criminal organizations that share\ntactics and strategies. Fraud schemes are wide\nranging, including: counterfeit and forged\nchecks; debit and credit card fraud; social\nengineering; ATM attacks through the use of\nskimmers to obtain client data; and phishing\nto obtain client account credentials. These\nschemes make use of a variety of products and\nservices to steal funds, such as real-time\npayments, ACH and wire transfers. Bad actors\nperpetuate fraudulent activity by\nimpersonating real clients with stolen\nidentities and account credentials, use other\nindividuals, known as mules, to interact with\nTruist, or create new identities, referred to\nas synthetic identities. In some instances,\nthe fraud is committed by existing clients.\n\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents, which may increase in frequency and\nintensity due to climate change, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\noperations or the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results.\n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic weather events\nor pandemics could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition or results of\noperations. Truist has significant operations\nand clients along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts\nas well as other regions of the U.S., which\ncould be adversely impacted by hurricanes,\ntornadoes and other severe weather in those\nareas. Truist and its clients could also be\ndisrupted by the physical effects of climate\nchange, which may become more frequent and\nsevere. Natural and other types of disasters,\nincluding as a result of climate change, could\nhave an adverse impact on Truist\u2019s businesses\nin that such events could materially disrupt\nthe Company\u2019s operations or the ability or\nwillingness of the Company\u2019s clients to access\nthe financial services offered by Truist,\nincluding adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s\nborrowers to timely repay their loans and the\nvalue of any collateral held. These events\ncould reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and cause\nvolatility in the Company\u2019s financial results\nfor any fiscal quarter or year and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough Truist has business continuity plans\nand other safeguards in place, the Company\u2019s\noperations and communications may be adversely\naffected by natural disasters or other\ncatastrophic events, and there can be no\nassurance that such business continuity plans\nwill be effective.\n\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities\nbetween countries or within a country or\nregion could have a material adverse effect on\nthe U.S. economy and on Truist\u2019s businesses.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or\ngroups, including armed conflict or\nintensified cyberattacks, could expand in\nunpredictable ways by drawing in other\ncountries or escalating into full-scale war\nwith potentially catastrophic consequences,\nparticularly if one or more of the combatants\npossess nuclear weapons. Depending on the\nscope of the conflict, the hostilities could\nresult in worldwide economic disruption,\nheightened volatility in financial markets,\nsevere declines in asset values, disruption of\nglobal trade and supply chains, and diminished\nconsumer, business and investor confidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have\nsignificant negative effects on the U.S.\neconomy, and, as a result, Truist\u2019s operations\nand earnings. Truist could also experience\nmore numerous and aggressive cyberattacks\nlaunched by or under the sponsorship of one or\nmore of the adversaries in such a conflict.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risks                            \n                                              \nTruist is subject to extensive and evolving\ngovernment regulation and supervision, which\ncould increase the cost of doing business,\nlimit Truist\u2019s ability to make investments and\ngenerate revenue, and lead to costly\nenforcement actions.\n\nThe banking and financial services industries\nare highly regulated. Truist is subject to\nsupervision, regulation, and examination by\nregulators, including the FRB, FDIC, NCCOB,\nSEC, CFTC, CFPB, FINRA, NFA, and various other\nfederal and state regulatory agencies. The\nstatutory and regulatory framework governing\nTruist is generally intended to protect\ndepositors, the DIF, clients, and the U.S.\nfinancial system as a whole, and not Truist\u2019s\ndebt holders or shareholders. Truist is also\nsubject to heightened requirements under the\nenhanced prudential standards and expects\nincreased supervisory scrutiny, including, for\nexample, single counterparty credit limits,\nheightened expectations with respect to\ngovernance, risk management and internal\ncontrols and additional capital and liquidity\nrequirements. Reform of the financial services\nindustry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act,\nincluding the EGRRCPA and other legislative,\nregulatory, and technological changes, affect\nthe Company\u2019s operations.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\nThese laws and regulations and Truist\u2019s\ninability to act in certain instances without\nreceiving prior regulatory approval affect\nTruist\u2019s lending practices, capital structure,\ninvestment practices, dividend policy, ability\nto repurchase common stock and ability to\npursue strategic acquisitions, among other\nactivities. Changes to statutes, regulations\nor regulatory policies or their interpretation\nor implementation and the continued\nheightening of regulatory requirements could\naffect Truist in substantial and unpredictable\nways. Federal and state banking regulators\nalso possess broad powers to take supervisory\nactions as they deem appropriate. These\nsupervisory actions may result in higher\ncapital requirements, higher deposit insurance\npremiums, higher compliance expenses, and\nlimitations on the Company\u2019s activities that\ncould have a material adverse effect on\noperations or profitability.\n\nIn recent years, both Congress and the federal\nbanking regulators have engaged in a\nrebalancing of the post financial crisis legal\nand regulatory framework, particularly by\ntailoring enhanced prudential standards to the\nsize, risk profile, and complexity of the\nbanking organization. Under the current\npresidential administration and Congress, the\nCompany and other large financial institutions\nare becoming subject to increased scrutiny,\nmore intense supervision and regulation, and a\nhigher risk of enforcement action, with\nincreased fines and penalties which we expect\nto continue. Truist expects that its\nbusinesses will remain subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision. Any potential new\nregulations or modifications to existing\nregulations would likely necessitate changes\nto Truist\u2019s existing regulatory compliance and\nrisk management infrastructure. Compliance\nwith new regulations and supervisory\ninitiatives may increase costs. In addition,\nconcerns over climate change may prompt\nchanges in regulations that, in turn, could\nhave a material adverse impact on asset values\nand the financial performance of Truist\u2019s\nbusinesses and its clients.\n\nFinancial regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad power\nand discretion to direct Truist\u2019s actions, and\nthey have assumed an active oversight,\nexamination, and enforcement role across the\nfinancial services industry on both the\nfederal and state levels. Areas of focus in\nthe recent past have been with respect to\nmortgage-related practices, student lending\npractices, auto lending practices, complaints\nmanagement, sales practices and related\nincentive compensation programs, consumer\nprivacy, fair banking, overdraft and other\nfees, retention and recordkeeping of\nelectronic communications, and other consumer\ncompliance matters. Truist continues to be\nsubject to examinations and ongoing monitoring\nto assess compliance with BSA/AML laws and\nregulations, as well as sanctions compliance\nadministered by the OFAC. Additionally, actual\nor alleged misconduct by teammates, including\nunethical, fraudulent, improper, or illegal\nconduct, or unfair, deceptive, abusive, or\ndiscriminatory practices, can result in\nlitigation, or government investigations and\nenforcement actions, and cause significant\nreputational harm, even if ultimately\nunsubstantiated.\n\nTruist also relies upon third parties who may\nexpose the Company to compliance and legal\nrisk. New or existing legal requirements also\ncould heighten the reputational impact of\nperceived misuses of customer data by the\nCompany and third parties. See additional\ndisclosures in the \u201cRegulatory Considerations\u201d\nsection.\n\nTruist could become subject to future\nlegislation and regulatory requirements beyond\nthose currently proposed, adopted, or\ncontemplated, including policies and\nrulemaking related to the Dodd-Frank Act,\nlimits on acquisitions, and more stringent\ncapital and liquidity requirements. The\ncumulative effect of such legislation and\nregulations on Truist\u2019s\u2019 business, operations,\nand profitability cannot be accurately\npredicted. Such regulatory changes may reduce\nTruist\u2019s revenues, limit the types of\nfinancial services and products it may offer,\nalter the investments it makes, affect the\nmanner in which it operates its businesses,\nincrease its litigation and regulatory costs\nshould it fail to appropriately comply with\nnew or modified laws and regulatory\nrequirements and increase the ability of non-\nbanks to offer competing financial services\nand products.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, operations, and ability to pay\ndividends, or otherwise return capital to\nshareholders.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements established by the FRB\nand the FDIC. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the BCBS and then\napplied, with adjustments, in each country by\nthe appropriate domestic regulatory bodies.\nDomestic regulatory agencies have the ability\nto apply stricter capital and liquidity\nstandards than those developed by the BCBS. In\nseveral instances, the U.S. banking agencies\nhave done so with respect to U.S. banking\norganizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of the\nCompany\u2019s capital and liquidity may prevent\nthe Company from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force the Company to take\nactions contrary to their interests. For\nexample, Truist may be limited in its ability\nto pay or increase dividends or otherwise\nreturn capital to shareholders. In addition,\nthese requirements may impact the amount and\ntype of loans the Company is able to make.\nTruist may be constrained in its ability to\nexpand, either organically or through mergers\nand acquisitions. These requirements may cause\nthe Company to sell or refrain from acquiring\nassets where the capital requirements appear\ninconsistent with the assets\u2019 underlying\nrisks. In addition, liquidity standards\nrequire the Company to maintain holdings of\nhighly liquid investments, thereby reducing\nthe Company\u2019s ability to invest in less liquid\nassets, even if more desirable from a balance\nsheet return or interest rate risk management\nperspective. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to additional\ncapital and liquidity requirements.\n\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe liquidity standards applicable to large\nU.S. banking organizations have been\nsupplemented in recent years. The NSFR rule,\nwhich is designed to ensure that banking\norganizations maintain a stable funding\nprofile in relation to their asset composition\nand off-balance sheet activities, became\neffective on July 1, 2021. Public disclosure\nof the NSFR will begin in 2023.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements applicable to Truist\nand Truist Bank, the Company\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to capital\nrequirements established by the SEC.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nreceive periodic review and revision by the\nBCBS and the U.S. banking agencies. Changes to\ncapital and liquidity requirements may require\nTruist or Truist Bank to maintain more or\nhigher quality capital or greater liquidity\nand could increase some of the potential\nadverse effects described above.\n\nTruist is subject to certain risks related to\noriginating and selling mortgages and may be\nrequired to repurchase mortgage loans or\nindemnify mortgage loan purchasers.\n\nTruist is required to make customary\nrepresentations and warranties to the\npurchaser about the mortgage loans and the\nmanner in which they were originated when\nselling mortgage loans or loan\nsecuritizations. An increase in the number of\nrepurchase and indemnity demands from\npurchasers related to representations and\nwarranties on loans sold could result in an\nincrease in the amount of losses for loan\nrepurchases. Truist also bears a risk of loss\nfrom borrower defaults for multi-family\ncommercial mortgage loans sold to FNMA.\n\nIn addition to repurchase claims from GSEs,\nTruist could be subject to indemnification\nclaims from non-GSE purchasers of the\nCompany\u2019s loans. Claims could be made if the\nloans sold fail to conform to statements about\ntheir quality, the manner in which the loans\nwere originated and underwritten or their\ncompliance with state and federal law.\n\nTruist faces risks as a servicer of loans.\n\nThe Company acts as servicer and master\nservicer for mortgage loans included in\nsecuritizations and for unsecuritized mortgage\nloans owned by investors. As a servicer or\nmaster servicer for those loans, the Company\nhas certain contractual obligations to the\nsecuritization trusts, investors, or other\nthird parties. As a servicer, Truist\u2019s\nobligations include foreclosing on defaulted\nmortgage loans or, to the extent consistent\nwith the applicable securitization or other\ninvestor agreement, considering alternatives\nto foreclosure such as loan modifications or\nshort sales. In the Company\u2019s capacity as a\nmaster servicer, obligations include\noverseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by\nthe servicer. Generally, the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations are set by contract, for\nwhich the Company receives a contractual fee.\nHowever, GSEs can amend their servicing\nguidelines unilaterally, which can increase\nthe scope or costs of the services required\nwithout any corresponding increase in the\nCompany\u2019s servicing fee. Further, the CFPB has\nimplemented national servicing standards,\nwhich have increased the scope and cost of\nservices that the Company is required to\nperform. In addition, there has been a\nsignificant increase in state laws that impose\nadditional servicing requirements that\nincrease the scope and cost of the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations. As a servicer, the\nCompany also advances expenses on behalf of\ninvestors, which it may be unable to collect.\n\nA material breach of the Company\u2019s obligations\nas servicer or master servicer may result in\ncontract termination if the breach is not\ncured within a specified period of time\nfollowing notice, which can generally be given\nby the securitization trustee or a specified\npercentage of security holders, causing the\nCompany to lose servicing income. In addition,\nthe Company may be required to indemnify the\nsecuritization trustee against losses from any\nfailure by the Company, as a servicer or\nmaster servicer, to perform the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations or any act or omission\non the Company\u2019s part that involves willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence.\nFor certain investors and certain\ntransactions, Truist may be contractually\nobligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or\nreimburse the investor for credit losses\nincurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing\nerrors with respect to the loan. The Company\nmay be subject to increased repurchase\nobligations as a result of claims made that\nthe Company did not satisfy its obligations as\na servicer or master servicer. The Company may\nalso experience increased loss severity on\nrepurchases, which may require a material\nincrease to the Company\u2019s repurchase reserve.\n\nThe Company has and may continue to receive\nindemnification requests related to the\nCompany\u2019s servicing of loans owned or insured\nby other parties, primarily GSEs. Typically,\nsuch a claim seeks to impose a compensatory\nfee on the Company for departures from GSE\nservice levels. In most cases, this is related\nto delays in the foreclosure process.\nAdditionally, the Company has received\nindemnification requests where an investor or\ninsurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of\nthe servicing agreement. While the number of\nsuch claims has been small, these could\nincrease in the future.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 29\nTruist faces substantial legal and operational\nrisks in safeguarding personal information.\n\nTruist\u2019s businesses are subject to complex and\nevolving laws and regulations governing the\nprivacy and protection of personal information\nof individuals. Individuals whose personal\ninformation may be protected by law can\ninclude the Company\u2019s clients (and in some\ncases its clients\u2019 clients), prospective\nclients, job applicants, teammates, and the\nemployees of the Company\u2019s vendors, and third\nparties. Complying with the laws, rules and\nregulations applicable to the Company\u2019s\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing and\nstorage of personal information can increase\noperating costs, impact the development of new\nproducts or services, and reduce operational\nefficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of\npersonal information by the Company or a\nthird-party affiliated with the Company could\nexpose the Company to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions.\n\nAdditional risks could arise from the failure\nof the Company or third parties to provide\nadequate disclosure or transparency to the\nCompany\u2019s clients about the personal\ninformation collected from them and the use of\nsuch information; to receive, document, and\nhonor the privacy preferences expressed by the\nCompany\u2019s clients; to protect personal\ninformation from unauthorized disclosure; or\nto maintain proper training on privacy\npractices for all teammates or third parties\nwho have access to personal information.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of\nTruist\u2019s measures to safeguard personal\ninformation, or even the perception that those\nmeasures are inadequate, could cause Truist to\nlose existing or potential clients, and\nthereby reduce Truist\u2019s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by the\nCompany to comply with applicable privacy or\ndata protection laws, rules and regulations\nmay subject it to inquiries, examinations and\ninvestigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant\nliabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions. Any of these could damage\nTruist\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely\naffect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents\ninvolving the inappropriate collection, use,\nsharing or storage of personal information\nhave led to expanded governmental scrutiny of\npractices relating to the safeguarding of\npersonal information by companies. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and\ncould in the future lead to, the adoption of\nstricter laws, rules and regulations relating\nto the collection, use, sharing and storage of\npersonal information. Truist will likely be\nsubject to new and evolving data privacy laws\nin the U.S. and abroad, which could result in\nadditional costs of compliance, litigation,\nregulatory fines, and enforcement actions.\nThese types of laws, rules and regulations\ncould prohibit or significantly restrict\nfinancial services firms such as Truist from\nsharing information among affiliates or with\nthird parties such as vendors, and thereby\nincrease compliance costs, or could restrict\nTruist\u2019s use of personal data when developing\nor offering products or services to clients.\nThese restrictions could also inhibit Truist\u2019s\ndevelopment or marketing of certain products\nor services or increase the costs of offering\nthem to clients.\n\nDifferences in regulation can affect the\nCompany\u2019s ability to compete effectively.\n\nThe content and application of laws and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as\nthe size of the firm, the jurisdiction in\nwhich it is organized or operates, and other\ncriteria. Large institutions, such as the\nCompany, often are subject to more stringent\nregulatory requirements and supervision than\nsmaller institutions. In addition, financial\ntechnology companies and other non-traditional\ncompetitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation or may be supervised by a national\nor state regulatory agency that does not have\nthe same regulatory priorities or supervisory\nrequirements as the Company\u2019s regulators.\nThese differences in regulation can impair the\nCompany\u2019s ability to compete effectively with\ncompetitors that are less regulated and do not\nhave similar compliance costs.\n\nThe Company can face risks of non-compliance\nand incur higher operational and compliance\ncosts under laws and regulations relating to\nanti-money laundering, economic sanctions,\nembargo programs, and anti-corruption.\n\nTruist must comply with laws and regulations\nrelating to anti-money laundering, economic\nsanctions, embargo programs and anti-\ncorruption, which can increase its risks of\nnon-compliance and costs associated with the\nimplementation and maintenance of complex\ncompliance programs. A violation of any of\nthese legal and regulatory requirements could\nsubject Truist or individual employees to\nregulatory enforcement actions as well as\nsignificant civil and criminal penalties.\n\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Strategic Risks                             \n                                              \nTruist may face the risk of financial loss or\nnegative impact resulting from ineffective\nstrategy setting and execution, adverse\nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness\nto changes in the external environment.\n\nEmbedded within strategic risks are risks\nassociated with:\n\n\u2022 maintaining a level of earnings appropriate\nto support growth objectives and the ability\nto maintain dividends in various economic\ncycles,\n\n\u2022 successful delivery of innovation and\ntechnology strategies that transform the\nclient experience as well as the way Truist\nconducts business,\n\n\u2022 changes and events within the external\nenvironment, including geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive,\nand regulatory factors, and\n\n\u2022 implementation and execution of climate risk\nmanagement related programs.\n\nAny of the foregoing may impact the successful\nexecution of Truist\u2019s strategy.\n\nCompetition may reduce Truist\u2019s client base or\ncause Truist to modify pricing for products\nand services.\n\nTruist operates in a highly competitive\nindustry that could become even more\ncompetitive with growth in areas such as neo-\nbanks, fintechs, and other non-bank platforms.\nIncreased competition could arise from\ntechnological advancements, legislative and\nregulatory changes, as well as competition\nfrom other financial services companies, some\nof which may be subject to less extensive\nregulation than Truist. The Company\u2019s success\ndepends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to\nadapt its offering of products and services to\nevolving industry standards and client\nexpectations. The widespread adoption of new\ntechnologies has required and will continue to\nrequire substantial investments to modify\nexisting products and services or to develop\nnew products and services. In addition, there\nis increasing pressure to provide products and\nservices at lower prices further reducing\ncontribution margins. The Company may not be\nsuccessful in introducing new products and\nservices in response to industry trends or\ndevelopments in technology or those new\nproducts may not achieve market acceptance.\n\nTruist also competes with nonbank companies\ninside and outside of the Company\u2019s market\narea and, in some cases, with companies other\nthan those traditionally considered financial\nsector participants. In particular, technology\ncompanies are increasingly focusing on the\nfinancial sector, either in partnership with\ncompetitor banking organizations or on their\nown. These companies generally are not subject\nto the same regulatory oversight as main\nstreet financial institutions and may\naccordingly realize certain cost strategies\nand offer products and services at more\nfavorable rates and with greater convenience\nto the client. This competition could result\nin the loss of clients and revenue in areas\nwhere fintechs are operating. As the pace of\ntechnology and change advance, continuous\ninnovation is expected to exert long-term\npressure on the financial services industry.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies by\ncompetitors, including internet banking\nservices, mobile applications, advanced ATM\nfunctionality and cryptocurrencies could\nrequire the Company to make substantial\ninvestments to modify or adapt the Company\u2019s\nexisting products and services or even\nradically alter the way Truist conducts\nbusiness. These and other capital investments\nin the Company\u2019s business may not produce\nexpected growth in earnings anticipated at the\ntime of the expenditure.\n\nTruist may not be able to complete future\nmergers or acquisitions.\n\nThe Company must generally satisfy a number of\nmeaningful conditions before completing an\nacquisition of another bank or BHC, including\nfederal and state regulatory approvals. In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nor BHC acquisition, bank regulators will\nconsider, among other factors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on competition; financial\ncondition and future prospects, including\ncurrent and projected capital ratios and\nlevels; the competence, experience and\nintegrity of management; record of compliance\nwith laws and regulations; the convenience and\nneeds of the communities to be served,\nincluding the acquiring institution\u2019s record\nof compliance under the CRA; the effectiveness\nof the acquiring institution in combating\nmoney laundering activities; and public\ncomments from various stakeholders. In\naddition, U.S. regulators must take systemic\nrisk to the U.S. financial system into account\nwhen evaluating whether to approve a potential\nacquisition transaction involving a large\nfinancial institution like Truist. There is no\ncertainty as to when or if or on what terms\nand conditions, any required regulatory\napprovals will be granted for any potential\nacquisition. In specific cases, Truist may be\nrequired to sell banks or branches or take\nother actions as a condition to receiving\nregulatory approval. An inability to satisfy\nother conditions necessary to consummate an\nacquisition transaction, such as third-party\nlitigation, a judicial order blocking the\ntransaction or lack of shareholder approval,\ncould also prevent the Company from completing\nan announced acquisition. There has been\nincreased scrutiny of bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions from regulators and\ngovernment entities in recent years. Refer to\nthe \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section within Item 1\n\u201cBusiness\u201d for additional discussion.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nTruist has businesses other than banking that\nare subject to a variety of risks.\n\nTruist is a diversified financial services\ncompany. This diversity subjects the Company\u2019s\nearnings to a broader variety of risks and\nuncertainties. Other businesses in addition to\nbanking that the Company operates include\ninsurance brokerage, investment banking,\nsecurities underwriting and market making,\nloan syndications, investment management and\nadvice and retail and wholesale brokerage\nservices offered through the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries. These businesses entail\nsignificant market, operational, credit,\ncompliance, technology, legal and other risks\nthat could materially adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations.\n                                              \n  Regulatory and Legal Risks                  \n                                              \nThe Company may incur fines, penalties and\nother negative consequences from regulatory\nviolations, including inadvertent or\nunintentional violations.\n\nTruist maintains systems and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that it complies with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can\nbe no assurance that these will be effective.\nIn addition to fines and penalties, the\nCompany may suffer other negative consequences\nfrom regulatory violations including\nrestrictions on certain activities, such as\nthe Company\u2019s mortgage business, which may\naffect the Company\u2019s relationship with the\nGSEs and may also damage the Company\u2019s\nreputation and this in turn might materially\naffect the Company\u2019s business and results of\noperations.\n\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal banking regulators and law\nenforcement agencies. This enforcement\nauthority includes, among other things, the\nability to assess significant civil or\ncriminal monetary penalties, fines, or\nrestitution; to issue cease and desist or\nremoval orders; and to initiate injunctive\nactions against banking organizations and\ninstitution-affiliated parties. These\nenforcement actions may be initiated for\nviolations of laws and regulations and unsafe\nor unsound practices. Any future enforcement\naction could have a material adverse impact.\nIn addition, governmental authorities have, at\ntimes, sought criminal penalties against\ncompanies in the financial services sector for\nviolations, and, at times, have required an\nadmission of wrongdoing from financial\ninstitutions in connection with resolving such\nmatters. Criminal convictions or admissions of\nwrongdoing in a settlement with the government\ncan lead to greater exposure in civil\nlitigation, reputational harm, and other\nsignificant collateral consequences such as\nrestrictions on engaging in new activities or\nacquisitions.\n\nA failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements and expectations could expose the\nCompany to fines, regulatory penalties, other\ncosts, reputational damage, civil litigation,\nand regulatory or enforcement actions which\nmay, in turn, result in limitations on\nengaging in new activities or expanding\ngeographically and lead to higher operational\nand compliance costs. In some cases,\ngovernmental authorities have required\ncriminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as\npart of settlements, which could have\nsignificant consequences for a financial\ninstitution, including loss of clients,\nrestrictions on the ability to access the\ncapital markets and the inability to operate\ncertain businesses or offer certain products\nfor a period of time. Violations of laws and\nregulations or deemed deficiencies in risk\nmanagement practices also may be incorporated\ninto Truist\u2019s confidential supervisory\nratings. A downgrade in these ratings, or\nthese or other regulatory actions and\nsettlements, could limit Truist\u2019s ability to\nconduct expansionary activities for a period\nof time and require new or additional\nregulatory approvals before Truist can engage\nin certain other business activities.\n\nFurther, some legal frameworks provide for the\nimposition of fines or penalties for\nnoncompliance even when the noncompliance was\ninadvertent or unintentional and even when\nthere were controls in place designed to\nensure compliance. For example, Truist is\nsubject to orders and regulations issued by\nOFAC that prohibit financial institutions from\nengaging with prohibited parties, including\ncertain foreign governments, legal entities\nand individuals. OFAC has the authority to\nimpose penalties for any violation of the\nprohibitions, whether the violation is\nintentional or unintentional, even if there\nwere appropriate controls and Truist acted in\ngood faith.\n\nLegal proceedings may adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s results, reputation, and business\noperations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the\nCompany is subject to lawsuits, claims, and\nformal and informal enforcement activity,\nincluding regulatory investigations. The\nvolume of legal proceedings against\nparticipants in the financial services\nindustry, including the Company, is\nsubstantial, and enforcement actions by\nregulatory authorities are becoming more\ncommon in the current regulatory environment.\nLegal proceedings against financial services\nfirms may increase depending on factors such\nas market downturn, changes in law and\nincreased regulatory scrutiny.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny or the results\nof an investigation or examination may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. There is no assurance\nthat those actions will not result in\nregulatory settlements or other enforcement\nactions against Truist. Furthermore, a single\nevent involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings by\nmultiple federal and state agencies and\nofficials. In addition, if one or more\nfinancial institutions are found to have\nviolated a law or regulation relating to\ncertain business activities, this could lead\nto investigations by regulators or other\ngovernmental agencies of the same or similar\nactivities by other financial institutions,\nincluding Truist, and large fines and remedial\nmeasures that may have been imposed in\nresolving earlier investigations for the same\nor similar activities at other financial\ninstitutions may be used as the basis for\nfuture settlements.\n\nClaims and legal actions, including class\naction lawsuits and enforcement proceedings,\ncould involve large monetary amounts,\nsignificant defense costs, and result in\nsettlements, judgments, penalties, fines,\ninjunctions, or other forms of relief that are\nadverse to the Company. Responding to\ninquiries, investigations, lawsuits, and other\nproceedings is time-consuming and expensive\nand can divert senior management attention\nfrom Truist\u2019s business.\n\nThe outcome of any such legal proceedings, as\nwell as the timing of any ultimate\nresolutions, may be difficult to predict or\nestimate. Actual legal and other costs arising\nfrom claims and legal actions may be greater\nthan the Company\u2019s legal accruals. Further,\nthe Company may not have accruals for all\nlegal proceedings where we face a risk of loss\nwhere the loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe ultimate resolution of a pending legal\nproceeding or significant regulatory or\ngovernment action against the Company could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition\nor cause significant reputational harm, which\nmay adversely impact the Company\u2019s business\nprospects. Further, the Company may be exposed\nto substantial uninsured liabilities, which\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s results\nof operations and financial condition.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risks                          \n                                              \nNegative public opinion could damage the\nCompany\u2019s reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues.\n\nTruist\u2019s earnings and capital are subject to\nrisks associated with negative public opinion.\nNegative public opinion could result from the\nCompany\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any\nnumber of activities, including lending, sales\nand other operating practices, corporate\ngovernance, acquisitions, a breach of client\nor teammate information, the failure of any\nproduct or service sold to meet clients\u2019\nexpectations or applicable regulatory\nrequirements. In addition, the public\nperception that a cyber-attack on the\nCompany\u2019s systems has been successful, whether\nor not this perception is correct, may damage\nthe Company\u2019s reputation with clients and\nthird parties with whom the Company does\nbusiness. The compromise of personal\ninformation, in particular, could result in\nidentify theft and cause serious reputational\nharm. Any cybersecurity breaches, attacks and\nother similar incidents could significantly\nharm Truist\u2019s reputation, which could\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operation.\n\nNegative public opinion could also result from\nincreased polarization of environmental and\nsocial considerations that may affect Truist\nand clients of Truist. Negative public opinion\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability\nto attract and retain clients and teammates\nand can result in litigation and regulatory\nactions. Actual or alleged conduct by one of\nthe Company\u2019s businesses can result in\nnegative public opinion about the Company\u2019s\nother businesses. Actual or alleged conduct by\nanother financial services company can result\nin negative public opinion about the financial\nservices industry in general and, as a result,\nadversely affect Truist.\n\nScrutiny of the Company\u2019s sales, training, and\nincentive compensation practices could damage\nthe Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues.\n\nThe Company may face increased scrutiny of its\nsales and other business practices, training\npractices, incentive compensation design and\ngovernance, and quality assurance and client\ncomplaint resolution practices. There can be\nno assurance that the Company\u2019s processes and\nactions will meet regulatory standards or\nexpectations. Findings from self-identified or\nregulatory reviews may require responsive\nactions, including increased investments in\ncompliance systems and teammates or the\npayment of fines, penalties, increased\nregulatory assessments or client redress and\nmay increase legal or reputational risk\nexposures.\n                                              \n  Talent Management Risks                     \n                                              \nTruist depends on the expertise of key\nteammates. If these individuals leave or\nchange their roles without effective\nreplacements, operations may suffer.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, to a large\ndegree, on the continued services of executive\nofficers and other key teammates who have\nextensive experience in the industry. The\nCompany\u2019s business could be adversely impacted\nfrom the loss of key persons or failure to\nmanage a smooth transition to new teammates.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 33\nThe Company depends on the ability to attract\nand retain qualified teammates while\neffectively managing recruiting and\ncompensation costs amid highly competitive and\nrapidly changing market conditions in order to\nimplement and execute upon business\nstrategies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the ability\nto attract and retain high performing, diverse\nand well-qualified teammates. The Company\nfaces significant competition in the\nrecruitment of highly motivated teammates who\ncan deliver Truist\u2019s purpose, mission, and\nvalues, which has recently intensified as a\nresult of changes in the labor market caused\nby COVID-19, broader economic factors and\nevolving expectations of the workforce.\nChanges in employee preferences for work\nenvironments, in particular the desire of\nteammates to work remotely for many or all of\ntheir hours, may impact our ability to attract\nand retain qualified teammates in those areas\nof our operations that require a concentration\nof onsite personnel (e.g., call centers). The\nCompany\u2019s ability to execute its business\nstrategy and provide high quality service may\nsuffer if the Company is unable to recruit or\nretain a sufficient number of qualified\nteammates or if the costs of employee\ncompensation or benefits increase\nsubstantially. The U.S. banking agencies have\njointly issued comprehensive guidance designed\nto ensure that incentive compensation policies\ndo not undermine the safety and soundness of\nbanking organizations by encouraging teammates\nto take imprudent risks. This guidance\nsignificantly affects the amount, form, and\ncontext of incentive compensation that may be\nprovided to teammates and could negatively\naffect Truist\u2019s ability to compete for talent\nrelative to non-banking companies. The SEC\nfinalized its incentive compensation clawback\nrule which may result in additional costs and\nrestrictions on the form of the Company\u2019s\nincentive compensation.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on its ability,\nand the ability of key external parties, to\nmaintain appropriately staffed workforces, and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health and\nsafety of employees.\n\nTruist\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products\nand services that meet the expectations of its\nclients, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on\nits ability to staff its operations\nappropriately and on the competence,\nintegrity, health and safety of its teammates.\nTruist is similarly dependent on the\nworkforces of other parties on which its\noperations rely, including vendors and other\nservice providers. Truist\u2019s businesses could\nbe materially and adversely affected by the\nineffective implementation of business\ndecisions; any failure to institute controls\nthat appropriately address risks associated\nwith business activities; or to appropriately\ntrain teammates with respect to those risks\nand controls; or staffing shortages,\nparticularly in tight labor markets. Changes\nin law or regulation in jurisdictions in which\nour operations are located that affect\nemployees may also adversely affect our\nability to hire and retain qualified teammates\nin those jurisdictions. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s business could be adversely impacted\nby a significant operational breakdown or\nfailure, theft, fraud or other unlawful\nconduct, or other negative outcomes caused by\nhuman error or misconduct by a teammate of\nTruist or an employee of another party on\nwhich Truist\u2019s operations depend. Truist\u2019s\noperations could also be impaired if the\nmeasures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to help ensure the health and\nsafety of its teammates are ineffective, or if\nany external party on which Truist relies\nfails to take appropriate and effective\nactions to protect the health and safety of\nits employees.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in Truist\u2019s business, which may\nimpact decisions made by Management and\nregulators.\n\nTruist relies on models to measure risks,\nestimate certain financial values, and inform\ncertain business decisions. Models may be used\nin such processes as determining the pricing\nof various products, grading loans and\nextending credit, measuring interest rate and\nother market risks, predicting or estimating\nlosses, assessing capital adequacy and\ncalculating economic and regulatory capital\nlevels, as well as estimating the value of\nfinancial instruments and balance sheet items.\n\nPoorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly\nused models present the risk that certain\nTruist business decisions may be adversely\naffected by inappropriate model output. Also,\ninformation Truist provides to the public or\nto its regulators based on poorly designed,\nimplemented, or incorrectly used models could\nbe inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions\nthat the regulators make, including those\nrelated to capital distributions to Truist\u2019s\nshareholders, could be adversely affected due\nto the perception of insufficient model\nquality or incorrect model use.\n\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and\nprocesses are critical to how the Company\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations and require management to make\nestimates about matters that are uncertain.\n\nAccounting policies and processes are\nfundamental to how the Company records and\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require the\nuse of estimates and assumptions that may\naffect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or\nliabilities and financial results. Several of\nthe Company\u2019s accounting policies are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective, and complex judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain\nand because it is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported under\ndifferent conditions or using different\nassumptions. If assumptions or estimates\nunderlying the Company\u2019s financial statements\nare incorrect or are adjusted periodically,\nthe Company may experience material losses.\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nManagement has identified certain accounting\npolicies as being critical because they\nrequire management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the\nvaluations of assets, liabilities,\ncommitments, and contingencies. A variety of\nfactors could affect the realization of income\nand expense or the recognition of assets and\nliabilities in the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements. Truist has established detailed\npolicies and procedures that are intended to\nensure these critical accounting estimates and\njudgments are well controlled and applied\nconsistently. In addition, the policies and\nprocedures are intended to ensure that the\nprocess for changing methodologies occurs in\nan appropriate manner. Due to the uncertainty\nsurrounding the Company\u2019s judgments and the\nestimates pertaining to these matters, the\nCompany cannot guarantee that adjustments to\naccounting policies or restatement of prior\nperiod financial statements will not be\nrequired.\n\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC\nchange the financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that govern the preparation of the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements. In addition,\naccounting standard setters and those who\ninterpret the accounting standards may change\nor even reverse their previous interpretations\nor positions on how these standards should be\napplied. Changes in financial accounting and\nreporting standards and changes in current\ninterpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol, can be hard to predict and could\nmaterially affect how the Company reports its\nfinancial results and condition. In some\ncases, the Company could be required to apply\na new or revised standard retroactively,\nresulting in the restatement of prior period\nfinancial statements.\n\nDepressed market values for the Company\u2019s\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company\u2019s goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is periodically tested for impairment\nby comparing the fair value of each reporting\nunit to its carrying amount. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. The fair value of a reporting unit\nis impacted by the reporting unit\u2019s expected\nfinancial performance and susceptibility to\nadverse economic, regulatory, and legislative\nchanges. Future adverse changes in economic\nconditions or expected financial performance\nmay cause the fair value of a reporting unit\nto be below its carrying amount, resulting in\ngoodwill impairment. The estimated fair values\nof the individual reporting units are assessed\nfor reasonableness by reviewing a variety of\nindicators, including comparing these\nestimated fair values to the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime. While this comparison provides some\nrelative market information about the\nestimated fair value of the reporting units,\nit is not determinative and needs to be\nevaluated in the context of the current\neconomic environment. However, significant and\nsustained declines in the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization could be an indication of\npotential goodwill impairment. Refer to the\n\u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d section for\nadditional details related to the Company\u2019s\nintangible assets policy.\n                                              \n  Operational Risks                           \n                                              \nTruist relies on other companies to provide\nkey components of the Company\u2019s business\ninfrastructure.\n\nThird parties provide key components of the\nCompany\u2019s business infrastructure, such as\nbanking services, data processing, business\nprocesses, internet connections, and network\naccess. Any disruption in such services\nprovided by these third parties or any failure\nof these third parties to handle current or\nhigher volumes of use could adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and\nservices to clients, to support teammates and\notherwise to conduct business. Technological\nor financial difficulties of a third-party\nservice provider could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business to the extent those\ndifficulties result in the interruption or\ndiscontinuation of services provided by that\nparty. Further, in some instances, the Company\nmay be responsible for failures of such third\nparties to comply with government regulations.\nThe Company is not insured against all types\nof losses as a result of third-party failures,\nand the insurance coverage that does exist may\nbe inadequate to protect the Company from all\nlosses resulting from system failures or other\ndisruptions. Failures in the Company\u2019s\nbusiness infrastructure could interrupt its\noperations or increase the costs of doing\nbusiness.\n\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may\nnot be effective.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks\nto mitigate risk and loss. Truist has\nestablished policies, processes, and\nprocedures intended to identify, measure,\nmonitor, report, and analyze the types of risk\nto which the Company is subject, including\nliquidity, credit, market, operational,\ntechnology, reputational, strategic, and\ncompliance risk, among others. However, the\nCompany\u2019s risk management measures may not be\nfully effective in identifying and mitigating\nthe Company\u2019s risk exposure in all market\nenvironments or against all types of risk,\nincluding risks that are unidentified or\nunanticipated, even if the frameworks for\nassessing risk are properly designed and\nimplemented. Some of the Company\u2019s methods of\nmanaging risk are based upon the Company\u2019s use\nof observed historical market behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. These methods may not\naccurately predict future exposures, which\ncould be significantly greater than historical\nmeasures indicate. If the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework proves ineffective, it\ncould suffer unexpected losses and could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\nTruist depends on the accuracy and\ncompleteness of information about clients and\ncounterparties.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist relies on the\ncompleteness and accuracy of representations\nmade by and information furnished by or on\nbehalf of clients and counterparties,\nincluding financial statements and other\nfinancial information. If the information\nprovided is not accurate or complete, the\nCompany\u2019s decisions about extending credit or\nentering into other transactions with clients\nor counterparties could be adversely affected\nand the Company could suffer defaults, credit\nlosses or other negative consequences as a\nresult.\n\nTruist can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks\nassociated with the introduction of or changes\nto products, services, and delivery platforms.\n\nWhen Truist launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services\n(including mobile connectivity, electronic\ntrading and cloud computing), acquires or\ninvests in a business or makes changes to an\nexisting product, service or delivery\nplatform, it may not fully appreciate or\nidentify new operational risks that may arise\nfrom those changes, or may fail to implement\nadequate controls to mitigate the risks\nassociated with those changes. Any significant\nfailure in this regard could diminish Truist\u2019s\nability to operate one or more of its\nbusinesses or result in potential liability to\nclients and counterparties, and result in\nincreased operating expenses. The Company\ncould also experience higher litigation costs,\nincluding regulatory fines, penalties and\nother sanctions, reputational damage,\nimpairment of Truist\u2019s liquidity, regulatory\nintervention, or weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could\nmaterially and adversely affect Truist\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of operations.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for\nthe oversight of vendors and other service\nproviders can result in higher costs and other\npotential exposures.\n\nThe Company must comply with enhanced\nregulatory and other standards associated with\ndoing business with vendors and other service\nproviders, including standards relating to the\noutsourcing of functions as well as the\nperformance of significant banking and other\nfunctions by subsidiaries. Truist incurs\nsignificant costs and expenses in connection\nwith its initiatives to address the risks\nassociated with oversight of its internal and\nexternal service providers. Truist\u2019s failure\nto appropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those involving\nsignificant banking functions, shared services\nor other critical activities, could materially\nadversely affect Truist. Specifically, any\nsuch failure could result in: potential harm\nto clients, and any liability associated with\nthat harm; regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions; lower revenues, and the\nopportunity cost from lost revenues; increased\noperational costs, or harm to Truist\u2019s\nreputation.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

Truist\u2019s ability to\ngenerate liquid assets for distribution is\ndependent on the ability of Truist Bank to pay\ndividends to the Parent Company. The payment\nof cash dividends is an integral part of\nproviding a competitive return on\nshareholders\u2019 investments and needs to be\nbalanced with maintaining sufficient capital\nto support future growth and meet regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nManagement\u2019s target common dividend payout\nratio (computed by dividing common stock\ndividends by net income available to common\nshareholders) is between 30% and 50% during\nnormal economic conditions.

Net interest income on a TE\nbasis was $14.5 billion, an increase of $1.3\nbillion primarily due to higher market\ninterest rates coupled with strong loan growth\nand well controlled deposit costs. These\nincreases were partially offset by lower\npurchase accounting accretion and lower PPP\nrevenue. Average earning assets increased\n$22.3 billion, or 4.9%, compared to the\nearlier year. The increase in average earning\nassets reflects a $13.4 billion, or 4.6%,\nincrease in average outstanding loans and a\n$7.8 billion, or 5.6%, increase in average\nsecurities. Average deposits increased $19.7\nbillion, or 4.9%, and average short-term\nborrowings increased $8.8 billion, or 142%,\npartially offset by a decrease in average\nlong-term debt of $3.2 billion, or 8.7%,\ncompared to the earlier year. Noninterest\nincome for 2022 decreased $571 million\ncompared to 2021 primarily due to lower\ninvestment banking and mortgage banking\nincome, partially offset by growth in\ninsurance revenues.\n\nNIM was 3.01% for 2022, up 15 basis points\ncompared to the prior year primarily due to\nhigher market interest rates and well\ncontrolled deposit costs. The growth in NIM\nwas negatively impacted by lower purchase\naccounting accretion, which benefited NIM by\n13 basis points in 2022 compared to 26 basis\npoints in 2021.

The average cost of\ntotal deposits was 0.27%, up 23 basis points.\nThe average cost of long-term debt was 2.31%,\nup 78 basis points. The increases in rates on\nassets and liabilities reflects the rising\nrate environment during 2022.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $777\nmillion, compared to a benefit of $813 million\nfor the prior year. The current year reflects\nstrong loan growth and a moderate decline in\nthe ALLL ratio, whereas the prior year\nincluded reserve releases due to the improving\neconomic environment during that period. Net\ncharge-offs were $823 million, compared to\n$697 million for the prior year. The net\ncharge-off ratio for the current year of 0.27%\nwas up three basis points compared to the\nearlier year primarily driven by normalizing\ntrends across certain consumer portfolios,\npartially offset by lower charge offs in the\ncommercial and industrial portfolio.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $527 million, or\n3.5%, compared to the prior year. Excluding\nthe aforementioned items and the impact of\namortization expense for intangibles,\nnoninterest expense increased $380 million, or\n3.0%, driven by higher professional fees,\noperational losses, expenses related to\nacquired companies and marketing expenses,\npartially offset by lower occupancy and\nequipment expenses.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.4\nbillion for 2022, compared to $1.6 billion to\n2021. The effective tax rate for 2022 was\n18.3%, compared to 19.5% for the prior year.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate was\nprimarily driven by higher favorable permanent\ntax items and an increase in discrete tax\nbenefits.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 41\nTruist\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2022\nwere $555.3 billion, an increase of $14.0\nbillion, or 2.6%, compared to December 31,\n2021. Total loans and leases at December 31,\n2022, were $327.4 billion, an increase of\n$33.1 billion, or 11% compared with December\n31, 2021. The increase in loans reflects\nstrong production during the year across most\nindustry verticals and product groups in the\ncommercial and industrial portfolio, as well\nas growth in the majority of the consumer\nportfolios. Truist\u2019s total investment\nsecurities portfolio declined $25.1 billion,\nor 16%, as paydowns and maturities were\nreinvested in the loan portfolio and the fair\nvalue of the AFS portfolio declined due to the\nrising rate environment. In the first quarter\nof 2022, Truist transferred $59.4 billion of\nAFS securities to HTM as the Company continues\nto execute upon its asset-liability management\nstrategies.\n\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2022 were\n$494.7 billion, an increase of $22.7 billion,\nor 4.8%, from the prior year, reflecting an\nincrease of $18.1 billion in short-term\nborrowings and an increase of $7.3 billion, or\n20%, in long-term debt, partially offset by a\ndecrease of $3.0 billion, or 0.7%, in\ndeposits.\n\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity was $60.5 billion\nat December 31, 2022, a decrease of $8.7\nbillion from December 31, 2021.

Truist\u2019s\nbook value per common share at December 31,\n2022 was $40.58, compared to $47.14 at\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nAsset quality ratios were relatively stable at\nDecember 31, 2022 compared to the prior year,\nreflecting Truist\u2019s prudent risk culture and\nportfolio diversification. Nonperforming loans\nand leases held for investment were 0.36% of\nloans and leases held for investment at\nDecember 31, 2022, down two basis points\ncompared to December 31, 2021. The ALLL ratio\nwas 1.34% compared to 1.53% for prior year.\nThe ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs was\n5.32X for 2022, compared to 6.36X in 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the CET1 ratio was\n9.0% and the average LCR was 112%. The 60\nbasis point decline in the CET1 ratio compared\nto December 31, 2021 primarily reflects strong\nloan growth, acquisitions, and the impact from\nthe phase-in of the CECL transition relief.\n\nOn February 16, 2023, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell a 20% stake of the common\nequity in Truist Insurance Holdings, a\nsubsidiary of Truist and the sixth-largest\ninsurance brokerage in the U.S., for $1.95\nbillion to an investor group led by Stone\nPoint Capital, LLC. The closing of the\ninvestment is expected to occur in the second\nquarter of 2023, subject to customary closing\nconditions and regulatory approvals. The\ntransaction allows Truist to maintain\nstrategic flexibility and future upside in\nTruist Insurance Holdings, which will continue\nto benefit from Truist\u2019s operations, access to\ncapital, and client relationships. Truist will\nalso preserve and enhance its client service\napproach to offering leading insurance\nproducts to its banking clients. Moreover,\nTruist Insurance Holdings gains an experienced\npartner in Stone Point, which brings deep\nindustry expertise and access to capital to\nhelp accelerate Truist Insurance Holdings\u2019\ngrowth. Upon closing of the transaction, a\nfive-person Board will be formed to oversee\nTruist Insurance Holdings, comprising four\nmembers appointed by Truist and one member\nappointed by Stone Point.\n                                              \n  Key Areas of Focus                          \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s business is dynamic and complex.\nConsequently, management annually evaluates\nand, as necessary, adjusts the Company\u2019s\nbusiness strategy in the context of the\ncurrent operating environment.

Excluding\nthe aforementioned items, noninterest income\nwas down $537 million, or 5.8%, compared to\nthe prior year. Investment banking and trading\nincome decreased $446 million, or 31%, due to\nlower capital markets activity and lower\nmerger and acquisition fees.

Excluding the aforementioned\ngains, other income decreased $237 million, or\n46%, primarily due to valuation changes from\nassets held for certain post-retirement\nbenefits, which is primarily offset by lower\npersonnel expense, lower investment income and\nvaluation marks from the Company\u2019s SBIC and\nother strategic investments and lower\nderivative trading income. Wealth management\nincome decreased $54 million, or 3.9%,\nprimarily due to lower market valuations.\nInsurance income increased $416 million, or\n16%, due to acquisitions and continued organic\ngrowth.

The allocated provision\nfor credit losses increased $717 million\nprimarily due to a reserve release in the\nprior year as well as loan growth and a\nmoderately slower economic outlook in the\ncurrent year. Noninterest income decreased\n$274 million primarily due to a decrease in\nresidential mortgage income.

The allocated provision for\ncredit losses increased $786 million which\nreflects lower allowance releases in the\ncurrent year compared to the prior year,\npartially offset by lower net charge-offs in\nthe current year. Noninterest income decreased\n$513 million primarily due lower investment\nbanking revenue. Noninterest expense decreased\n$31 million primarily due to lower incentive\nexpense tied to lower revenues and lower\nprofessional fees as well as lower merger-\nrelated and restructuring charges, partially\noffset by investments in revenue producers.\n\nC&CB average loans and leases held for\ninvestment increased $11.0 billion, or 7.2%,\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 compared\nto the prior year. Excluding a $5.7 billion\ndecrease in average PPP loans, average loans\nheld for investment were up $16.6 billion, or\n11%, primarily driven by an increase in the\ncommercial and industrial portfolio loans,\npartially offset by a decrease in average\ncommercial real estate and commercial\nconstruction loans.\n\nC&CB average total deposits decreased $1.9\nbillion, or 1.3%, for the year ended December\n31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to a decrease in average interest bearing\ndeposits, partially offset by an increase in\nnoninterest bearing deposits.\n                                              \n  Insurance Holdings                          \n                                              \nIH net income was $546 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, an increase of $16\nmillion, or 3.0%, compared to the prior year.\nNoninterest income increased $441 million, or\n17%, primarily due to acquisitions and organic\ngrowth.

The allocated provision for\ncredit losses increased $80 million, which\nreflects a build in the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments in the current year compared to a\nrelease in the prior year. Noninterest income\ndecreased $225 million primarily due to\nvaluation changes from assets held for certain\npost-retirement benefits, which is primarily\noffset by lower personnel expense, and losses\non the sale of securities in the current year.\nNoninterest expense decreased $827 million\nprimarily due to lower personnel expense,\ncharitable contributions to the Truist\nFoundation and the Truist Charitable Fund in\nthe prior year, and lower merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and incremental\noperating expenses related to the Merger.\n                                              \n  Analysis of Financial Condition             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Investment Activities                       \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s Board-approved investment policy is\ncarried out by the MRLCC, which meets\nregularly to review the economic environment\nand establish investment strategies.

Management believes that this purpose\ncan best be accomplished by building strong\nclient relationships over time and developing\nin-depth local market knowledge. The Company\nemploys strict underwriting criteria governing\nthe degree of risk assumed and the diversity\nof the loan portfolio in terms of type,\nindustry, and geographical concentration.\n\nTruist lends to a diverse client base that is\ngeographically dispersed to mitigate\nconcentration risk arising from local and\nregional economic downturns. The following\ndiscussion provides additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolios. Refer\nto the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section for a\ndiscussion of the credit risk management\npolicies used to manage the portfolios.\n\nCommercial Loan and Lease Portfolio\n\nCommercial loans and leases represent the\nlargest category of the Company\u2019s loan and\nlease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking\ngenerally targets small-to-middle market\nbusinesses with annual sales between $2\nmillion and $500 million, while CIB provides\nlending solutions to large corporate clients.\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio\nconsists of lending to public and private\nbusiness clients and is composed of commercial\nand industrial, owner occupied, equipment\nleasing and financing, commercial real estate,\ngovernment and institutional financing, and\npremium financing\n\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s lending\npolicy, each commercial loan undergoes a\ndetailed underwriting process. Commercial\nloans are typically priced with an interest\nrate tied to market indices, such as the prime\nrate or SOFR and are individually monitored\nand reviewed for deterioration in the ability\nof the client to repay the loan. The majority\nof Truist\u2019s commercial loans are secured by\nreal estate, business equipment, inventories,\nand other types of collateral.\n\nResidential Mortgage Loan Portfolio\n\nTruist primarily originates conforming\nmortgage loans, loans under FHA, U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, or U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture programs, and higher\nquality jumbo and construction-to-permanent\nloans for 1-4 family residential properties.\nConforming loans are loans that are\nunderwritten in accordance with the\nunderwriting standards set forth by FNMA and\nFHLMC. They are generally collateralized by\none-to-four-family residential real estate,\ntypically have loan-to-collateral value ratios\nof 80% or less at origination, or have\nmortgage insurance as required by investors\nand are made to borrowers in good credit\nstanding.\n\nRisks associated with mortgage lending include\ninterest rate risk, which is mitigated through\nthe sale of a substantial portion of\nconforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary\nmortgage market and an effective MSR hedging\nprocess. Credit risk is managed through\nrigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage\ninsurance. The right to service the loans and\nreceive servicing income is generally retained\nwhen conforming loans are sold. Management\nbelieves that the retention of mortgage\nservicing diversifies income while enabling\nTruist to build long-term client relationships\nand offer high quality client service. Truist\nalso purchases residential mortgage loans from\ncorrespondent originators. The loans purchased\nfrom third-party originators are subject to\nsubstantially the same underwriting and risk-\nmanagement criteria as loans originated\ninternally.\n\nResidential Home Equity and Direct Loan\nPortfolio\n\nThe residential home equity and direct loan\nportfolio is composed of a wide variety of\nsecured and unsecured loans offered through\nTruist\u2019s branch network, as well as loans\noriginated by LightStream, Truist\u2019s national\nonline consumer lending division. Loans\noriginated through the Truist branch network\ninclude revolving home equity lines of credit\nsecured by first or second liens on\nresidential real estate and certain other\nsecured and unsecured lending marketed to\nqualifying clients and other creditworthy\ncandidates in Truist\u2019s market areas.\nLightStream provides fixed-rate, unsecured\nlending to consumers with strong credit\nthrough its proprietary online loan\norigination system.\n\nIndirect Auto Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect auto portfolio primarily includes\nsecured indirect installment loans to\nconsumers for the purchase of new and used\nautomobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also\nincludes nonprime and near prime automobile\nfinance. Such loans are originated through\napproved franchised and independent dealers\nthroughout the Truist market area and\nnationally through Regional Acceptance\nCorporation. These loans are relatively\nhomogeneous, and no single loan is\nindividually significant in terms of its size\nand potential risk of loss. Indirect auto\nloans are subject to rigorous lending policies\nand procedures and are underwritten with note\namounts and credit limits that are consistent\nwith the Company\u2019s risk philosophy. In\naddition to its normal underwriting due\ndiligence, Truist uses application systems and\nscoring systems to help underwrite and manage\nthe credit risk in its indirect auto\nportfolio.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\nIndirect Other Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect other portfolio includes secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used boats and\nrecreational vehicles. The indirect other\nportfolio also includes small ticket consumer\nlending related to the purchase of power\nsports and outdoor power equipment, and\ntrailers. These loans are relatively\nhomogeneous, and no single loan is\nindividually significant in terms of its size\nand potential risk of loss. These loans are\nsubject to similar rigorous lending policies\nand procedures as the indirect auto loan\nportfolio. The indirect other loan portfolio\nalso includes other indirect and point-of-sale\nlending to consumers to finance home\nimprovements, furniture purchases, certain\nelective health-care services, and other\nconsumer products segments. These loans are\noriginated in accordance with strict\nunderwriting criteria as determined by Truist.\n\nStudent Loan Portfolio\n\nThe student loan portfolio is primarily\ncomposed of government guaranteed student\nloans and additionally includes certain\nprivate student loans originated by third\nparties. The government guarantee mitigates\nsubstantially all of the risk related to\nprincipal and interest repayment for this\ncomponent of the portfolio. Private student\nloans were purchased from third-party\noriginators with credit enhancements that\npartially mitigate the Company\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\nCredit Card Loan Portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio consists of the\noutstanding balances on credit cards. Truist\nmarkets credit cards to its existing client\nbase and does not solicit cardholders through\nnationwide programs or other forms of mass\nmarketing. Such balances are generally\nunsecured and actively managed.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 5.

These increases were partially offset\nby a $1.9 billion decline in PPP loans.\n\nConsumer loans, including credit cards,\nincreased $11.3 billion during 2022 primarily\ndue to an $8.8 billion increase in residential\nmortgages due to correspondent channel\nproduction and lower prepayments, a $2.1\nbillion increase in indirect other primarily\ndue to growth from Service Finance,\nrecreational lending, and Sheffield\nportfolios, partially offset by runoff in\nother partnership lending programs, and a $1.5\nbillion increase in indirect auto primarily in\nthe prime auto segment. These increases were\npartially offset by $1.5 billion runoff in\nstudent loans.\n\nLHFS decreased $3.4 billion during 2022\nprimarily due to certain residential mortgage\ncorrespondent channel production being\nretained and lower overall mortgage volumes\ndue to rising rate environment, as well as a\ndecline in commercial loans.\n\n52 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the\nloans and leases by scheduled repayment period\nand interest rate terms.

At the\nscheduled maturity date (including balloon\npayment date), the client generally must\nrequest a new loan to replace the matured loan\nand execute either a new note or note\nmodification with rate, terms and conditions\nnegotiated at that time.\n                                              \n         1       1        5                   \n         \u2026       \u2026       to       \u2026           \n         \u2026       5       15       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       Y\u2026       \u2026       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       3       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       45       2       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2014       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       76       1       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       79  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       4       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         1       5       22       1       29  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       9\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n                                              \nCertain residential mortgage loans have an\ninitial period where the borrower is only\nrequired to pay the periodic interest.

In\naddition, indirect other increased $548\nmillion primarily due to growth from the\nService Finance, recreational lending, and\nSheffield portfolios, partially offset by\nrunoff in other partnership lending programs.\nThese increases were partially offset by $425\nmillion runoff in student loans.\n\n54 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Asset Quality                               \n                                              \nThe following tables summarize asset quality\ninformation:\n                                              \n  Table 19:                                   \n  Asset                                       \n  Quality                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  NPAs:                                       \n  NPLs:                                       \n  Commerci\u2026                                   \n  and          $         398    $        394  \n  industri\u2026                                   \n  CRE                     82              29  \n  Commerci\u2026                \u2014               7  \n  construc\u2026                                   \n  Resident\u2026              240             296  \n  mortgage                                    \n  Resident\u2026                                   \n  home                                        \n  equity                 173             141  \n  and                                         \n  direct                                      \n  Indirect               289             218  \n  auto                                        \n  Indirect                 6               5  \n  other                                       \n  Total                1,188           1,090  \n  NPLs HFI                                    \n  Loans                                       \n  held for                 \u2014              22  \n  sale                                        \n  Total                                       \n  nonaccru\u2026            1,188           1,112  \n  loans and                                   \n  leases                                      \n  Foreclos\u2026                                   \n  real                     4               8  \n  estate                                      \n  Other                                       \n  foreclos\u2026               58              43  \n  property                                    \n  Total                                       \n  nonperfo\u2026    $       1,250    $      1,163  \n  assets                                      \n  TDRs:                                       \n  Performi\u2026                                   \n  TDRs:                                       \n  Commerci\u2026                                   \n  and          $         136    $        147  \n  industri\u2026                                   \n  CRE                      5               5  \n  Commerci\u2026                1               \u2014  \n  construc\u2026                                   \n  Resident\u2026                                   \n  mortgage                                    \n  -

borrower. As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on a loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\nperforming TDR activity:\n                                              \n  Table 23:                                   \n  Rollforward of                              \n  Performing TDRs                             \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)                 2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance, January 1    $  1,390    $  1,361  \n  Inflows                  1,055         651  \n  Payments and              -283        -407  \n  payoffs (1)                                 \n  Charge-offs                -36         -44  \n  Transfers to                                \n  nonperforming TDRs         -48         -46  \n  (2)                                         \n  Removal due to the         -72         -12  \n  passage of time                             \n  Non-concessionary           -1         -15  \n  re-modifications                            \n  Transferred to                              \n  LHFS, sold and             -19         -98  \n  other                                       \n  Balance, December\u00a0    $  1,986    $  1,390  \n  31                                          \n                                              \n(1) Includes scheduled principal payments,\nprepayments, and payoffs of amounts\noutstanding.\n\n(2) Represent loans that no longer meet the\nrequirements necessary to reflect the loan in\naccruing status.\n\nThe following table provides further details\nregarding the payment status of TDRs\noutstanding:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n(1) Past due performing TDRs are included in\npast due disclosures and nonperforming TDRs\nare included in NPL disclosures.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nActivity related to the ACL is presented in\nthe following tables:\n                                              \n  Ta\u2026                                         \n  25:                                         \n  Ac\u2026                                         \n  in                                          \n  ACL    Year                                 \n  (D\u2026    End\u2026                                 \n  in     Dec\u2026                                 \n  mi\u2026    31,        20\u2026       2021       20\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ba\u2026                                         \n  be\u2026            $  4,\u2026    $  6,1\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n  of                                          \n  pe\u2026                                         \n  CE\u2026                                         \n  ad\u2026                                         \n  -

The ALLL ratio was 1.34%,\ncompared to 1.53% at December 31, 2021. The\ndecline in the ALLL ratio was due to strong\nportfolio performance and growth in higher\nquality loans, partially offset by a\nmoderately slower economic outlook.

When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\nframework that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk measurement\nand monitoring and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces\nand the Company\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nTruist\u2019s compensation plans are designed to\nconsider teammate\u2019s adherence to and\nsuccessful implementation of Truist\u2019s risk\nvalues and associated policies and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation structure supports\nits core values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist\u2019s purpose, mission, and values are the\nfoundation for the risk management framework\nutilized at Truist and therefore serve as the\nbasis on which the risk appetite and risk\nstrategy are built. Truist\u2019s RMO provides\nindependent oversight and guidance for risk-\ntaking across the enterprise. In keeping with\nthe belief that consistent values drive long-\nterm behaviors, Truist\u2019s RMO has established\nthe following risk values which guide\nteammates\u2019 day-to-day activities:\n\n\u2022 Managing risk is the responsibility of every\nteammate.\n\n\u2022 Proactively identifying risk and managing\nthe inherent risks of their businesses is the\nresponsibility of the business units.\n\n\u2022 Managing risk with a balanced approach which\nincludes quality, profitability, and growth.\n\n\u2022 Utilizing sound and consistent risk\nmanagement practices.\n\n\u2022 Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and\nqualitatively.\n\n\u2022 Realizing lower cost of capital from high\nquality risk management.\n\nTruist places significant emphasis on risk\nmanagement oversight and maintains a separate\nBoard-level Risk Committee, which assists the\nBoard in its oversight of the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement function. The Committee is\nresponsible for approving and periodically\nreviewing the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework and risk management policies as well\nas monitoring the Company\u2019s risk profile,\napproving risk appetite statements, and\nproviding input to management regarding\nTruist\u2019s risk appetite and risk profile.\n\nThe RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible\nfor overseeing the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring, management, and\nreporting of risk. The CRO has direct access\nto the Board to communicate any risk issues\n(current or emerging) as well as the\nperformance of the risk management activities\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\nAs illustrated below, the risk management\nframework is supported by three lines of\ndefense. The following figure describes the\nroles of the three lines of defense:\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist\u2019s Risk Governance framework is designed\nto provide comprehensive Board and Executive\nLeadership risk oversight, maintaining a\ncommittee governance structure that is\ndesigned to ensure alignment and execution of\nthe risk management framework. The committee\nstructure provides a mechanism to allow for\nefficient aggregation and escalation of risk\ninformation from the business units up to the\nrisk programs, Executive Leadership and\nultimately the Board.\n\nThe executive level committees include the\nERC, ECRC, MRLCC, EBPCC, TMC, and DC, each of\nwhich is chaired by a member of Executive\nLeadership. These committees provide oversight\nof each of the primary risk types.\n\nThe ERC establishes a fully integrated view of\nrisks across the company, provides broad\nstrategic oversight of all risk types, and\noversees corporate-wide strategies for\nidentifying, assessing, controlling,\nmeasuring, monitoring, and reporting risk at\nthe enterprise level. The ERC is responsible\nfor maintaining an effective risk management\nframework and monitoring its adoption and\nexecution across the enterprise. The ERC is\nchaired by the CRO, and its membership\nincludes all members of Executive Leadership\nand the Chief Audit Officer.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nPrincipal types of inherent risk include\nmarket, credit, liquidity, technology,\ncompliance, strategic, reputational, and\noperational risks. The following is a\ndiscussion of these risks.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist applies an\naverage deposit beta of approximately 50% to\nits non-maturity interest-bearing accounts\nwhen determining its interest rate\nsensitivity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 50 and 100 rate scenarios\nincorporate a floor of one basis point.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist has established parameters related to\ninterest rate sensitivity measures that\nprescribe a maximum negative impact on net\ninterest income under different interest rate\nscenarios that would result in an escalation\nto the Board. The following parameters and\ninterest rate scenarios are considered\nTruist\u2019s primary measures of interest rate\nrisk:\n\n\u2022 Maximum decrease in net interest income of\n7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 100\nbasis point gradual change in interest rates\nover four quarters; and a\n\n\u2022 Maximum decrease in net interest income of\n10% for the next 12 months assuming an\nimmediate 100 basis point parallel shock\nchange in interest rates. This interest rate\nshock analysis is designed to create an outer\nbound of acceptable interest rate risk.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry was very strong post-COVID-19, which\nresulted in growth in noninterest-bearing\ndemand deposits. However, with the significant\nincrease in rates in 2022, noninterest-bearing\ndeposits have begun to disintermediate to\ninterest-bearing accounts. Additional balance\nmovement above what is currently projected\nwould reduce the asset sensitivity of Truist\u2019s\nbalance sheet because the Company may increase\ninterest-bearing funds to offset the loss of\nthis advantageous funding source.\nAlternatively, the Company may reduce the size\nof its investment portfolio to offset the loss\nof noninterest-bearing demand deposits to\nlimit the impact on the balance sheet\u2019s asset\nsensitivity. The behavior of these deposits is\none of the most important assumptions used in\ndetermining the interest rate risk position of\nTruist. A decrease in the amount of these\ndeposits in the future would reduce the asset\nsensitivity of Truist\u2019s balance sheet because\nthe Company may increase interest-bearing\nfunds to offset the loss of this advantageous\nfunding source.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at\n100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  33:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resu\u2026                 \n  Grad\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assu\u2026                 \n  Chan\u2026        at           a                 \n  in       Decem\u2026       Decr\u2026                 \n  Rates       31,          in                 \n  (bps)      2022       Noni\u2026                 \n              (1)       Dema\u2026                 \n                        Depo\u2026                 \n              $20         $40                 \n           Billi\u2026       Bill\u2026                 \n  Up        -0.11  %    -0.77  %    -1.44  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      0.03       -0.45       -0.94     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at December 31, 2022 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nand mortgage banking operations, long-term\ndebt, and other funding sources. Truist has\nutilized derivatives to facilitate\ntransactions on behalf of its clients and as\npart of associated hedging activities. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Truist had derivative\nfinancial instruments outstanding with\nnotional amounts totaling $333.0 billion, with\nan associated net negative fair value of $2.3\nbillion. See \u201cNote 19. Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional disclosures.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nFor most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the\nadministrator of LIBOR extended publication\nuntil June 30, 2023. To prepare for the\ntransition to an alternative reference rate,\nmanagement formed a cross-functional project\nteam to address the LIBOR transition. The\nproject team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Truist had outstanding\nLIBOR-based instruments that mature after June\n30, 2023, including loan and lease exposures\ntotaling approximately $135 billion, notional\nderivative exposure totaling approximately\n$131 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion,\nand preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These\namounts are inclusive of remediated contracts,\nwhich contain adequate fallback language for\nthe transition.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases has largely been reviewed and\ncertain contracts will require amendments to\nsupport the transition away from LIBOR.\nImpacted lines of business have started\nremediating these contracts to include\nstandardized fallback language or amending\ncontracts to new reference rates at maturities\nor based on client request. Current fallback\nlanguage used to remediate contracts that\nmature after June 30, 2023 is generally\nconsistent with ARRC recommendations and\nincludes use of \u201chardwired fallback\u201d language,\nwhich will transition loans to a SOFR based\nrate after June 30, 2023.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\nThe progress and approach to remediation will\nvary based on the type of contract and\nexisting language used in the agreement. For\ncommercial lending, a significant number of\nremaining LIBOR contracts will require client\noutreach and remediation. Through mid-2022,\nthe Company\u2019s primary focus was supporting new\nloan production using SOFR and other\nalternative reference rates as well as\ntransitioning any renewing LIBOR based\ncontracts to alternative reference rates.\nEfforts have shifted to amend and remediate\ncontracts, excluding mortgage and student\nloans, that mature post June 30, 2023 ($127\nbillion), which will continue to be the focus\nduring 2023. Of the contracts remaining on\nLIBOR that have not yet been remediated or\nmodified to a new reference rate, Truist\u2019s\nintends to add / update fallback language or\nmove these contracts to new references rates\nprior to cessation. A significant portion of\nthese contracts contain existing fallback\nlanguage that will transition the contract to\na Prime based rate if not remediated, while a\nsmaller population contains no historical\nfallback language. Should the institution be\nunable to remediate all contracts, those based\non Prime will be prioritized to provide a more\nconsistent client experience with the\n\u201chardwired fallback\u201d transition to SOFR. If\nthere are remaining contracts without fallback\nlanguage, Truist may leverage recent\nlegislation and corresponding safe harbor\nprovision to transition these loans to SOFR.\n\nTruist\u2019s adjustable-rate mortgage products\n($3.5 billion) have consistent and adequate\nfallback language to transition away from\nLIBOR in line with industry expectations;\ntherefore, these contracts will not require\nremediation. Remediation of student loans\n($4.7 billion) will follow pending guidance\nfrom the Department of Education on the\nreplacement rate for payment allowances on\ncertain student loans and recent guidance from\nthe CFPB to allow transition to \u201ccomparable\nrates,\u201d in the private student loan portfolio,\nwhere LIBOR is used directly.\n\nUpon the discontinuation of LIBOR, derivatives\nthat reference LIBOR will transition to a\nSOFR-based replacement rate as set forth in\nthe ISDA protocol addressing LIBOR fallbacks\nor as established under the recently passed\nAdjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB. Certain\nderivatives without a clearly defined or\npracticable replacement benchmark rate will\nuse the recent Federal legislation to replace\nLIBOR with a SOFR-based rate established by\nFRB rulemaking and follow the ISDA Protocol\nfor transition. This legislation will also\nprovide additional administrative benefit for\na small portion of the commercial and consumer\nlending portfolios where contracts do not\ncontain fallback language and have not yet\nbeen remediated, providing a remediation path\nto a SOFR based rate.\n\nIn addition, the transition from LIBOR to an\nalternative reference rate, such as SOFR, for\nthe Company\u2019s preferred stock and the\nCompany\u2019s and Truist Bank\u2019s floating rate\nnotes is dependent on a number of factors,\nincluding the fallback language for the\napplicable series of preferred stock or notes,\nthe application of the LIBOR Act and the rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB,\ndeterminations to be made by third-party\ncalculation or paying agents rather than the\nCompany or Truist Bank as to the replacement\nrates, and the impact of any publication of a\nsynthetic U.S. dollar LIBOR as currently\nproposed by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nSee \u201cNote 12. Shareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d for\ninformation about preferred stock using LIBOR.\n\nTraining has been provided for impacted\nteammates and will continue during 2023.\nTruist will continue to provide timely notices\nand information to impacted clients about the\ntransition during the first half of 2023.\nTruist continues to manage the impact of these\ncontracts and other financial instruments,\nsystems implications, hedging strategies, and\nrelated operational and market risks on\nestablished project plans for business and\noperational readiness to support the\ntransition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate for all product offerings,\nexcept on a limited basis, as permissible. The\nCompany is actively using SOFR as a reference\nrate and has originated approximately $119\nbillion of loans, issued $9.9 billion of long-\nterm debt, and has $108 billion in notional\nderivative exposure using this alternative\nreference rate as of December 31, 2022.\nAlternatives, such as SOFR, may react\ndifferently from LIBOR in times of economic\nstress. Truist expects SOFR to be the primary\npricing benchmark used across the industry and\nwill continue to offer additional SOFR based\nproducts. Market risks associated with the\ntransition to alternative reference rates are\ndependent on market conditions as loans are\ntransitioned to alternative reference rates\nduring 2022 and early 2023. Additional\nalternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg\nShort Term Bank Yield, will be supported based\non market demand. Other emerging credit\nsensitive rates will be evaluated as\nadditional alternatives for LIBOR based on\nmarket developments.

Risk\nFactors.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk from Trading Activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\n66 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$12 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of December 31, 2022.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the 12 months\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended December 31,\n2022. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRO policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nCredit risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nthe default, inability or unwillingness of a\nborrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the\nterms of any financial obligation to Truist or\notherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk\nexists in all activities where success depends\non the performance of a borrower, obligor, or\ncounterparty. Credit risk arises when Truist\nfunds are extended, committed, invested, or\notherwise exposed through actual or implied\ncontractual agreements, whether on or off-\nbalance sheet. Credit risk increases when the\ncredit quality of an issuer whose securities\nor other instruments the bank holds has\ndeteriorated.\n\nTruist has established the following general\npractices to manage credit risk:\n\n\u2022 limiting the amount of credit that\nindividual lenders may extend to a borrower;\n\n\u2022 establishing a process for credit approval\naccountability;\n\n\u2022 careful initial underwriting and analysis of\nborrower, transaction, market and collateral\nrisks;\n\n\u2022 ongoing servicing and monitoring of\nindividual loans and lending relationships;\n\n\u2022 continuous monitoring of the portfolio,\nmarket dynamics and the economy; and\n\n\u2022 periodically reevaluating the Company\u2019s\nstrategy and overall exposure as economic,\nmarket and other relevant conditions change.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\nThe following discussion describes the\nunderwriting procedures and overall risk\nmanagement of Truist\u2019s lending function.\n\nUnderwriting Approach\n\nThe loan portfolio is a primary source of\nprofitability and risk; therefore, proper loan\nunderwriting is critical to Truist\u2019s long-term\nfinancial success. Truist\u2019s underwriting\napproach is designed to define acceptable\ncombinations of specific risk-mitigating\nfeatures that promote credit relationships\nthat conform to Truist\u2019s risk philosophy.\nProvided below is a summary of the most\nsignificant underwriting criteria used to\nevaluate new loans and loan renewals:\n\n\u2022 Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash\nflow adequacy is a necessary condition of\ncreditworthiness, meaning that loans must\neither be clearly supported by a borrower\u2019s\ncash flow or, if not, must be justified by\nsecondary repayment sources.\n\n\u2022 Secondary sources of repayment - alternative\nrepayment funds are a significant risk-\nmitigating factor as long as they are liquid,\ncan be easily accessed, and provide adequate\nresources to supplement the primary cash flow\nsource.\n\n\u2022 Value of any underlying collateral - loans\nare generally secured by the asset being\nfinanced. Because an analysis of the primary\nand secondary sources of repayment is the most\nimportant factor, collateral, unless it is\nliquid, does not justify loans that cannot be\nserviced by the borrower\u2019s normal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 Overall creditworthiness of the client,\ntaking into account the client\u2019s\nrelationships, both past and current, with\nTruist and other lenders - Truist\u2019s success\ndepends on building lasting and mutually\nbeneficial relationships with clients, which\ninvolves assessing their financial position\nand background.\n\n\u2022 Level of equity invested in the transaction\n- in general, borrowers are required to\ncontribute or invest a portion of their own\nfunds prior to any loan advances.\n\nRefer to the \u201cLending Activities\u201d section in\nMD&A for a discussion of each loan and lease\nportfolio.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risk                              \n                                              \nLiquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist\nwill be unable to meet its obligations as they\ncome due because of an inability to obtain\nadequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or\n(ii) Truist cannot easily unwind or offset\nspecific exposures without significantly\nlowering market prices because of inadequate\nmarket depth or market disruptions (market\nliquidity risk). Refer to the \u201cLiquidity\u201d\nsection in MD&A for additional discussion.\n                                              \n  Technology Risk                             \n                                              \nTechnology risk is the business risk\nassociated with the use, ownership, operation,\ninvolvement, influence, and adoption of\ninformation technology across the Company.\nTruist has defined and adopted a technology\nrisk framework that provides the foundation\nfor technology risk strategy, program, and\noversight and defines key objectives,\noperating model components, risk domains, and\ncapabilities to manage this risk.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nThe technology landscape is constantly\nevolving, and new and unforeseen threats and\nactions by others may disrupt operations or\nresult in losses beyond Truist\u2019s risk control\nthresholds. Truist maintains a comprehensive\nrisk-based information security /\ncybersecurity framework implemented through\npeople, processes, and technology whereby\nTruist actively monitors and evaluates\nthreats, events, and the performance of its\nbusiness operations and continually adapts its\nrisk mitigation activities accordingly.\n\nTruist\u2019s framework aligns with those of the\nNational Institute of Standards and\nTechnology, Cyber Risk Institute, the\nInternational Standards Organization 27000\nseries, the IT Governance Institute, and the\nControl Objectives for Information and Related\nTechnology, as well as conforms with the\nrequirements and guidance from applicable\nregulatory authorities, including the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council. In\naddition, Truist\u2019s framework, which includes\ninternally and externally focused\ncapabilities, drives the development and\nimplementation of Truist\u2019s data security\nstrategy that is designed to reduce risk while\nenabling Truist\u2019s corporate business\nobjectives.\n\nTruist has built an organization with\ndedicated, skilled talent to operationalize\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity strategy. The\ncybersecurity strategy is enabled by\ncontinuous enhancement of Truist\u2019s\nmultilayered defenses including advanced\ncapabilities for early and rapid cyber threat\nidentification, detection, protection,\nresponse, and recovery. Truist participates in\nthe federally recognized Financial Services\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center as a\nkey part of the Company\u2019s cyber threat\nintelligence and response programs, as well as\nother industry organizations and initiatives\nthat promote industry best practices such as\nharmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber\nreadiness, and secure consumer financial data\nsharing.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTo further mitigate the risks presented by an\nevolving cyber threat landscape, Truist\nprovides data protection guidance to clients\nand promotes data protection awareness and\naccountability through mandatory teammate\ntraining. Truist conducts scenario-driven test\nexercises simulating impacts and consequences\ndeveloped through analysis of real-world\ntechnology incidents as well as known and\nanticipated cyber threats. These exercises are\ndesigned to assess the viability of Truist\u2019s\ncrisis response and management programs and\nprovide the basis for continuous improvement.\n\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity risk program is\noverseen by Executive Leadership and the\nBoard. Regular updates on the status of the\ncybersecurity risk program, including\ninformation security risks and incidents,\nemerging threats, and control environment, are\naggregated and escalated to Executive\nLeadership and the Board. Additionally, Truist\nhas a Cyber Incident Response Team that\nmanages significant cyber-specific events with\nescalation up to Executive Leadership and the\nBoard. Truist\u2019s framework requires annual\nexercises at a minimum to test Truist\u2019s\npreparedness. The Board devotes significant\ntime and attention to its oversight of cyber\nsecurity risk and approves related information\nsecurity policies. Although Truist has\ninvested substantial resources to manage and\nreduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible\nto completely eliminate this risk. Truist\nobtains insurance that protects against\ncertain losses, expenses, and damages\nassociated with cybersecurity risk. See Item\n1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d for additional information\nregarding cybersecurity risk.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nCompliance risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nviolations of laws, rules, or regulations, or\nfrom non-conformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies, and procedures\nor ethical standards. This risk exposes Truist\nto fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of\ndamages, and the voiding of contracts.\nCompliance risk can result in diminished\nreputation, reduced franchise or enterprise\nvalue, limited business opportunities, and\nlessened expansion potential.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risk                              \n                                              \nStrategic risk is the risk of financial loss,\ndiminished stakeholder confidence, or negative\nimpact to human capital resulting from\nineffective strategy setting and execution,\nadverse business decisions, or lack of\nresponsiveness to changes in the banking\nindustry and operating environment. Truist is\ncommitted to fulfilling its overall strategic\nobjectives by selecting business strategies\nand operating businesses in a manner\nconsistent with its established risk appetite,\nachieving profitability/earnings growth and\nmaintaining strong confidence and trust with\nits key stakeholder constituencies.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risk                           \n                                              \nReputational risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, enterprise\nvalue, the Truist brand, and public confidence\narising from negative publicity or public\nopinion, whether real or perceived, regarding\nTruist\u2019s business practices, products,\nservices, transactions, or other activities\nundertaken by Truist, its representatives, or\nits partners. A negative reputation may impair\nTruist\u2019s relationship with clients, teammates,\ncommunities, or shareholders, and it is often\na residual risk that arises when other risks\nare not managed properly.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\ninadequate or failed internal processes,\npeople, and systems or from external events.\nIt includes legal risk, which is the risk of\nloss arising from defective transactions,\nlitigation or claims made, or the failure to\nadequately protect company-owned assets. An\noperational loss occurs when an event results\nin a loss or reserve originating from\noperational risk.\n\nModel Risk\n\nModel risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital from decisions\nbased on incorrect or misused model outputs.\nTruist uses models for many purposes,\nincluding the valuation of financial\npositions, estimation of credit losses, and\nthe measurement of risk. Valuation models are\nused to value certain financial instruments\nfor which quoted prices may not be readily\navailable. Valuation models are also used as\ninputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself,\nregulatory capital, stress testing, and the\nACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs,\nwho are responsible for the development,\nimplementation, and use of their models.\nOversight of these functions is performed by\nthe MRO, which is a component of the RMO. Once\nmodels have been approved, model owners are\nresponsible for the maintenance of an\nappropriate operating environment and must\nmonitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on a recurring basis. Models are\nupdated in response to changes in portfolio\ncomposition, industry and economic conditions,\ntechnological capabilities, and other\ndevelopments.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nMRO manages model risk in a holistic manner\nthrough a suite of model governance and model\nvalidation activities. The risk of each model\nis assessed and classified into various risk\ntiers. Additionally, MRO maintains an\nenterprise-wide model inventory containing\nrelevant model information. Regarding model\nvalidation, MRO utilizes internal validation\nanalysts and managers with skill sets in\npredictive modeling to perform detailed\nreviews of model development, implementation,\nand conceptual soundness. On certain\noccasions, the MRO will also engage external\nparties to assist with validation efforts.\nOnce in a production environment, MRO assesses\na model\u2019s performance on a periodic basis\nthrough ongoing monitoring reviews. MRO tracks\nissues that have been identified during model\nvalidation or through ongoing monitoring and\nengages with model owners to ensure their\ntimely remediation. MRO gauges model risk\nutilizing a collection of key risk indicators,\nwhich are periodically reported to relevant\ncommittees, including but not limited to, the\nModel Risk Oversight Committee as well as the\nBoard Risk Committee. MRO will also present\nmodel risk topics to the Board Risk Committee\nas necessary.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $89.4 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 112% for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2022.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At December 31,\n2022, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 36:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      49,250    $     52,170  \n  FHLB                20,770          49,244  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           85,401         116,600  \n  (after                                      \n  haircuts)                                   \n  Available                                   \n  secured            155,421         218,014  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             15,556          14,714  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     170,977    $    232,728  \n                                              \nAt December 31, 2022, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 4.7 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless. FHLB unused borrowing capacity was $20.8\nbillion at December 31, 2022, down from $49.2\nbillion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to\nincreases in short-term borrowings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Parent Company had 37\nmonths and 35 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n22 months and 19 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for additional\ninformation regarding factors that influence\ncredit ratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nThe following table presents the credit\nratings and outlooks of Truist and Truist Bank\nas of December 31, 2022:\n                                              \n  Tab\u2026                                        \n  37:                                         \n  Cre\u2026                                        \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Bank                                        \n          Moody\u2026    S&P      Fitch     DBRS   \n                                       Morn\u2026  \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A3        A- /     A+ /      AAL /  \n                    A-2      F1        R-1M   \n  Sen\u2026    A3        A-       A         AAL    \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Sub\u2026    A3        BBB+     A-        AH     \n  Pre\u2026    Baa2(\u2026    BBB-     BBB       AL     \n  sto\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Ban\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A2        A /      A+ /      AA /   \n                    A-1      F1        R-1H   \n  Sen\u2026    A2        A        A+        AA     \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Dep\u2026    Aa3 /     NA       AA- /     AA     \n          P-1                F1+              \n  Sub\u2026    (P) A2    A-       A         AAL    \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  out\u2026                                        \n  Cre\u2026    Stable    Posi\u2026    Stable    Stab\u2026  \n  tre\u2026                                        \n                                              \nRecent changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings\nand outlooks include:\n\n\u2022 On January 19, 2022, S&P Global Ratings\npublished Truist\u2019s assigned ESG Credit\nIndicators of E-2, S-2, and G-2, which were\nconsistent with the scores assigned to most\nother banks and which indicated that\nenvironmental, social and governance factors\nhave \u201cno material influence\u201d on the rating\nagency\u2019s analysis of the Company.\n\n\u2022 On August 15, 2022, DBRS Morningstar\nupgraded the ratings of Truist, including the\nLong-Term Issuer Rating to \u201cAA (low)\u201d from \u201cA\n(high).\u201d DBRS Morningstar also upgraded the\nratings of Truist Bank, including the Long-\nTerm Issuer Rating to \u201cAA\u201d from \u201cAA (low).\u201d\nThe trend for all ratings was revised to\n\u201cStable\u201d from \u201cPositive.\u201d The rating actions\nreflected the scale, quality, and diversity of\nTruist\u2019s franchise; the completion of the\nMerger integration; Truist\u2019s diversified\nproducts and geography; and the Company\u2019s\nsound balance sheet fundamentals and\nconservative risk profile.\n\n\u2022 On October 21, 2022, Fitch Ratings affirmed\nthe ratings of Truist and Truist Bank,\nincluding the long-term and short-term issuer\ndefault ratings at \u201cA+\u201d and \u201cF1,\u201d\nrespectively, for both entities. Fitch Ratings\nalso maintained a \u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook for\nall ratings. In affirming the ratings, Fitch\ncited Truist\u2019s diverse business model,\nconservative credit culture, and the\ncompletion of the Merger integration.\n\n\u2022 On November 3, 2022, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService affirmed all of the ratings of Truist\nand its subsidiaries, including Truist Bank.\nMoody\u2019s also maintained a \u201cstable\u201d rating\noutlook for Truist. Moody\u2019s stated that the\naffirmation of Truist\u2019s ratings reflects the\neffective completion of its multi-year\nintegration and Truist\u2019s strong, diverse, and\nresilient platform for organic growth, among,\namong other factors.\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are adequate to meet Truist\u2019s\ncurrent requirements and plans for continued\ngrowth. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nhad $2.1 billion in obligations to purchase\ngoods or services that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Many of the purchase\nobligations have terms that are not fixed and\ndeterminable and are included in the total\namount of obligations based upon the estimated\ntiming and amount of payment. In addition,\ncertain of the purchase agreements contain\nclauses that would allow Truist to cancel the\nagreement with specified notice; however, that\nimpact is not included in determining the\ntotal amount of obligations.

Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital limits, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented internal stress\ncapital ratio minimums to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above internal minimums. Breaches of\ninternal stressed minimums prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist\u2019s capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.5%\napplicable to Truist as of December 31, 2022.\nTruist\u2019s SCB requirement, received in the 2022\nCCAR process, is effective from October 1,\n2022 to September 30, 2023.\n\nPayments of cash dividends and repurchases of\ncommon shares are the methods used to manage\nany excess capital generated. In addition,\nmanagement closely monitors the Parent\nCompany\u2019s double leverage ratio (investments\nin subsidiaries as a percentage of\nshareholders\u2019 equity). The active management\nof the subsidiaries\u2019 equity capital is the\nprocess used to manage this important driver\nof Parent Company liquidity and is a key\nelement in the management of Truist\u2019s capital\nposition.\n\nManagement intends to maintain capital at\nTruist Bank at levels that exceed the minimum\ncapital plus CCB. This will also result in\nTruist Bank being \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for\nregulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is\nmanagement\u2019s intent to maintain Truist Bank\u2019s\ncapital at levels that result in regulatory\nrisk-based capital ratios that are generally\ncomparable with peers of similar size,\ncomplexity, and risk profile. If the capital\nlevels of Truist Bank increase above these\nguidelines, excess capital may be transferred\nto the Parent Company in the form of special\ndividend payments, subject to regulatory and\nother operating considerations.\n\nManagement\u2019s capital deployment plan in order\nof preference is to focus on (i) organic\ngrowth, (ii) dividends, (iii) strategic\nopportunities and acquisitions, and (iv) share\nrepurchases if excess capital is available.\n\nTruist Bank\u2019s capital ratios are presented in\nthe following table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  39:                                         \n  Capital                                     \n  Ratios -

These measures are useful for\nevaluating the performance of a business\nconsistently, whether acquired or developed\ninternally. Truist\u2019s management uses these\nmeasures to assess profitability, returns\nrelative to balance sheet risk, and\nshareholder value. These capital measures are\nnot necessarily comparable to similar capital\nmeasures that may be presented by other\ncompanies.\n\nTruist\u2019s capital level at December 31, 2022\nremains strong compared to the regulatory\nlevels for well capitalized banks. Truist\u2019s\nCET1 ratio was 9.0% as of December 31, 2022.\nThe decline compared to the 2021 CET1 ratio\nprimarily reflects strong loan growth,\nacquisitions, and the impact from the phase-in\nof the CECL transition relief.\n\nTruist increased the quarterly common dividend\n8% during the year, paid $2.7 billion in\ncommon stock dividends or $2.00 per share, and\nrepurchased $250 million of common stock. The\ndividend payout ratio for 2022 was 45%\ncompared to 41% for the prior year. The total\npayout ratio for 2022 was 49% compared to 68%\nfor the prior year, reflecting a greater focus\non deploying capital to fund organic growth\nand acquisitions in 2022. In early 2023,\nTruist declared common dividends of $0.52 per\nshare for the first quarter of 2023.\n                                              \n  Reclassifications                           \n                                              \nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications\nhave been made to prior period information to\nconform to the current presentation.

The\nfinancial position and results of operations\nare affected by management\u2019s application of\naccounting policies, including estimates,\nassumptions and judgments made to arrive at\nthe carrying value of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported for revenues and\nexpenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations and related disclosures.\nUnderstanding Truist\u2019s accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. Accordingly, Truist\u2019s significant\naccounting policies and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\ndetail in \u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation.\u201d\n\nThe following is a summary of Truist\u2019s\ncritical accounting policies that are highly\ndependent on estimates, assumptions, and\njudgments. These critical accounting policies\nare reviewed with the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors on a periodic basis.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s ACL represents management\u2019s best\nestimate of expected future credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolios and\noff-balance sheet lending commitments at the\nbalance sheet date. Estimates of expected\nfuture loan and lease losses are determined by\nusing statistical models and management\u2019s\njudgement. The models are designed to forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic forecast data to historical\nexperience. The models are generally applied\nat the portfolio level to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic data used in the models is based\non forecasted variables for the reasonable and\nsupportable period of two years. Beyond this\nforecast period the models gradually revert to\nlong-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. As a means of addressing\nuncertainty related to future economic\nconditions, the quantitative allowance\nincludes an adjustment that reflects model\noutput calculated using a range of potential\nfuture economic conditions. Expected losses\nare estimated through contractual maturity,\ngiving appropriate consideration to expected\nprepayments unless the borrower has a right to\nrenew that is not cancellable or it is\nreasonably expected that the loan will be\nmodified as a TDR.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions, and considerations with\nrespect to the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.\n\nManagement considers a range of macroeconomic\nforecast data in connection with the allowance\nestimation process. Under the range of\nscenarios considered as of December 31, 2022,\nuse of the Company\u2019s pessimistic scenario\nwould have resulted in an increase to the\nmodeled allowance results of approximately\n$2.2 billion. This estimate reflects the\nsensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate\nto macroeconomic forecast data but does not\nconsider other qualitative adjustments that\ncould increase or decrease modeled loss\nestimates calculated using this alternative\neconomic scenario.\n\nThe Company individually evaluates expected\ncredits losses related to loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nand loans that have been classified as a TDR.\nFor individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is\ndetermined through review of data specific to\nthe borrower and related collateral, if any,\nwhile for TDRs, default expectations and\nestimated prepayment speeds that are specific\nto each of the restructured loan populations\nare incorporated in the determination of the\nALLL.\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is similar to that used to\ndetermine the funded component of the ALLL and\nis measured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default. A detailed\ndiscussion of the methodology used in\ndetermining the ACL is included in \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation.\u201d\n                                              \n  Fair Value of Financial Instruments         \n                                              \nThe vast majority of assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis\nare based on either quoted market prices or\nmarket prices for similar instruments. Refer\nto \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures\u201d for\nadditional disclosures regarding the fair\nvalue of financial instruments and \u201cNote 2.\nBusiness Combinations\u201d for additional\ndisclosures regarding business combinations.\n\nSecurities\n\nTruist generally utilizes a third-party\npricing service in determining the fair value\nof its AFS investment securities, whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. Fair\nvalue measurements for investment securities\nare derived from market-based pricing matrices\nthat were developed using observable inputs\nthat include benchmark yields, benchmark\nsecurities, reported trades, offers, bids,\nissuer spreads, and broker quotes. Management\nperforms procedures to evaluate the fair\nvalues provided by the third-party service\nprovider. These procedures, which are\nperformed independent of the responsible\nbusiness unit, include comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service to other third-party pricing\nsources, review of additional information\nprovided by the third-party pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on security sales to the daily\npricing information received from the third-\nparty pricing service. The Enterprise\nValuation Committee, which provides oversight\nto Truist\u2019s enterprise-wide IPV function, is\nresponsible for the comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service or internally to other third-\nparty pricing sources, approving tolerance\nlimits determined by IPV for price comparison\nexceptions, reviewing significant changes to\npricing and valuation policies and reviewing\nand approving the pricing decisions made on\nany illiquid and hard-to-price securities.\nWhen market observable data is not available,\nwhich generally occurs due to the lack of\nliquidity or inactive markets for certain\nsecurities, the valuation of the security is\nsubjective and may involve substantial\njudgment by management to reflect unobservable\ninput assumptions.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\nMSRs\n\nTruist\u2019s primary class of MSRs for which it\nseparately manages the economic risks relates\nto residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do\nnot trade in an active, open market with\nreadily observable prices. While sales of MSRs\ndo occur, the precise terms and conditions\ntypically are not readily available.\nAccordingly, Truist estimates the fair value\nof residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS\nvaluation model to project residential MSR\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios, which are then discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The OAS model considers\nportfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment\nassumptions, delinquency rates, late charges,\nother ancillary revenue, costs to service and\nother economic factors. Truist reassesses and\nperiodically adjusts the underlying inputs and\nassumptions in the OAS model to reflect market\nconditions and assumptions that a market\nparticipant would consider in valuing the\nresidential MSR asset.\n\nFair value estimates and assumptions are\ncompared to industry surveys, recent market\nactivity, actual portfolio experience and,\nwhen available, observable market data. Due to\nthe nature of the valuation inputs,\nresidential MSRs are classified within Level 3\nof the valuation hierarchy. The value of\nresidential MSRs is significantly affected by\nmortgage interest rates available in the\nmarketplace, which influence mortgage loan\nprepayment speeds. In general, during periods\nof declining interest rates, the value of MSRs\ndeclines due to increasing prepayments\nattributable to increased mortgage-refinance\nactivity. Conversely, during periods of rising\ninterest rates, the value of residential MSRs\ngenerally increases due to reduced refinance\nactivity. Truist typically hedges against\nmarket value changes in the residential MSRs.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nquantitative disclosures reflecting the effect\nthat changes in management\u2019s assumptions would\nhave on the fair value of residential MSRs.\n\nLHFS\n\nTruist originates certain residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans for sale to\ninvestors that are measured at fair value. The\nfair value is primarily based on quoted market\nprices for securities backed by similar types\nof loans. Changes in the fair value are\nrecorded as components of Mortgage banking\nincome, while the related origination costs\nare generally recognized in Personnel expense\nwhen incurred. The changes in fair value are\nlargely driven by changes in interest rates\nsubsequent to loan funding and changes in the\nfair value of servicing associated with the\nLHFS. Truist uses various derivative\ninstruments to mitigate the economic effect of\nchanges in fair value of the underlying loans.\nLHFS also includes certain loans, generally\ncarried at LOCOM, where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nAdjustments to reflect unrealized gains and\nlosses resulting from changes in fair value,\nup to the original carrying amount, and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nare classified as noninterest income. The fair\nvalue of these loans is estimated using\nobservable market prices when available. When\nobservable market prices are not available,\nthe Company uses judgment and estimates fair\nvalue using internal models that reflect\nassumptions consistent with those that would\nbe used by a market participant in estimating\nfair value. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for further description of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting for LHFS.\n\nTrading Loans\n\nTruist elects to measure certain loans at fair\nvalue for financial reporting where fair value\naligns with the underlying business purpose.\nSpecifically, loans included within this\nclassification include trading loans that are\n(i) purchased in connection with the Company\u2019s\nTRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and\ntrading business within the C&CB segment, or\n(iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to \u201cNote 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d and \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\u201d for further\ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s TRS business. The\nloans purchased in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS and sales and trading businesses\nare primarily commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans valued based on quoted prices\nfor identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active by a third-party\npricing service. SBA loans are fully\nguaranteed by the U.S. government as to\ncontractual principal and interest and there\nis sufficient observable trading activity upon\nwhich to base the estimate of fair value.\n\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nTruist uses derivatives to manage various\nfinancial risks and in a dealer capacity to\nfacilitate client transactions. Truist\nmitigates credit risk by subjecting\ncounterparties to credit reviews and approvals\nsimilar to those used in making loans and\nother extensions of credit. In addition,\ncertain counterparties are required to provide\ncollateral to Truist when their unsecured loss\npositions exceed certain negotiated limits.\nThe fair values of derivative financial\ninstruments are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable data for interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments, which\nare related to mortgage loan commitments, is\nbased on quoted market prices adjusted for\ncommitments that Truist does not expect to\nfund and includes the value attributable to\nthe net servicing fee. Refer to \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d for further\ninformation on the Company\u2019s derivatives.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nThe acquisition method of accounting requires\nthat assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin business combinations are recorded at their\nfair values. This often involves estimates\nbased on third-party valuations or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow\nanalyses or other valuation techniques, which\nare inherently subjective. The amortization of\ndefinite-lived intangible assets is based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits to be\nreceived, which is also subjective. Business\ncombinations also typically result in\ngoodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic\nimpairment tests based on the fair values of\nthe reporting units to which the acquired\ngoodwill relates. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for a description of the\nimpairment testing process.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Truist\u2019s reporting units\nwith goodwill balances were CB&W, C&CB, and\nIH. Management reviews the goodwill of each\nreporting unit for impairment on an annual\nbasis as of October 1 or more often if events\nor circumstances indicate that it is more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value.\nFor its annual impairment review, Truist\nelected to perform a qualitative test of each\nof its reporting units.\n\nIn performing the qualitative assessment as of\nOctober 1, 2022, the Company evaluated events\nand circumstances since the last quantitative\ngoodwill assessment, macroeconomic conditions,\nTruist\u2019s own operations, key financial\nmetrics, as well as reporting unit and Company\nfinancial performance, and the industry in\nwhich it operates. After assessing all\nrelevant events or circumstances, Truist\nconcluded that it is not more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is\nbelow its carrying value.\n\nThe Company also performs sensitivity analyses\naround the assumptions used in the most recent\nquantitative test as well as relevant events\nor circumstances in order to assess the\nreasonableness of the assumptions, and the\nresulting estimated fair values. While the\nCompany\u2019s sensitivity analyses did not\nindicate risk of impairment as of October 1,\n2022, future potential changes in these\nassumptions may impact the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit and cause the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit to be below its\ncarrying value. Additionally, a reporting\nunit\u2019s carrying value could change based on\nmarket conditions, asset growth, or the risk\nprofile of those reporting units, which could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the fourth quarter of 2022, concluding\nthat it was not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of one or more of its reporting\nunits is below its respective carrying amount\nas of December 31, 2022.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to income tax laws of the\nU.S., its states, and the municipalities in\nwhich the Company conducts business. In\nestimating the net amount due to or to be\nreceived from tax jurisdictions either\ncurrently or in the future, the Company\nassesses the appropriate tax treatment of\ntransactions and filing positions after\nconsidering statutes, regulations, judicial\nprecedent, and other pertinent information.\nThe income tax laws are complex and subject to\ndifferent interpretations by the taxpayer and\nthe relevant government taxing authorities.\nSignificant judgment is required in\ndetermining the tax accruals and in evaluating\nthe Company\u2019s tax positions, including\nevaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in\nthe estimate of accrued taxes occur\nperiodically due to changes in tax rates,\ninterpretations of tax laws and new judicial\nguidance, the status of examinations by the\ntax authorities, and newly enacted statutory\nand regulatory guidance that could impact the\nrelative merits and risks of tax positions.\nThese changes, when they occur, impact tax\nexpense and can materially affect operating\nresults. Truist reviews tax positions\nquarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new\ninformation becomes available.\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts\navailable to reduce income taxes payable in\nfuture years. Such assets arise due to\ntemporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities, as well as from NOL and tax\ncredit carryforwards. The Company regularly\nevaluates the ability to realize DTAs,\nrecognizing a valuation allowance if, based on\nthe weight of available evidence, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe DTA will not be realized. In determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is necessary,\nthe Company considers the level of taxable\nincome in prior years to the extent that\ncarrybacks are permitted under current tax\nlaws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax\nand taxable income and tax planning strategies\nthat would, if necessary, be implemented.\nTruist currently maintains a valuation\nallowance for certain state carryforwards. For\nadditional income tax information, refer to\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d and \u201cNote 14.\nIncome Taxes.\u201d\n                                              \n  Pension and Postretirement Benefit          \n  Obligations                                 \n                                              \nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions,\nwhich are subject to management judgment and\nmay differ significantly if different\nassumptions are used. The discount rate\nassumption used to measure the postretirement\nbenefit obligations is set by reference to an\nAA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and\nthe individual characteristics of the plans\nsuch as projected cash flow patterns and\npayment durations.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 79\nManagement also considered the sensitivity\nthat changes in the expected return on plan\nassets and the discount rate would have on\npension expense. For the Company\u2019s qualified\nplans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the\ndiscount rate would result in additional\npension expense of approximately $46 million\nfor 2023, while a decrease of 100 basis points\nin the expected return on plan assets would\nresult in an increase of approximately $136\nmillion in pension expense for 2023. This\nestimate reflects the sensitivity of certain\nfactors considered in calculation of pension\nexpense but does not consider all factors that\ncould increase or decrease estimates\ncalculated.\n\nThe calculation of pension assets and\nliabilities is also impacted by the year-end\nvaluation, which takes into account the\ndifference between the actual return on plan\nassets and the estimated return on plan assets\nthat was recognized during the year, as well\nas an updated discount rate based on current\nmarket rates. The year-end valuation resulted\nin a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive\nincome of $1.9 billion for all pension plans.\nAs expected return on plan assets is\ndetermined with the prior year-end\u2019s plan\nasset valuation, the lower year-end plan asset\nvaluation and related amortization of\naccumulated other comprehensive income will\nreduce the expected return on plan assets\ncomponent of net periodic pension cost\nrecognized in other expense in 2023.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 15.

We also have audited the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022 based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2022 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.

Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 81\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matter communicated below\nis a matter arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter\nor on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Certain\nCommercial and Consumer Portfolios\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit losses (ACL)\nrepresents management\u2019s best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe consolidated ACL balance was $4.6 billion\nas of December 31, 2022, including $1.7\nbillion for commercial portfolios and $2.3\nbillion for consumer portfolios. Estimates of\nexpected future credit losses are determined\nby management using quantitative models and by\napplying qualitative adjustments to the\nmodeled results. The models are designed to\nforecast probability of default, exposure at\ndefault, and loss given default by correlating\ncertain macroeconomic forecast data to\nhistorical experience. The models are applied\nto pools of loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The macroeconomic forecast\ndata used in the quantitative models is based\non forecasted variables for a reasonable and\nsupportable period. The qualitative\nadjustments incorporate management judgment\nand are used to account for limitations in\nmodeled results related to current economic\nconditions and other risks in the portfolios.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the ACL for certain commercial and\nconsumer portfolios is a critical audit matter\nare (i) the significant judgment by management\nin determining the ACL quantitative model\nresults and certain qualitative adjustments,\n(ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence\nrelated to the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, and (iii) the\naudit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the Company\u2019s ACL\nestimation process for certain commercial and\nconsumer portfolios, which included controls\nrelated to the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments. These\nprocedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for determining\nthe ACL for certain commercial and consumer\nportfolios quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, including\nevaluating the appropriateness of the\nquantitative models and management\u2019s\nmethodology, testing the data used in the\nestimate, and evaluating the reasonableness of\njudgments used by management in estimating\ncertain qualitative adjustments. Professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge were used\nto assist in evaluating the appropriateness of\nthese quantitative models and the\nreasonableness of judgments used by management\nrelating to certain qualitative adjustments.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor

Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nTruist Financial Corporation is a purpose-\ndriven financial services company committed to\ninspiring and building better lives and\ncommunities. Truist has leading market share\nin many high-growth markets in the country,\nand offers a wide range of products and\nservices through our retail and small business\nbanking, commercial banking, corporate and\ninvestment banking, insurance, wealth\nmanagement, and specialized lending\nbusinesses. Headquartered in Charlotte, North\nCarolina, Truist is a top 10 U.S. commercial\nbank. The Company operates and measures\nbusiness activity across three business\nsegments: Consumer Banking and Wealth,\nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and\nInsurance Holdings. For additional information\non the Company\u2019s business segments, see \u201cNote\n21. Operating Segments.\u201d\n\nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. The accounting and reporting policies\nare in accordance with GAAP and conform to the\nguidelines prescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The following is a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Truist Financial Corporation\nand those subsidiaries that are wholly or\nmajority owned by Truist or over which Truist\nhas a controlling financial interest.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are\neliminated in consolidation. The results of\noperations of companies and net assets\nacquired are included from the date of\nacquisition. Results of operations associated\nwith entities or net assets sold are included\nthrough the date of disposition.\nTruist holds investments in certain legal\nentities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are\nlegal entities in which equity investors do\nnot have sufficient equity at risk for the\nentity to independently finance its\nactivities, or as a group, the holders of the\nequity investment at risk lack the power\nthrough voting or similar rights to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nor do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the entity or the right to\nreceive expected residual returns of the\nentity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if\na reporting entity is the primary beneficiary\nof the VIE.\nInvestments in VIEs are evaluated to determine\nif Truist is the primary beneficiary. This\nevaluation gives appropriate consideration to\nthe design of the entity and the variability\nthat the entity was designed to create and\npass along, the relative power of each party,\nand to Truist\u2019s obligation to absorb losses or\nreceive residual returns of the entity. For\nchanges in facts and circumstances, Truist re-\nassesses whether or not it is a primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE. Truist has variable\ninterests in certain entities that are not\nrequired to be consolidated, including\naffordable housing and other partnership\ninterests. Refer to \u201cNote 16. Commitments and\nContingencies\u201d for additional disclosures\nregarding Truist\u2019s VIEs.\nInvestments in entities for which the Company\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not control, over operating and\nfinancing decisions are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in Other assets in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost,\nadjusted to reflect the Company\u2019s portion of\nincome, loss, or dividends of the investee.\nTruist records its portion of income or loss\nin Other noninterest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. These\ninvestments are periodically evaluated for\nimpairment.\nThe Company reports any noncontrolling\ninterests in its subsidiaries in the equity\nsection of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nseparately presents the income or loss\nattributable to the noncontrolling interest of\na consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nReclassifications\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company\ncombined the presentation of Residential\nmortgage income and Commercial mortgage income\ninto Mortgage banking income within the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income.\nFurther, the Company started including Income\nfrom bank-owned life insurance as a component\nof Other income and Loan-related expense and\nLoss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt as\ncomponents of Other expense within the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income.\nPrior periods were reclassified to conform to\nthe current presentation. Certain other\namounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\n88 Truist Financial Corporation\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nBusiness Combinations\nTruist accounts for business combinations\nusing the acquisition method. The accounts of\nan acquired entity are included as of the date\nof acquisition, and any excess of purchase\nprice over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is capitalized as goodwill.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due\nfrom banks and interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks that have original maturities of three\nmonths or less. Accordingly, the carrying\namount of such instruments is considered a\nreasonable estimate of fair value. Restricted\ncash was immaterial at December 31, 2022 and\n2021.\nSecurities Financing Activities\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell are accounted for as\ncollateralized financing transactions and are\nrecorded at the amounts at which the\nsecurities were borrowed or purchased. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and related counterparty agree on the\namount of collateral required to secure the\nprincipal amount loaned under these\nagreements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements.\nShort-term borrowings include securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, which are\naccounted for as collateralized financing\ntransactions and are recorded at the amounts\nat which the securities were sold. The Company\nmonitors collateral values daily and pledges\ncollateral as warranted under the respective\nagreements.\nTrading Activities\nVarious trading assets and liabilities are\nused to accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of the Company\u2019s\nclients. Product offerings to clients include\ndebt securities, loans traded in the secondary\nmarket, equity securities, derivative\ncontracts, and other similar financial\ninstruments. The Company elects to apply fair\nvalue accounting to trading loans. Trading\nloans include: (i) loans held in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans\nguaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii)\nloans made or acquired in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS business. Other trading-related\nactivities include acting as a market maker\nfor certain debt and equity security\ntransactions, derivative instrument\ntransactions, and foreign exchange\ntransactions. Trading assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recognized within Noninterest\nincome in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Interest income on\ntrading account securities is included in\nInterest on other earning assets. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\ntrading activities, see \u201cNote 16. Commitments\nand Contingencies\u201d and \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance.\nInvestments in debt securities that are not\nheld for trading purposes are classified as\nHTM or AFS.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nDebt securities are classified as HTM when\nTruist has both the intent and ability to hold\nthe securities to maturity. HTM securities are\nreported at amortized cost. AFS securities are\nreported at estimated fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI,\nnet of deferred income taxes, in the\nShareholders\u2019 equity section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses\nrealized from the sale of AFS securities are\ndetermined by specific identification and are\nincluded in noninterest income.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 89\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit related losses are measured on\nan individual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, are highly rated by rating\nagencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. Non-agency MBS in the portfolio\nreflect recent issuances that are highly\nrated, include excess collateral and are\ncollateralized by loans to borrowers with high\ncredit scores and low loan to value ratios.\nTruist utilizes cash flow modeling for the\nevaluation of potential credit impairment on\nnon-agency securities in an unrealized loss\nposition. Cash flow modeling incorporates a\nvariety of factors that impact the long-term\nexpectation of collateral performance.\nImpairment is attributable to factors other\nthan credit when there continues to be an\nexpectation of the collection of all\ncontractual principal and interest.\n\nRelated to any unrealized losses reported in\nAOCI, Truist considers any intent to sell and\nwhether it was more-likely-than-not that the\nCompany would be required to sell those\nsecurities before the anticipated recovery of\nthe amortized cost basis as of the reporting\ndate.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities that are not classified as\ntrading assets or liabilities are recorded in\nOther assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered\nmarketable and measured at fair value, with\nchanges in the fair value recognized as a\ncomponent of Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMarketable equity securities include mutual\nfund investments and other publicly traded\nequity securities. Dividends received from\nmarketable equity securities and FHLB stock\nare recognized within Interest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity\nsecurities that are not accounted for under\nthe equity method and that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered non-\nmarketable and are accounted for at cost minus\nimpairment, if any, plus or minus changes\nresulting from observable price changes in\norderly transactions for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same issuer. Any\nadjustments to the carrying value of these\nnon-marketable equity securities are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNon-marketable equity securities include FHLB\nstock and other equity investments. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities, see \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nLHFS\nLHFS includes primarily residential mortgage\nand commercial mortgage loans that management\nintends to sell in the secondary market and\nother loans that management has an active plan\nto sell. LHFS also includes specifically\nidentified loans where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nThe Company elects to apply fair value\naccounting to residential and commercial\nmortgage loans that are originated with the\nintent to be sold in the secondary market.\nDirect loan origination fees associated with\nthese loans are recorded as Mortgage banking\nincome. The majority of direct origination\ncosts are recorded in Personnel expense. The\nfair value of these loans is derived from\nobservable current market prices when\navailable and includes loan servicing value.\nWhen observable market prices are not\navailable, the Company uses judgment and\nestimates fair value using internal models\nthat reflect assumptions consistent with those\nthat would be used by a market participant in\nestimating fair value.\nFirst lien residential mortgage LHFS are\ntransferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE\nsecuritization transactions, whereby the loans\nare exchanged for cash or securities that are\nreadily redeemable for cash with servicing\nrights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale\nof residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at\ninception of the associated interest rate lock\ncommitments and reflect the change in value of\nthe loans resulting from changes in interest\nrates from the time the Company enters into\ninterest rate lock commitments with borrowers\nuntil the loans are sold, adjusted for pull\nthrough rates and excluding hedge transactions\ninitiated to mitigate this market risk.\nCommercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and\nFHLMC and the Company also issues and sells\nGNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured\nloans. The loans and securities are exchanged\nfor cash with servicing rights retained. Gains\nand losses on sales of residential and\ncommercial mortgages are included in Mortgage\nbanking income and gains and losses on sales\nof other consumer loans are included in Other\nincome.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may\ntransfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At\nthe time of transfer, any credit losses are\nsubject to charge-off in accordance with the\nCompany\u2019s policy and are recorded as a\nreduction in the ALLL. Any additional losses,\nincluding those related to interest rate or\nliquidity-related valuation adjustments are\nrecorded as a component of Noninterest income\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s LHFS,\nsee \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures.\u201d\n90 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSpecifically identified LHFS, where management\nhas committed to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale, are\nrecorded at LOCOM. Origination fees and costs\nfor such loans are capitalized in the basis of\nthe loan and are included in the calculation\nof realized gains and losses upon sale.\nAdjustments to reflect unrealized losses\nresulting from changes in fair value and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nof the loans are classified as Noninterest\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The fair value of these loans is\nestimated using observable market prices when\navailable, but may also incorporate\nconsideration of other unobservable inputs\nsuch as indicative bids, broker price opinions\nor other information derived from internal or\nexternal data sources.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company\u2019s accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased, and if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that at the date of acquisition there is\nmore than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\nUnearned income, discounts, and net deferred\nloan fees and costs includes direct costs\nassociated with loan origination as well as\npremiums and discounts from origination or\npurchase, which are deferred and amortized\nover the respective loan terms.\nOriginated Loans and Leases\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture or until maturity or payoff are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing loans\nor straight-line method for loans with\ninterest-only repayment terms or revolving\nprivileges.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date. Purchased loans\nare evaluated upon acquisition and classified\nas either PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality, including but not limited to risk\ngrades, delinquency, nonperforming status,\nprevious troubled debt restructurings,\nbankruptcies, and other qualitative factors\nthat indicate deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination.\nFair values for purchased loans in a business\ncombination are based on a discounted cash\nflow methodology that considers credit loss\nexpectations, market interest, rates, and\nother market factors such as liquidity from\nthe perspective of a market participant. Loans\nare grouped together according to similar\ncharacteristics and treated in the aggregate\nwhen applying various valuation techniques.\nThe probability of default, loss given default\nand prepayment assumptions are the key factors\ndriving credit losses which are embedded into\nthe estimated cash flows. These assumptions\nare informed by comparable internal data on\nloan characteristics, historical loss\nexperience, and current and forecasted\neconomic conditions. The interest and\nliquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans are amortized or accreted to Interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\nloans with interest-only repayment terms or\nrevolving privileges. In the event of\nprepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums\nare recognized in Interest and fees on loans\nand leases.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 91\nTDRs\nModifications to a borrower\u2019s debt agreement\nare considered TDRs if a concession is granted\nfor economic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower\u2019s financial difficulties that\notherwise would not be considered. TDRs are\nundertaken to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan and may take the form of\nmodifications that result in the stated\ninterest rate of the loan being lower than the\ncurrent market rate for new debt with similar\nrisk, other modifications to the structure of\nthe loan that fall outside of normal\nunderwriting policies and procedures, or in\ncertain limited circumstances, forgiveness of\nprincipal or interest. A restructuring that\nresults in only a delay in payments that is\ninsignificant is not considered an economic\nconcession.\nTDRs can be classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower will be\nable to repay the loan based on the modified\nterms. In circumstances where the TDR involves\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classifies these TDRs as nonperforming.\nThe decision to maintain a commercial TDR on\nperforming status is based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrower\u2019s\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation includes consideration of the\nborrower\u2019s current capacity to pay, which\namong other things may include a review of the\nborrower\u2019s current financial statements, an\nanalysis of cash flow available to pay debt\nobligations, and an evaluation of secondary\nsources of payment from the borrower and any\nguarantors. This evaluation also includes an\nevaluation of the borrower\u2019s current\nwillingness to pay, which may include a review\nof past payment history, an evaluation of the\nborrower\u2019s willingness to provide information\non a timely basis, and consideration of offers\nfrom the borrower to provide additional\ncollateral or guarantor support. The credit\nevaluation may also include review of cash\nflow projections, consideration of the\nadequacy of collateral to cover all principal\nand interest and trends indicating improving\nprofitability and collectability of\nreceivables.\nThe evaluation of mortgage and other consumer\nloans includes an evaluation of the client\u2019s\ndebt-to-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue and certain other client-specific\nfactors that impact the clients\u2019 ability to\nmake timely principal and interest payments on\nthe loan.\nNPAs\nNPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property.\nForeclosed property consists of real estate\nand other assets acquired as a result of\nclients\u2019 loan defaults. Truist\u2019s policies for\nplacing loans on nonperforming status conform\nto guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory\nauthorities. Truist classifies loans and\nleases as past due when the payment of\nprincipal and interest based upon contractual\nterms is greater than 30days delinquent or if\none payment is past due. The following table\nsummarizes the delinquency thresholds that are\na factor used in evaluating nonperforming\nclassification and the timing of charge-off\nevaluations:\n                                              \n       P\u2026                   E\u2026                \n  \u2026    on                   f\u2026                \n  \u2026    N\u2026                   C\u2026                \n  \u2026    (\u2026                   (\u2026                \n       (\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90                   \u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Loans may be returned to performing status\nwhen (i) the borrower has resumed paying the\nfull amount of the scheduled contractual\ninterest and principal payments, (ii)\nmanagement concludes that all principal and\ninterest amounts contractually due (including\narrearages) are reasonably assured of\nrepayment, and (iii) there is a sustained\nperiod of repayment performance, generally a\nminimum of six months.\n(2) The timing of nonaccrual and charge-off\nevaluations are accelerated in circumstances\nwhere the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.\n(3) Or when it is probable that principal or\ninterest is not fully collectible, whichever\noccurs first.\n(4) Depends on product type, loss mitigation\nstatus, status of the government guaranty, if\napplicable, and certain other product-specific\nfactors.\n(5) Student loans are not placed in\nnonperforming status, which reflects\nconsideration of governmental guarantees or\naccelerated charge-off policies related to\ncertain non-guaranteed portfolios.\n(6) Government guaranteed loans are considered\nto be in default once they reach 270 days past\ndue and claims are generally filed once the\nloans reaches 365 days past due. The non-\nguaranteed balance, which ranges from 2-3%, is\ncharged off once the claim proceeds related to\nthe guaranteed portion have been received,\nwhich typically occurs no later than 365 days\npast due.\n(7) Credit cards are generally not placed on\nnonperforming status, but are fully charged\noff at specified delinquency dates consistent\nwith regulatory guidelines.\n92 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nWhen commercial loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, management evaluates\nwhether a charge-off must be recorded. For\ncollateral-dependent loans, this evaluation is\nbased on a comparison of the loan\u2019s carrying\nvalue to the value of the related collateral,\nwhile for non-collateral dependent loans, this\nevaluation reflects management\u2019s conclusions\nwith regard to whether any portion of the loan\nis considered uncollectible. Consumer and\ncredit card loans are subject to charge-off at\na specified delinquency date consistent with\nregulatory guidelines.\n\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\n\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus.\n\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value less\nestimated cost to sell and subsequently\ncarried at LOCOM. Net realizable value equals\nfair value less estimated selling costs. Any\nexcess of cost over net realizable value at\nthe time of foreclosure is charged to the\nALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic\nrevaluations of the collateral underlying\nimpaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The\nperiodic revaluations are generally based on\nthe appraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist\u2019s\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than 12months old,\notherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition of these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \u201cNote 5. Loans and\nACL.\u201d\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management\u2019s best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from or added to the loans\u2019 amortized\ncost basis to present the net amount expected\nto be collected on loans. The ALLL is\navailable to absorb losses on any loan\ncategory or lending-related commitment. Loan\nor lease balances deemed to be uncollectible\nare charged off against the ALLL. Expected\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off\nare incorporated into the ALLL estimate, with\nsuch amounts capped at the aggregate of\namounts previously charged off. Changes to the\nACL are made by charges to the Provision for\ncredit losses, which is reflected in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. The RUFC is\nrecorded in Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments: commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card. The expected credit\nloss models are generally developed one level\nbelow the portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans and leases are further\ndisaggregated by similar risk characteristics,\nsuch as business sector, client type, funding\ntype, and type of collateral. Larger loans and\nleases that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics or that are considered\ncollateral-dependent are individually\nevaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is\ndetermined through review of data specific to\nthe borrower and related collateral, if any.\nSuch estimates may be based on current loss\nforecasts, an evaluation of the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral or in certain\ncircumstances the present value of expected\ncash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s effective\ninterest as described further below. In\naddition to the quantitatively calculated\ncomponents, the ALLL includes qualitatively\ncalculated components.\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic forecast data,\nportfolio composition and loan attributes as\nthe primary inputs. Loss estimates are\ninformed by historical loss experience\nadjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and\ncurrent and expected portfolio risk\ncharacteristics. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough contractual maturity unless the\nborrower has a right to renew that is not\ncancellable or it is reasonably expected that\nthe loan will be modified as a TDR.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 93\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for Company-sanctioned\nmacroeconomic forecast data, including the\nmacroeconomic forecast data for use in the ACL\nprocess. Forecasted economic conditions are\ndeveloped using third-party macroeconomic\nforecast data across scenarios adjusted based\non management\u2019s expectations over a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of two years.\nAssumptions revert to long term historic\naverages gradually over a one-year period.\nMacroeconomic forecast data used in estimating\nthe expected losses vary by loan portfolio and\ninclude employment factors, estimated\ncollateral values, and market indicators as\ndescribed by portfolio segment below.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions, and considerations with\nrespect to the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.\n\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\n\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Truist adopted the CECL\naccounting standard, which changed the manner\nin which it accounts for the allowance for\ncredit losses. Prior to the adoption of CECL,\nthe ACL represented management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable credit losses incurred in the loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe estimation of the ACL prior to the\nadoption did not consider reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts that could have affected\nthe collectability of the reported amounts.\n\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies, and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower\u2019s ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers\u2019 financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan\u2019s guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is reasonably\nassured. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management\u2019s   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting models are\nexpected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic forecast data across scenarios\nand current portfolio attributes as inputs.\nThe models forecast probability of default,\nexposure at default and loss given default by\ncorrelating certain macroeconomic forecast\ndata to historical experience. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the commercial\nportfolios include unemployment trends, U.S.\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates, and property values.\n\n94 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist\u2019s policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all nonperforming\nlending relationships and TDRs with an\noutstanding balance of $ 5million or more, as\nsuch lending relationships do not typically\nshare similar risk characteristics with\nothers. Individually evaluated reserves are\nbased on current forecasts, the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan\u2019s effective interest rate, or the value\nof collateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories, and other types of collateral.\n\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe majority of the ALLL related to the\nconsumer and credit card lending portfolios is\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness, and sales channel. Consumer\nportfolio models are expected loss frameworks\nthat use macroeconomic forecast data across\nscenarios and current portfolio attributes as\ninputs. The models forecast probability of\ndefault, exposure at default and loss given\ndefault by correlating certain macroeconomic\nforecast data to historical experience. The\nprimary macroeconomic drivers for the consumer\nportfolios include unemployment trends, the\nprimary 30-year mortgage rate, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and\nindirect other portfolios include secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used automobiles,\nboats and recreational vehicles. The student\nloan portfolio is composed of government\nguaranteed student loans and certain private\nstudent loans. The government guarantee\nmitigates substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. Private\nstudent loans were originated prior to 2021\nwith a credit enhancement from a third-party\nwhich partially mitigates the Company\u2019s credit\nexposure. The credit card portfolio and other\narrangements within the indirect other and\nresidential home equity and direct portfolios\nare generally unsecured and are actively\nmanaged.\n\nTruist uses delinquency status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n\nThe ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is\nbased on analyses capturing the expected\ncredit losses and the impact of the concession\nover the remaining life of the asset.\n\nExpected recoveries for loans are included in\nthe estimation of the ALLL based on historical\nexperience.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises, equipment, finance leases, and\nleasehold improvements are stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed\nprimarily using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the related\nassets and is recorded within the\ncorresponding Noninterest expense categories\non the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the\nimprovements\u2019 estimated useful lives or the\nlease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived\nasset or asset group, including premises and\nequipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of a long-\nlived asset exceeds its fair value.\nLessee operating and finance leases\nTruist has operating and finance leases for\ndata centers, corporate offices, branches,\nretail centers, and certain equipment.\nOperating leases with an original lease term\nin excess of one year are included in Other\nassets and Other liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases\nare included in Premises and equipment and\nLong-term debt in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating and finance lease assets and\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement\ndate based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. Operating lease\ncosts are recorded in Net occupancy expense or\nEquipment expense based on the underlying\nasset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate\nin determining the present value of lease\npayments when readily determinable, and a\ncollateralized incremental borrowing rate when\nan implicit rate is not available. Lease terms\nconsider options to extend or terminate based\non the determination of whether such renewal\nor termination options are deemed reasonably\ncertain.\nLease agreements that contain non-lease\ncomponents are generally accounted for as a\nsingle lease component. Variable costs, such\nas maintenance expenses, property and sales\ntaxes, association dues and index-based rate\nincreases, are expensed as they are incurred.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 95\nThe impairment policy for a ROU asset is\ndiscussed within the Premises and Equipment\nsection above.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nLife insurance policies on certain current and\nformer directors, officers and teammates, for\nwhich Truist is the owner and beneficiary are\nstated at the cash surrender value within\nOther assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Changes in cash surrender value and\nproceeds from insurance benefits are recorded\nin Other income in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. These policies provide the Company\nan efficient form of funding for retirement\nand other employee benefits costs. See \u201cNote\n9. Other Assets and Liabilities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified affordable housing investments.\nIn computing the provision for income taxes,\nthe Company evaluates the technical merits of\nits income tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The deferral method of accounting is\nused on investments that generate investment\ntax credits, such that the investment tax\ncredits are recognized as a reduction to the\nrelated investment. Additionally, the Company\nrecognizes all excess tax benefits and\ndeficiencies on employee share-based payments\nas a component of the Provision for income\ntaxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. These tax effects, generally\ndetermined upon the exercise of stock options\nor vesting of restricted stock, are treated as\ndiscrete items in the period in which they\noccur. The provision for income taxes does not\nreflect the tax effects of unrealized gains\nand losses and other income and expenses\nrecorded in AOCI. For additional information\nrelated to the Company\u2019s unrealized gains and\nlosses, see \u201cNote 13. AOCI.\u201d\nDTAs and DTLs result from differences between\nthe timing of the recognition of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes\nand for income tax purposes. These deferred\nassets and liabilities are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected\nto apply in the periods in which the DTAs or\nDTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent\nchanges in the tax laws require adjustment to\nthese deferred assets and liabilities with the\ncumulative effect included in the Provision\nfor income taxes for the period in which the\nchange is enacted. A valuation allowance is\nrecognized for a DTA if, based on the weight\nof available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that some portion or all of the DTA will\nnot be realized.\nInterest and penalties related to the\nCompany\u2019s tax positions are recognized in the\nProvision for income taxes in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s activities\nrelated to income taxes, see \u201cNote 14. Income\nTaxes.\u201d\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company records derivative contracts at\nfair value in Other assets and Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends upon whether or\nnot it has been designated in a formal,\nqualifying hedging relationship. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives not designated\nin a hedging relationship are recognized\nwithin Noninterest income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. This includes\nderivatives that the Company enters into in a\ndealer capacity to facilitate client\ntransactions and as a risk management tool to\neconomically hedge certain identified risks\nassociated with assets carried at fair value\nsuch as MSRs, along with certain interest rate\nlock commitments on residential mortgage and\ncommercial loans that are a normal part of the\nCompany\u2019s operations. The Company also\nevaluates its financial contracts to determine\nwhether any embedded derivatives are required\nto be bifurcated and separately accounted for\nas freestanding derivatives.\nCertain derivatives used as risk management\ntools are designated as accounting hedges and\nare used to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates or other identified\nmarket risks. The Company prepares written\nhedge documentation for all derivatives which\nare designated as hedges of (i) changes in the\nfair value of a recognized asset or liability\n(fair value hedge) attributable to a specified\nrisk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as\nthe variability of cash flows to be received\nor paid related to a recognized asset or\nliability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge\ndocumentation includes identification of,\namong other items, the risk management\nobjective, hedging instrument, hedged item,\nand methodologies for assessing and measuring\nhedge effectiveness, along with support for\nmanagement\u2019s assertion that the hedge will be\nhighly effective. Methodologies related to\nhedge effectiveness include (i) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the cash\nflows of the actual derivative and\nhypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the fair\nvalues of the actual derivative and the hedged\nitem.\nFor designated hedging relationships, the\nCompany generally performs

expected. The Company\nmanages its exposures to counterparty credit\nrisk associated with derivatives by entering\ninto transactions with counterparties with\ndefined exposure limits based on their credit\nquality and in accordance with established\npolicies and procedures. All counterparties\nare reviewed regularly as part of the\nCompany\u2019s credit risk management practices and\nappropriate action is taken to adjust the\nexposure limits to certain counterparties as\nnecessary. The Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions are generally governed by ISDA\nagreements or other legally enforceable\nindustry standard master netting agreements.\nIn certain cases and depending on the nature\nof the underlying derivative transactions,\nbilateral collateral agreements are also\nutilized.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject\nto OTC derivative clearing requirements, which\nrequire certain derivatives to be cleared\nthrough central clearing houses. These\nclearing houses require the Company to post\ninitial and variation margin to mitigate the\nrisk of non-payment, the latter of which is\nreceived or paid daily based on the net asset\nor liability of the contracts. The Company\napplies settlement to market treatment for the\ncash collateralizing derivative contracts with\ncertain centrally cleared counterparties.\n\nWhen the Company has more than one outstanding\nderivative transaction with a single\ncounterparty, and there exists a legal right\nof setoff with that counterparty, the Company\nconsiders its exposure to the counterparty to\nbe the net fair value of its derivative\npositions with that counterparty. If the net\nfair value is positive, then the corresponding\nasset value also reflects cash collateral\nheld. The Company offsets derivative\ntransactions with a single counterparty as\nwell as any cash collateral paid to and\nreceived from that counterparty for derivative\ncontracts that are subject to ISDA or other\nlegally enforceable netting arrangements and\nmeet accounting guidance for offsetting\ntreatment.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nderivative activities, see \u201cNote 18. Fair\nValue Disclosures\u201d and \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n               Truist Financial Corporation 97\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the\nfair value of net assets acquired (including\nidentifiable intangibles) in transactions\naccounted for as business combinations. Truist\nallocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s)\nthat are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the business combination.\nThe goodwill of each reporting unit is\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis as\nof October 1 or more often if events or\ncircumstances indicate that it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying value. If, after\nassessing all relevant events or\ncircumstances, Truist concludes that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value,\nthen a quantitative impairment test is\nrequired. Truist may also elect to bypass the\nqualitative assessment and proceed directly to\na quantitative impairment test. In the\nquantitative test, the fair value of a\nreporting unit is compared to the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit. If the fair value\nof a reporting unit is greater than the\ncarrying value, then there is no impairment.\nIf the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue, then an impairment loss is recorded for\nthe amount that the carrying value exceeds the\nfair value, not to exceed the total amount of\ngoodwill assigned to the reporting unit. The\nquantitative impairment test estimates the\nfair value of the reporting units using the\nincome approach and market-based approaches.\nThe income approach utilizes a discounted cash\nflow analysis. The market approach utilizes\ncomparable public company information, key\nvaluation multiples and consideration of a\nmarket control premium associated with cost\nsynergies and other cash flow benefits that\narise from obtaining control over a reporting\nunit, and guideline transactions, when\napplicable.\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates and applicable\nvaluation multiples based on comparable public\ncompany information. Truist also assesses the\nreasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting units by comparison to\nits market capitalization over a reasonable\nperiod of time, including consideration of\nhistoric bank control premiums and the current\nmarket.\nCDI and other intangible assets include\npremiums paid for acquisitions of core\ndeposits and other identifiable intangible\nassets. Intangible assets other than goodwill,\nwhich are determined to have finite lives, are\namortized over their useful lives, based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits received. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nactivities related to goodwill and other\nintangibles, see \u201cNote 7. Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets.\u201d\nLoan Servicing Rights\nTruist has three classes of servicing rights\nfor which it separately manages the economic\nrisks: residential MSRs, commercial MSRs, and\nother loan servicing rights. Loan servicing\nrights are accounted for primarily at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recorded in\nMortgage banking income and Other income on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. The\nfair value of servicing rights is impacted by\na variety of factors, including prepayment\nassumptions, discount rates, delinquency\nrates, contractually specified servicing fees,\nservicing costs, and underlying portfolio\ncharacteristics. These risks are hedged with\nvarious derivative instruments that are\nintended to mitigate the income statement\neffect to changes in fair value. The\nunderlying assumptions and estimated values\nare corroborated by values received from\nindependent third parties and comparisons to\nmarket transactions. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s servicing rights,\nsee \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing.\u201d\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Depending on the nature of the asset or\nliability, the Company uses various valuation\ntechniques and assumptions when estimating\nfair value. The Company classifies inputs used\nin valuation techniques within the fair value\nhierarchy discussed in \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nWhen measuring assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue, the Company considers the principal or\nmost advantageous market in which it would\ntransact and considers assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset\nor liability. Assets and liabilities that are\nrequired to be measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis include trading securities,\nderivative instruments, AFS securities, and\ncertain other equity securities. Assets and\nliabilities that the Company has elected to\nmeasure at fair value on a recurring basis\ninclude trading loans, loans originated to be\nsold and classified as LHFS, and loan\nservicing rights. Other assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, such as when assets are evaluated for\nimpairment, and subsequently carried at LOCOM.\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nvaluation of assets and liabilities held at\nfair value, see \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\n98 Truist Financial Corporation\nEquity-Based Compensation\nTruist maintains various equity-based\ncompensation plans that provide for the\ngranting of RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs to selected\nteammates and directors. Truist values share-\nbased awards at the grant date fair value and\nrecognizes the expense over the requisite\nservice period taking into account retirement\neligibility. Compensation expense is\nrecognized in Personnel expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures\nare recognized as they occur. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation plans, see \u201cNote 15. Benefit\nPlans.\u201d\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions.\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure\nthe postretirement benefit obligations is set\nby reference to an AA Above Median corporate\nbond yield curve and the individual\ncharacteristics of the plans such as projected\ncash flow patterns and payment durations. The\nexpected long-term rate of return on assets is\nbased on the expected returns for each major\nasset class in which the plan invests,\nadjusted for the weight of each asset class in\nthe target mix. For additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s pension plans and postretirement\nbenefit plans, see \u201cNote 15. Benefit Plans.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCompany recognizes two primary types of\nrevenue in its Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, Interest income, and Noninterest\nincome. The Company\u2019s principal source of\nrevenue is Interest income from loans and\nsecurities, which is recognized on an accrual\nbasis using the effective interest method. For\ninformation on the Company\u2019s policies for\nrecognizing Interest income on loans and\nsecurities, see the \u201cLoans and Leases,\u201d\n\u201cLHFS,\u201d \u201cTrading Activities,\u201d and \u201cInvestment\nSecurities\u201d sections within this Note.\nNoninterest income includes revenue from\nvarious types of transactions and services\nprovided to clients. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from contracts with customers as\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nPerformance obligations are typically\nsatisfied in one year or less. Truist elected\nthe practical expedient to expense the\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract when\nincurred when the amortization period is one\nyear or less. As of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, remaining performance obligations\nconsisted primarily of insurance and\ninvestment banking services for contracts with\nan original expected length of one year or\nless.\nInsurance income\nInsurance commissions are received on the sale\nof insurance products as agent or broker, and\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time upon\nthe placement date of the insurance policies,\nrepresenting the Company\u2019s related performance\nobligations. Payment is normally received\nwithin the policy period. In addition to\nplacement, Truist also provides insurance\npolicy related risk management services. The\nCompany\u2019s execution of these risk management\nservices represents its performance\nobligations. Revenue is recognized over time\nas these services are provided. Performance-\nbased commissions are recognized when received\nor earlier when, upon consideration of past\nresults and current conditions, the revenue is\ndeemed not probable of reversal. Insurance\ncommissions are included in the IH operating\nsegment. Refer to \u201cNote 21. Operating\nSegments\u201d for information on segment results.\nTransaction and service-based revenues\nTransaction and service-based revenues include\nWealth management income, Investment banking\nincome, Service charges on deposits, and Card\nand payment related fees. Revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time when the\ntransactions occur or over time as services\nare performed over primarily monthly or\nquarterly periods. Payment is typically\nreceived in the period the transactions occur\nor, in some cases, within 90 days of the\nservice period. Fees may be fixed or, where\napplicable, based on a percentage of\ntransaction size or managed assets. These\nrevenues, and their relationship to the\nCompany\u2019s operating segments, are further\ndescribed by type below. Refer to \u201cNote 21.\nOperating Segments\u201d for information on segment\nresults.\nWealth management income includes trust and\ninvestment management income, retail\ninvestment and brokerage services, and\ninvestment advisory and other specialty wealth\nmanagement fees. The Company\u2019s execution of\nthese services represents its related\nperformance obligations. The Company generally\nrecognizes trust and investment management and\nadvisory revenue over time as services are\nrendered based on either a percentage of the\nmarket value of the assets under management or\nadvisement, or fixed based on the services\nprovided to the client. Fees are generally\nswept from the client\u2019s account either in\nadvance of or in arrears based on the prior\nperiod\u2019s asset balances under management or\nadvisement. The Company also offers selling\nand distribution services and earns\ncommissions through the sale of annuity and\nmutual fund products, acting as agent in these\ntransactions and recognizing revenue at a\npoint in time when the client enters into an\nagreement with the product carrier. The\nCompany may also receive trailing commissions\nand 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and\nannuity products and recognizes this revenue\nin the period earned. Retail trade execution\ncommissions are earned and recognized on the\ntrade date with payment on the settlement\ndate. Wealth management income is included in\nthe CB&W operating segment.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 99\nInvestment banking and trading income includes\nsecurities underwriting fees, advisory fees,\nloan syndication fees, structured real estate\nincome, and trade execution services revenue.\nUnderwriting fees are earned on the trade date\nwhen the Company, as a member of an\nunderwriting syndicate, purchases the\nsecurities from the issuer and sells the\nsecurities to third-party investors. Each\nmember of the syndicate is responsible for\nselling its portion of the underwriting and is\nliable for the proportionate costs of the\nunderwriting; therefore, the Company\u2019s portion\nof underwriting revenue and expense is\npresented gross within noninterest income and\nnoninterest expense. The transaction price is\nbased on a percentage of the total transaction\namount and payments are settled shortly after\nthe trade date. Fees for merger and\nacquisition advisory services, including\nvarious activities such as business valuation,\nidentification of potential targets or\nacquirers, and the issuance of fairness\nopinions, are generally earned and recognized\nby the Company when performance obligations\nare satisfied. The Company\u2019s execution of the\nadvisory services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. The transaction price is based on\ncontractually specified terms agreed upon with\nthe client for each advisory service. Loan\nsyndication fees are typically recognized at\nthe closing of a loan syndication transaction.\nStructured real estate income is recognized\nwhen a build-to-suit or sale-leaseback\ntransaction is closed. The proceeds, net of\nclosing costs, are reduced by the carrying\nvalue of the underlying leased asset. Revenue\nrelated to corporate trade execution services\nis earned and recognized on the trade date\nwith payment on the settlement date.\nInvestment banking and trading income is\nincluded in the C&CB operating segment.\n\nService charges on deposits include account\nmaintenance, cash and treasury management,\nwire transfers, ATM, overdraft, and other\ndeposit-related fees. The Company\u2019s execution\nof the services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. Each\nof these performance obligations are either\nsatisfied over time or at a point in time as\nthe services are provided to the client. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. Payments for services provided are\neither withdrawn from client accounts as\nservices are rendered or in the billing period\nfollowing the completion of the service. The\ntransaction price for each of these fees is\nbased on the Company\u2019s predetermined fee\nschedules. Service charges on deposits are\nrecognized in the CB&W and C&CB operating\nsegments.\n\nCard and payment related fees include\ninterchange fees from credit and debit cards,\nmerchant acquirer revenue, and other card\nrelated services. Interchange fees are earned\nby the Company each time a request for payment\nis initiated by a client at a merchant for\nwhich the Company transfers the funds on\nbehalf of the client. Interchange rates are\nset by the payment network and are based on\npurchase volumes and other factors.\nInterchange fees are received daily and\nrecognized at a point in time when the card\ntransaction is processed, which represents the\nCompany\u2019s related performance obligation. The\nCompany is considered an agent of the client\nand incurs costs with the payment network to\nfacilitate the interchange with the merchant;\ntherefore, the related payment network expense\nis recognized as a reduction of card fees.\nTruist also offers rewards and/or rebates to\nits client based on card usage. The costs\nassociated with these programs are recognized\nas a reduction of card fees. Card and payment\nrelated fees are recognized in the CB&W and\nC&CB operating segments.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is\ncomputed by dividing net income available to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during\neach period, plus common share equivalents\ncalculated for stock options, warrants, and\nrestricted stock outstanding using the\ntreasury stock method.

Management determined that it has\nboth the positive intent and ability to hold\nthese securities to maturity. On the date of\ntransfer, the difference between the par value\nand the fair value of these securities, which\nwas recorded as a loss in AOCI, resulted in a\nnet discount of $ 3.7billion, inclusive of $\n510million of basis adjustment gains from\nterminated fair value hedges attributable to\nthe transferred securities. The discount will\nbe accreted and unrealized loss in AOCI will\nbe amortized, offsetting within interest\nincome over the remaining life of the\nsecurities using the interest method. There\nwere no gains or losses recognized as a result\nof this transfer.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of\ncertain MBS securities issued by FNMA and\nFHLMC that exceeded 10% of shareholders\u2019\nequity are shown in the table below:\n                                              \n                    December                  \n                         31,                  \n                        2022                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars         Amortized            Fair  \n  in                    Cost           Value  \n  millions)                                   \n  FNMA         $      42,312    $     35,446  \n  FHLMC               42,837          35,632  \n                                              \n              Truist Financial Corporation 103\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n             2                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nnoACL was established for AFS or HTM\nsecurities.

These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the December 31, 2022 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2021. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, each\nforecast scenario reflected a moderate\ndeterioration in certain economic variables\nover the reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod when compared to the prior period. The\nprimary economic forecast shaping the ACL\nestimate at December 31, 2022 included GDP\ngrowth and an unemployment rate in the low-\nsingle digits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The December\n31, 2022 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

Significant DTAs and DTLs, net of\nthe federal impact for state taxes, are\npresented in the following table:\n                                              \n  December 31,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)                                   \n  DTAs:                     2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net unrealized        $  4,150    $    488  \n  losses in AOCI                              \n  ALLL                     1,022       1,033  \n  Employee                                    \n  compensation and           765         819  \n  benefits                                    \n  Operating lease            372         389  \n  liability                                   \n  Accruals and               207         245  \n  reserves                                    \n  Federal and state                           \n  NOLs and other             125         113  \n  carryforwards                               \n  Loans                        \u2014          53  \n  Other                      190          59  \n  Total gross DTAs         6,831       3,199  \n  Valuation                 -106        -105  \n  allowance                                   \n  Total DTAs net of                           \n  valuation                6,725       3,094  \n  allowance                                   \n  DTLs:                                       \n  Pension                  1,532       1,416  \n  Goodwill and other         686         630  \n  intangible assets                           \n  Equipment and auto         422         465  \n  leasing                                     \n  MSRs                       345         360  \n  ROU assets                 283         280  \n  Loans                      279           \u2014  \n  Other                      151         173  \n  Total DTLs               3,698       3,324  \n  Net DTA (DTL)         $  3,027    $   -230  \n                                              \n              Truist Financial Corporation 117\nThe DTAs include state NOLs and other state\ncarryforwards that will expire, if not\nutilized, in varying amounts from 2023 to\n2042.

The Company\u2019s\nfederal income tax returns are no longer\nsubject to assessment by the IRS for taxable\nyears prior to 2019. With limited exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to assessment\nby state and local taxing authorities for\ntaxable years prior to 2016. It is reasonably\npossible that the liability for unrecognized\ntax benefits could decrease by as much as $\n14million during the next 12 months due to\ncompletion of tax authority examinations and\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations. It\nis uncertain how much, if any, of this\npotential decrease will impact the Company\u2019s\neffective tax rate.\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Commitments and Contingencies      \n                                              \nTruist utilizes a variety of financial\ninstruments to mitigate exposure to risks and\nmeet the financing needs and provide\ninvestment opportunities for clients. These\nfinancial instruments include commitments to\nextend credit, letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, derivatives, and other\ninvestments. Truist also has commitments to\nfund certain affordable housing investments\nand contingent liabilities related to certain\nsold loans.\n\nTax Credit and Certain Equity Investments\n\nThe Company invests in certain affordable\nhousing projects throughout its market area as\na means of supporting local communities.\nTruist receives tax credits related to these\ninvestments, for which the Company typically\nacts as a limited partner and therefore does\nnot exert control over the operating or\nfinancial policies of the partnerships. Truist\ntypically provides financing during the\nconstruction and development of the\nproperties; however, permanent financing is\ngenerally obtained from independent third\nparties upon completion of a project. Tax\ncredits are subject to recapture by taxing\nauthorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level.\nTruist\u2019s maximum potential exposure to losses\nrelative to investments in VIEs is generally\nlimited to the sum of the outstanding balance,\nfuture funding commitments and any related\nloans to the entity, exclusive of any\npotential tax recapture associated with the\ninvestments. Loans to these entities are\nunderwritten in substantially the same manner\nas the Company\u2019s other loans and are generally\nsecured.\n\nAdditionally, the Company invests in other\ncommunity development entities as a limited\npartner and/or a lender. The Company receives\ntax credits for its limited partner\ninvestments. The Company has determined that\nthe majority of the related partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these investments.\nTruist uses the equity method of accounting\nfor these investments.\n\nThe Company also invests in entities that\npromote renewable energy sources as a limited\npartner. The Company has determined that these\nrenewable energy tax credit partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these VIEs because\nit does not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIEs\u2019 financial performance and therefore, it\nis not required to consolidate these VIEs. The\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to\nthese investments is limited to its equity\ninvestments in these partnerships and any\nadditional unfunded equity commitments.\n\nTruist has investments in and future funding\ncommitments related to private equity and\ncertain other equity method investments. The\nrisk exposure relating to such commitments is\ngenerally limited to the amount of investments\nand future funding commitments made.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 121\n

carrying\nvalue of these investments.\nLetters of Credit and Financial Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, Truist\nutilizes certain financial instruments to meet\nthe financing needs of clients and to mitigate\nexposure to risks. Such financial instruments\ninclude commitments to extend credit and\ncertain contractual agreements, including\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantee arrangements.\n\nCommitments to extend, originate, or purchase\ncredit are primarily lines of credit to\nbusinesses and consumers and have specified\nrates and maturity dates. Many of these\ncommitments also have adverse change clauses,\nwhich allow Truist to cancel the commitment\ndue to deterioration in the borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness. The fair values of\ncommitments are estimated using the fees\ncharged to enter into similar agreements,\ntaking into account the remaining terms of the\nagreements and the present creditworthiness of\nthe counterparties. The fair values of\nguarantees and letters of credit are estimated\nbased on the counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness\nand average default rates for loan products\nwith similar risks. Consumer lending and\nrevolving credit commitments have an\nimmaterial fair value as Truist typically has\nthe unconditional ability to cancel such\ncommitments. Refer to \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures\u201d for additional disclosures on the\nRUFC.\n\nTruist has sold certain mortgage-related loans\nthat contain recourse provisions. These\nprovisions generally require Truist to\nreimburse the investor for a share of any loss\nthat is incurred after the disposal of the\nproperty. Truist also issues standard\nrepresentations and warranties related to\nmortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to \u201cNote 8.\nLoan Servicing\u201d for additional disclosures\nrelated to these exposures.\n\nLetters of credit and financial guarantees are\nunconditional commitments issued by Truist to\nguarantee the performance of a client to a\nthird-party. These guarantees are primarily\nissued to support borrowing arrangements,\nincluding commercial paper issuance, bond\nfinancing and similar transactions. The credit\nrisk involved in the issuance of these\nguarantees is essentially the same as that\ninvolved in extending loans to clients and, as\nsuch, the instruments are collateralized when\nnecessary.\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Commitme\u2026                                   \n  to                                          \n  extend,                                     \n  originat\u2026    $     216,838    $    198,658  \n  or                                          \n  purchase                                    \n  credit                                      \n  Resident\u2026                                   \n  mortgage                                    \n  loans                  200             244  \n  sold with                                   \n  recourse                                    \n  CRE                                         \n  mortgages                                   \n  serviced                                    \n  for                                         \n  others               9,955          10,243  \n  covered                                     \n  by                                          \n  recourse                                    \n  provisio\u2026                                   \n  Other                                       \n  loans                                       \n  serviced                                    \n  for                                         \n  others                 723             588  \n  covered                                     \n  by                                          \n  recourse                                    \n  provisio\u2026                                   \n  Letters              6,030           5,568  \n  of credit                                   \n                                              \n122 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nDerivatives\n\nTruist enters into derivative contracts to\nmanage various financial risks. A derivative\nis a financial instrument that derives its\ncash flows, and therefore its value, by\nreference to an underlying instrument, index,\nor referenced interest rate. Derivative\ncontracts are carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with the fair\nvalue representing the net present value of\nexpected future cash receipts or payments\nbased on market interest rates. For additional\ninformation on derivative instruments, see\n\u201cNote 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.\u201d\n\nTotal Return Swaps\n\nThe Company facilitates matched book TRS\ntransactions on behalf of clients, whereby a\nVIE purchases reference assets identified by a\nclient and the Company enters into a TRS with\nthe VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the\nclient. The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third-party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases. VIE assets\ninclude trading loans and bonds:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  VIE          $       1,830    $      1,519  \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  loans and            1,790           1,491  \n  bonds                                       \n  VIE                    163              50  \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n                                              \nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, which could potentially be\nsignificant. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nOther Commitments\n\nTruist holds public funds in certain states\nthat do not require 100% collateralization on\npublic fund bank deposits. In these states,\nshould the failure of another public fund\ndepository institution result in a loss for\nthe public entity, the resulting\nuncollateralized deposit shortfall would have\nto be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon\nthe public deposits held by each bank within\nthe respective state) by the remaining\nfinancial institutions holding public funds in\nthat state. Truist monitors deposit levels\nrelative to the total public deposits held by\nall depository institutions within these\nstates. The likelihood that the Company would\nhave to perform under this guarantee is\ndependent on whether any financial\ninstitutions holding public funds default, as\nwell as the adequacy of collateral coverage.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Truist\nindemnifies its officers and directors to the\nfullest extent permitted by law against\nliabilities arising from pending litigation.\nTruist also issues standard representations\nand warranties in underwriting agreements,\nmerger and acquisition agreements, loan sales,\nbrokerage activities and other similar\narrangements. Counterparties in many of these\nindemnification arrangements provide similar\nindemnifications to Truist. Although these\nagreements often do not specify limitations,\nTruist does not believe that any payments\nrelated to these guarantees would materially\nchange the financial position or results of\noperations of Truist.\n\nAs a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to\nmaintain a minimum investment in capital\nstock. The board of directors of the FHLB can\nincrease the minimum investment requirements\nin the event it has concluded that additional\ncapital is required to allow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital requirements. Any\nincrease in the minimum investment\nrequirements outside of specified ranges\nrequires the approval of the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency. Because the extent of any\nobligation to increase Truist\u2019s investment in\nthe FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence\nof a future event, potential future\ninvestments in the FHLB stock are not\ndeterminable.\n\nThe Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation for trade comparisons, netting,\nand settlement of fixed income securities. As\na Government Securities Division netting\nmember, the Company has a commitment to the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation to meet its\nfinancial obligations as a central\ncounterparty clearing house in the event the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation has\ninsufficient liquidity resources through a\npotential committed liquidity resource\nrepurchase transaction. Any commitment would\nbe based on the Company\u2019s share of its\nliquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Truist does not believe that any\npayments related to these guarantees would\nmaterially change the financial position or\nresults of operations of Truist.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 123\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of December 31,\n2022. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. In addition,\nthe matters underlying this estimate will\nchange from time to time. Estimated losses are\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolve considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\n124 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived, and seeks damages on a class-wide\nbasis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nCompany previously filed a motion to amend the\nclass definition in which it sought to narrow\nthe scope of the class and renewed motions to\ncompel arbitration against certain class\nmembers, which the court found were premature.\nOn September 22, 2022, the trial court entered\na scheduling order holding that the court will\nconsider such motions after discovery, which\nis ongoing, is completed. Trial is presently\nset to commence on April 29, 2024. The Company\ncontinues to believe that the underlying\nclaims are without merit.\n\nUnited Services Automobile Association v.\nTruist Bank\n\nUSAA filed a lawsuit on July 29, 2022 against\nthe Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nalleging that the Company\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe certain\npatents held by USAA. The complaint seeks\ndamages, including for alleged willful\ninfringement and a corresponding request that\nthe amount of actual damages be trebled, as\nwell as injunctive and other equitable relief.\nThe Company filed its answer and affirmative\ndefenses on October 11, 2022, denying that it\ninfringes any of the patents at issue in the\nlawsuit and asserting that USAA\u2019s patents are\ninvalid or unenforceable. On October 11,\nNovember 7, and November 15, 2022, the Company\nfiled separate petitions at the Patent Trial\nand Appeal Board for inter partes review,\nchallenging the validity of each of the three\npatents asserted by USAA in the lawsuit. If\ninstitution of any of the petitions for inter\npartes review is granted, the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board will review the validity of the\nclaims in the applicable patent(s). On\nDecember 30, 2022, the Company filed a motion\nfor leave to amend its answer to assert\ncounterclaims against USAA in the district\ncourt proceedings for infringing certain\npatents owned by the Company used by USAA\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit systems, which motion is\npending before the district court. The\nCompany\u2019s proposed counterclaims seek damages\nas well as injunctive relief. Discovery is\nongoing, and trial is presently set to\ncommence on March 18, 2024.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 125\nNOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\n\nTruist Bank is subject to laws and regulations\nthat limit the amount of dividends it can pay.\nIn addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to various regulatory restrictions\nrelating to the payment of dividends,\nincluding requirements to maintain capital at\nor above regulatory minimums, and to remain\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective\naction regulations.\n\nTruist is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements administered by the\nFederal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements. Under capital\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany must meet specific capital guidelines\nthat involve quantitative measures of assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated pursuant to regulatory\ndirectives. Truist\u2019s capital amounts and\nclassification also are subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings and other factors. Truist is\nin full compliance with these requirements.\nBanking regulations also identify five capital\ncategories for IDIs: well-capitalized,\nadequately capitalized, undercapitalized,\nsignificantly undercapitalized, and critically\nundercapitalized. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, Truist and Truist Bank were classified\nas \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d and management believes\nthat no events or changes have occurred\nsubsequent to year end that would change this\ndesignation.\n\nQuantitative measures are established by\nregulation to ensure capital adequacy require\nTruist to maintain minimum capital ratios.\nRisk-based capital ratios, which include CET1,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital, are\ncalculated based on regulatory guidance\nrelated to the measurement of capital and\nrisk-weighted assets. The following table\nprovides additional detail on regulatory\ncapital ratios:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Truist is subject to an SCB requirement of\n2.5% applicable to Truist as of December 31,\n2022. Truist\u2019s SCB requirement, received in\nthe 2022 CCAR process, is effective from\nOctober 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. Truist\nBank is subject to a CCB requirement of 2.5%.\nThe SCB and CCB are amounts above the minimum\nlevels designed to ensure that banks remain\nwell-capitalized, even in adverse economic\nscenarios.\n\nAs an approved seller/servicer, Truist Bank is\nrequired to maintain minimum levels of\ncapital, as specified by various agencies,\nincluding the U.S. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, GNMA, FHLMC, and FNMA. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, Truist Bank\u2019s\ncapital was above all required levels.\n\nOn October 1, 2022, Regional Acceptance became\nan operating subsidiary of Truist Bank\nfollowing an internal restructuring to\nstrategically align the auto lending\nactivities within Truist Bank, which will\nresult in funding and operational benefits for\nTruist. Regional Acceptance maintained higher\ncapital levels at the restructuring date due\nto the nature of its loan portfolio and thus\nTruist Bank\u2019s capital ratios increased\nsubsequent to this realignment. Truist Bank\ncommitted to maintaining additional capital\nfor certain Regional Acceptance loans for a\nperiod of time following the restructuring\nuntil such loans are paid off. The amount of\ncapital held at Truist Bank on December 31,\n2022 to meet this commitment was $ 2.7billion.\nThis commitment has no impact on the\nconsolidated capital ratios or capital\nrequirements for Truist.\n\n126 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 18.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\ninvestments totaling $ 385million and $\n440million, respectively, have been excluded\nfrom the table above as they are valued based\non net asset value as a practical expedient.\nThese investments primarily consist of certain\nSBIC funds.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques, and significant inputs\nfor Level 2, and Level 3 assets, and\nliabilities that are measured at fair value on\na recurring basis.\n\nAvailable for Sale and Trading Securities:\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available-for-sale and trading\nportfolios. The Company uses prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes, or\nrecent trades to estimate the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of AFS securities\nwere priced by third-party vendors whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. The\nAFS securities and trading securities are\nsubject to IPV. Management independently\nevaluates the fair values of AFS Securities\nand trading securities through comparisons to\nexternal pricing sources, review of additional\ninformation provided by the pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on any security sales to the\npricing information received from the pricing\nservice. Fair value measurements for trading\nsecurities are derived from observable market-\nbased information including, but not limited\nto, overall market conditions, recent trades,\ncomparable securities, broker quotes and\nFINRA\u2019s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\ndata when determining the value of a position.\nSecurity prices are also validated through\nactual cash settlement upon the sale of a\nsecurity. As described by security type below,\nadditional inputs may be used, or some inputs\nmay not be applicable.\n\nTrading loans: The Company has elected to\nmeasure trading loans at fair value. Trading\nloans are valued primarily using quoted prices\nfor similar instruments in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active by\na third-party pricing service. Trading loans\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 loans held in connection with the Company\u2019s\ntrading business primarily consisting of\ncommercial and corporate leveraged loans;\n\n\u2022 SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government;\nand\n\n\u2022 loans made or acquired in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s TRS business.\n\n128 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nU.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities\nare valued using quoted prices in active over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\nGSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities\nconsist of debt obligations issued by HUD, the\nFHLB, and other agencies, as well as\nsecurities collateralized by loans that are\nguaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. Agency MBS includes pass-through\nsecurities and CMOs issued by GSEs and U.S.\ngovernment agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and\nGNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by\nthe issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including benchmark TBA security\npricing and yield curves that were estimated\nbased on U.S. Treasury yields and certain\nfloating rate indices. The pricing matrices\nfor these securities may also give\nconsideration to pool-specific data supplied\ndirectly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using\nmarket-based pricing matrices that are based\non observable inputs including offers, bids,\nreported trades, dealer quotes and market\nresearch reports, the characteristics of a\nspecific tranche, market convention prepayment\nspeeds and benchmark yield curves as described\nabove.\n\nStates and political subdivisions: The\nCompany\u2019s investments in U.S. states and\npolitical subdivisions include obligations of\ncounty and municipal authorities and agency\nbonds, which are general obligations of the\nmunicipality or are supported by a specified\nrevenue source. Holdings are geographically\ndispersed, with no significant concentrations\nin any one state or municipality.\nAdditionally, all municipal obligations are\nhighly rated or are otherwise collateralized\nby securities backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the federal government. These\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer\nspreads, material event notices and benchmark\nyield curves.\n\nNon-agency MBS: Non-agency MBS included\npurchased interests in third-party\nsecuritizations that have a high investment\ngrade rating, and the pricing matrices for\nthese securities were based on observable\ninputs including offers, bids, reported\ntrades, dealer quotes and market research\nreports, the characteristics of a specific\ntranche, market convention prepayment speeds\nand benchmark yield curves as described above;\nas such, these securities were classified as\nlevel 2.\n\nCorporate and other debt securities: These\nsecurities consist primarily of corporate\nbonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds\nare senior and subordinated debt obligations\nof domestic corporations. The Company acquires\ncommercial paper that is generally short-term\nin nature and highly rated. These securities\nare valued based on a review of quoted market\nprices for similar assets as well as through\nthe various other inputs discussed previously.\n\nLHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are\noriginated to be sold to investors are carried\nat fair value. The fair value is primarily\nbased on quoted market prices for securities\nbacked by similar types of loans, adjusted for\nservicing, interest rate risk, and credit\nrisk. The changes in fair value of these\nassets are largely driven by changes in\ninterest rates subsequent to loan funding and\nchanges in the fair value of servicing\nassociated with the mortgage LHFS.\n\nLoans and leases: Fair values for loans are\nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology\nthat considered credit loss expectations,\nmarket interest rates, and other market\nfactors such as liquidity from the perspective\nof a market participant. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default, and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninter nal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate was\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof each loan. The discount rates used for\nloans are based on current market rates for\nnew originations of comparable loans and\ninclude adjustments for liquidity.\n\nLoan servicing rights: Residential MSRs are\nvalued using an OAS valuation model to project\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios and then are discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified\nservicing fees, prepayment assumptions,\ndelinquency rates, late charges, other\nancillary revenue, costs to service and other\neconomic factors. Fair value estimates and\nassumptions are compared to industry surveys,\nrecent market activity, actual portfolio\nexperience and other observable market data.\nCommercial MSRs and other loan servicing\nrights are valued using a cash flow valuation\nmodel that calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows. The\nCompany considers actual and expected loan\nprepayment rates, discount rates, servicing\ncosts, and other economic factors that are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nadditional information on valuation techniques\nand inputs for loan servicing rights.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities: The Company\nholds derivative instruments for both trading\nand risk management purposes. These include\nexchange-traded futures or option contracts,\nOTC swaps, options, forwards, and interest\nrate lock commitments. The fair values of\nderivatives are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable assumptions for interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit.\nThe fair values of interest rate lock\ncommitments, which are related to mortgage\nloan commitments and are categorized as Level\n3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted\nfor commitments that are not expected to fund\nand include the value attributable to the net\nservicing fees. Funding rates are based on the\nCompany\u2019s historical data. The fair value\nattributable to servicing is based on\ndiscounted cash flows, and is impacted by\nprepayment assumptions, discount rates,\ndelinquency rates, contractually specified\nservicing fees, servicing costs, and\nunderlying portfolio characteristics.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 129\nEquity securities: Equity securities primarily\nconsist of exchange-traded securities and are\nvalued using quoted prices in active markets.\n\nPrivate equity investments: In many cases\nthere are no observable market values for\nthese investments and therefore management\nmust estimate the fair value based on a\ncomparison of the operating performance of the\ninvestee to multiples in the marketplace for\nsimilar entities. This analysis requires\nsignificant judgment, and actual values in a\nsale could differ materially from those\nestimated.\n\nSecurities sold short: Securities sold short\nrepresent debt securities sold short that are\nentered into as a hedging strategy for the\npurposes of supporting institutional and\nretail client trading activities. The fair\nvalue of securities sold short is determined\nin the same manner as trading securities.\n\nDuring 2020, Truist sold non-agency MBS\npreviously categorized as Level 3 that\nrepresented ownership interests in various\ntranches of Re-REMIC trusts.

The remainder of\nLHFS is carried at fair value.\n\nLoans and leases consist of larger commercial\nloans and leases that are collateral-dependent\nand other secured loans and leases that have\nbeen charged-off to the fair value of the\ncollateral. Valuation adjustments for loans\nand leases are primarily recorded in the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated statement of income. Refer to\n\u201cNote 1.

ROU assets are\nmeasured based on the fair value of the\nassets, which considers the potential for\nsublease income. The remaining assets are\nmeasured at LOCOM, less costs to sell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

Company\u2019s corporate and\ninvestment banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At December 31,\n2022, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 15 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 135\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

Additionally, OT&C\nhouses intercompany eliminations, including\nintersegment net referral fees and residual\ninterest rate risk after segment allocations\nhave taken place.\n\nTruist emphasizes revenue growth through the\nCompany\u2019s Integrated Relationship Management\napproach, which is designed to deepen client\nrelationships and bring the full breadth and\ndepth of Truist\u2019s products and services to\nmeet clients\u2019 financial needs. The objective\nis to provide Truist\u2019s entire suite of\nproducts to its clients with the end goal of\nproviding clients the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. To promote\nrevenue growth, revenues of certain products\nand services are reflected in the results of\nthe segment providing those products and\nservices and are also allocated to CB&W and\nC&CB. These allocated revenues between\nsegments are reflected as net referral fees in\nnoninterest income and eliminated in OT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include, but are not limited to,\nthe items as detailed below.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax\nequivalent basis, related primarily to certain\ncommunity development investments. Recoveries\nfor these allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. When significant changes to\nmanagement reporting methodologies take place,\nthe impact of these changes is quantified and\nprior period information is revised. Prior\nperiod results have been revised to reflect\nmanagement reporting methodology changes\nresulting from the integration of heritage\nBB&T and heritage SunTrust measurement\nprocesses and systems. Changes primarily\nrelate to funds transfer pricing and internal\nequity allocations.\n\n138 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 139\n                                              \n  NOTE 22.

In the aggregate, loans\nto the Parent Company and all affiliates\ncannot exceed 20% of the bank\u2019s unimpaired\ncapital and surplus.\n\nDividend payments to the Parent Company by\nTruist Bank are subject to regulatory review\nand statutory limitations and, in some\ninstances, regulatory approval. In general,\ndividends from Truist Bank to the Parent\nCompany are limited by rules which compare\ndividends to net income for regulatory-defined\nperiods. Furthermore, dividends are restricted\nby regulatory minimum capital constraints.\n                                              \n  NOTE 23.

The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP. Truist\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that (1) pertain\nto the maintenance of records, that in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and disposition of\nthe Company\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit the preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP\nand that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with\nthe authorizations of Truist\u2019s management and\ndirectors; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material impact on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate due to changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies and procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the\nparticipation of management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer, the Company conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the\ninternal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission, commonly referred to as\nthe \u201cCOSO\u201d criteria. Based on this evaluation\nunder the COSO criteria, management concluded\nthat the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated\nin their accompanying report, which expresses\nan unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes\nin Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this\nreport, the management of the Company, under\nthe supervision and with the participation of\nthe Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, carried out an\nevaluation of the Company\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that the\nCompany\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective.\n\nThere was no change in the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the fourth quarter of 2022 that has\nmaterially affected, or is likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n\n142 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nITEM 15.
