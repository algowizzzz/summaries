Certain\nOfficers; Election of Directors; Appointment\nof Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements\nof Certain Officers.\n\nOn August 26, 2024, the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee (the \u201cCHCC\u201d) of the Board of\nDirectors of Truist Financial Corporation (the\n\u201cCompany\u201d) approved the grant of one-time\nequity awards (the \u201cLeadership Awards\u201d) as\npart of other changes to its 2024 executive\ncompensation program that are tied to the\nCompany\u2019s 2024 strategic planning process and\nthe previously disclosed sale of the Company\u2019s\nremaining interest in Truist Insurance\nHoldings, LLC and subsequent strategic balance\nsheet repositioning (the \u201cTIH transaction\u201d).\n\nLeadership Awards\n\nThe Leadership Awards were made to Michael B.\nMaguire, Senior Executive Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer, and Dont\u00e1 L. Wilson,\nSenior Executive Vice President and Chief\nConsumer and Small Business Banking Officer,\nto support the retention of key leadership\ncritical to taking full advantage of the\nbusiness opportunities created by the TIH\ntransaction. In particular, the Leadership\nAwards are designed to place a specific\nemphasis on shareholder value creation while\nstill incentivizing these executives to\nmaintain appropriate levels of capital and\nappropriately manage risk.\n\nThe Leadership Awards are entirely in the form\nof performance share units, the ultimate\npayout of which is subject to (i) the\nCompany\u2019s achievement of minimum capital\nrequirements, and (ii) a modifier based on\ntotal shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d) relative to\nthe KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, each measured over\na performance period of September 1, 2024\nthrough August 31, 2027. The TSR modifier will\nresult in a payout level between 75% and 125%\nof target, provided that the minimum capital\nrequirements have been met. The CHCC also has\ndiscretion to decrease Leadership Award\npayouts based on business factors and negative\nrisk outcomes, including industry conditions,\nperformance relative to peers, regulatory\ndevelopments, and changes in capital\nrequirements.\n\nThe CHCC approved Leadership Awards with grant\ndate fair values of $4,500,000 for each of Mr.\nMaguire and Mr. Wilson. In determining the\nsize of the award for each executive, the CHCC\ntook into account the executive\u2019s expected\ncontribution to the success of the Company,\nthe holding power of the executive\u2019s\noutstanding equity awards in an increasingly\ncompetitive environment, the executive\u2019s total\ntarget direct compensation, and the\nexecutive\u2019s skill set and attractiveness in\nthe market for talent.\n\n2024 Executive Compensation Program\n\nThe Leadership Awards are part of other\nchanges that the CHCC made to the Company\u2019s\n2024 executive compensation program tied to\nthe Company\u2019s 2024 strategic planning process\nand the TIH transaction.\n\nIn February 2024, the CHCC determined to shift\nfrom its historical annual incentive\nperformance (\u201cAIP\u201d) award program, which based\nawards on three components and relative\nweightings, to a program that emphasizes a\ncomprehensive evaluation of performance across\nmultiple categories. For 2024, the CHCC\nselected financial metrics for the AIP\nevaluation consisting of eight primary\nfinancial measures (adjusted earnings per\nshare, adjusted pre-provision net revenue,\nadjusted return on average tangible common\nequity, tangible book value per share plus\ndividend growth, adjusted noninterest expense,\nCET1 capital ratio and 1- and 3-year TSR) and\nfive secondary financial measures (adjusted\npre-tax income, adjusted net income to common\nshareholders, revenue, return on average\nassets, and efficiency ratio). The non-\nfinancial strategic priority categories\nselected comprise Transform to Capitalize on\nCompetitive Advantage, Simplify and Optimize\nResources and Controls, Repurpose to\nPerformance, and Winning Behaviors. The CHCC\nconcluded that, with elements of the TIH\ntransaction and outcomes of the strategic\nplanning process still pending or under\nevaluation at the time, its historical\nformula-driven AIP award program could\ndiscourage transformation options that would\nbe in the long-term interests of the Company\u2019s\nshareholders, could be inappropriately skewed\nby results outside of management\u2019s control and\ncould undervalue important strategic and risk-\nmanagement objectives that do not translate to\neasily or immediately quantifiable metrics.\n\nThe CHCC recognized that these considerations\ninvolving the AIP award program also impacted\nthe Company\u2019s long-term incentive plan\nstructure, which for 2023 awards had focused\non relative return on average common equity\n(\u201cROACE\u201d) with a relative TSR modifier. Given\nthe potential effect of elements of the TIH\ntransaction and the outcomes of the strategic\nplanning process still pending or under\nevaluation at the time, the CHCC determined to\nbase 2024 PSU and LTIP awards on a blend of\nabsolute earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) and\nrelative EPS growth, while maintaining the\nrelative TSR modifier.\n                    * * *                     \nThe foregoing description of the Leadership\nAwards does not purport to be complete and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the\nfull text of the form of award agreement for\nthe Leadership Awards, which is included as\nExhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by\nreference.\n                                              \n  ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and          \n  Exhibits.                                   \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits.\n                                              \n                 Description of Exhibit       \n                 Form of Performance Unit     \n                 Award Agreement (Senior      \n                 Executive) for the Truist    \n                 Financial Corporation 2022   \n                 Incentive Plan               \n                 (incorporated herein by      \n                 reference to Exhibit 10.1    \n                 of the Quarterly Report on   \n  Exhibit No.    Form 10-Q, filed August 8,   \n  10.1           2024).                       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 The cover page from this     \n  104            Current Report on Form 8-K,  \n                 formatted in Inline XBRL     \n                                              \n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n  TRUIST FINANCIAL                            \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                           -Registrant        \n                    By:    /s/ Cynthia B.     \n                           Powell             \n                           Cynthia B.
