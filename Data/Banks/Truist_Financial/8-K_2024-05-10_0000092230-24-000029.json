\u201cCompany\u201d)\nis filing this Current Report on Form 8-K\n(this \u201cForm 8-K\u201d) solely to recast certain\nfinancial information and related disclosures\nincluded in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023, originally filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on\nFebruary 27, 2024 (the \u201c2023 Form 10-K\u201d).\n\nThis Form 8-K is being filed solely to recast\nfinancial information and related disclosures\ncontained in the 2023 Form 10-K to reflect the\ndiscontinued operations of the previously\nreported Insurance Holdings (\u201cIH\u201d) segment,\nand the segment realignment, as described\nbelow.\n\nThe Company entered into an Equity Interest\nPurchase Agreement, dated as of February 20,\n2024, a copy of which is included as Exhibit\n2.1 to the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form\n8-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024,\nto sell its remaining equity interests in\nTruist Insurance Holdings, LLC (\u201cTIH\u201d). On May\n6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of\nthese remaining equity interests in TIH. As a\nresult, the historical results of TIH, which\nwas the principal legal entity of the\nCompany\u2019s former IH segment, have been\nreflected as discontinued operations in the\nCompany\u2019s recast Consolidated Financial\nStatements for all periods presented in\nExhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.\n\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe Consumer Banking and Wealth segment was\nrenamed Consumer and Small Business Banking\n(\u201cCSBB\u201d), and the Corporate and Commercial\nBanking segment was renamed Wholesale Banking\n(\u201cWB\u201d). Second, the Wealth business was\nrealigned into the WB segment from the CSBB\nsegment, representing a separate reporting\nunit in that segment. Third, the small\nbusiness banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. As the operations of TIH are now\nincluded in discontinued operations, the\nCompany no longer presents the IH segment\u2019s\noperations as one of its reportable segments\nin the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Exhibit 99.1. The\nsegment disclosures have been revised to\nreflect the segment realignment.\n\nIncluded within Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K\nand incorporated herein are the following\nitems of the 2023 Form 10-K as of and for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, each recast as\nreflected in Exhibit 99.1:\n\n\u2022 Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations, excluding the Risk Management,\nLiquidity, and Capital sections, which were\nnot impacted by discontinued operations or the\nsegment realignment; and\n\n\u2022 Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data.\n\nFinally, the Company is filing with this Form\n8-K the Report of the Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm on the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2023, which is unchanged\nfrom the 2023 Form 10-K, other than the dual\ndate to reflect the recast of the Company\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements to reflect\nthe discontinued operations of the IH segment\nand to reflect the segment realignment.\n\nThis Form 8-K does not revise or update any\nsection or subsection of the 2023 Form 10-K\nother than as expressly noted above. No\nattempt has been made in this Form 8-K, and it\nshould not be read, to modify or update\ndisclosures as presented in the 2023 Form 10-K\nto reflect information, developments, or\nevents that have occurred since the 2023 Form\n10-K was filed, except for (i) matters\nrelating specifically to the recasting of the\npresentation of the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and other disclosures\ndescribed above to reflect the discontinued\noperations of the IH segment, and (ii) the\nsegment realignment discussed above.\nTherefore, this Form 8-K (including the\nexhibits) should be read in conjunction with\nthe 2023 Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s\nsubsequent filings with the SEC, including the\nCompany\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2024, and the\nCompany\u2019s Current Reports on Form 8-K. These\nsubsequent filings contain important\ninformation regarding forward-looking\nstatements, events, developments, and updates\naffecting the Company and its expectations\nthat have occurred since the filing of the\n2023 Form 10-K.
