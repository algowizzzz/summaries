are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead represent\nmanagement\u2019s expectations and assumptions\nregarding Truist\u2019s business, the economy, and\nother future conditions. Such statements\ninvolve inherent uncertainties, risks, and\nchanges in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. As such, Truist\u2019s actual results may\ndiffer materially from those contemplated by\nforward-looking statements. While there can be\nno assurance that any list of risks and\nuncertainties or risk factors is complete,\nimportant factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by forward-looking statements\ninclude the following, without limitation, as\nwell as the risks and uncertainties more fully\ndiscussed in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors in\nTruist\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2020:\n\n\u2022 risks and uncertainties relating to the\nMerger of heritage BB&T and heritage SunTrust,\nincluding the ability to

heritage\nSunTrust;\n\n\u2022 deposit attrition, client loss or revenue\nloss following completed mergers or\nacquisitions may be greater than anticipated;\n\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global\neconomy and adversely impacted Truist\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations,\nincluding through increased expenses, reduced\nfee income and net interest margin, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses;\nthe resurgence of the pandemic in recent\nmonths could reintroduce or prolong these\nnegative impacts and also adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s capital and liquidity position or\ncost of capital, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an\noutflow of deposits, and impair goodwill or\nother assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist is subject to credit risk by lending\nor committing to lend money, and may have more\ncredit risk and higher credit losses to the\nextent that loans are concentrated by loan\ntype, industry segment, borrower type or\nlocation of the borrower or collateral;\n\n\u2022 changes in the interest rate environment,\nincluding the replacement of LIBOR as an\ninterest rate benchmark and potentially\nnegative interest rates, which could adversely\naffect Truist\u2019s revenue and expenses, the\nvalue of assets and obligations, and the\navailability and cost of capital, cash flows,\nand liquidity;\n\n\u2022 inability to access short-term funding or\nliquidity, loss of client deposits or changes\nin Truist\u2019s credit ratings, which could\nincrease the cost of funding or limit access\nto capital markets;\n\n\u2022 risk management oversight functions may not\nidentify or address risks adequately, and\nmanagement may not be able to effectively\nmanage credit risk;\n\n\u2022 risks resulting from the extensive use of\nmodels in Truist\u2019s business, which may impact\ndecisions made by management and regulators;\n\n\u2022 failure to execute on strategic or\noperational plans, including the ability to\nsuccessfully complete or integrate mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\n\u2022 increased competition, including from (i)\nnew or existing competitors that could have\ngreater financial resources or be subject to\ndifferent regulatory standards, and (ii)\nproducts and services offered by non-bank\nfinancial technology companies, may reduce\nTruist\u2019s client base, cause Truist to lower\nprices for its products and services in order\nto maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public opinion, which could damage\nTruist\u2019s reputation;\n\n\u2022 increased scrutiny regarding Truist\u2019s\nconsumer sales practices, training practices,\nincentive compensation design, and governance;\n\n\u2022 regulatory matters, litigation or other\nlegal actions, which may result in, among\nother things, costs, fines, penalties,\nrestrictions on Truist\u2019s business activities,\nreputational harm, negative publicity, or\nother adverse consequences;\n\n\u2022 evolving legislative, accounting and\nregulatory standards, including with respect\nto capital and liquidity requirements, and\nresults of regulatory examinations may\nadversely affect Truist\u2019s financial condition\nand results of operations;\n\n\u2022 the monetary and fiscal policies of the\nfederal government and its agencies could have\na material adverse effect on profitability;\n\n\u2022 accounting policies and processes require\nmanagement to make estimates about matters\nthat are uncertain, including the potential\nwrite down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, and\ninstability in global geopolitical matters or\nvolatility in financial markets could result\nin, among other things, slower deposit or\nasset growth, a deterioration in credit\nquality, or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance, or other services;\n\n\u2022 risks related to originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as a loan\nservicer, including an increase in the scope\nor costs of the services Truist is required to\nperform, without any corresponding increase in\nservicing fees or a breach of Truist\u2019s\nobligations as servicer;\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s success depends on hiring and\nretaining key personnel, and if these\nindividuals leave or change roles without\neffective replacements, Truist\u2019s operations\nand integration activities could be adversely\nimpacted, which could be exacerbated as Truist\ncontinues to integrate the management teams of\nheritage BB&T and heritage SunTrust;\n\n\u2022 fraud or misconduct by internal or external\nparties, which Truist may not be able to\nprevent, detect, or mitigate;\n\n\u2022 security risks, including denial of service\nattacks, hacking, social engineering attacks\ntargeting Truist\u2019s teammates and clients,\nmalware intrusion, data corruption attempts,\nsystem breaches, cyber attacks, identity\ntheft, ransomware attacks, and physical\nsecurity risks, such as natural disasters,\nenvironmental conditions, and intentional acts\nof destruction, could result in the disclosure\nof confidential information, adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s business or reputation or create\nsignificant legal or financial exposure; and\n\n\u2022 widespread outages of operational,\ncommunication, or other systems, whether\ninternal or provided by third parties, natural\nor other disasters (including acts of\nterrorism and pandemics), and the effects of\nclimate change, including physical risks, such\nas more frequent and intense weather events,\nand risks related to the transition to a lower\ncarbon economy, such as regulatory or\ntechnological changes or shifts in market\ndynamics or consumer preferences, could have\nan adverse effect on Truist\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations, lead to\nmaterial disruption of Truist\u2019s operations or\nthe ability or willingness of clients to\naccess Truist\u2019s products and services.\n\nReaders are cautioned not to place

These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. There were\nno significant changes to the Company\u2019s\naccounting policies from those disclosed in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2020 that could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements, and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nfinancial instruments; valuation of MSRs;\ngoodwill, intangible assets and other purchase\naccounting related adjustments; benefit plan\nobligations and expenses; and tax assets,\nliabilities, and expense.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Pronouncements\nThere were no standards adopted during the\ncurrent year that had a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements, and no\nstandards not yet adopted by the Company that\nare expected to have a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements.\n                                              \n  NOTE 2.

Fair value estimates\nrelated to the acquired assets and liabilities\nare subject to adjustment during the one-year\nmeasurement period following the closing of\nthe acquisition. The intangible assets are\nbeing amortized on an accelerated basis over a\nterm of 15.0years based upon the estimated\neconomic benefits received. Goodwill of $\n456million and identifiable intangible assets\nof $ 277million are deductible for tax\npurposes.\n\nOn August 10, 2021, Truist announced it will\nacquire Service Finance, LLC for $ 2.0billion\nin cash consideration, which is expected to\nclose in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\n                                              \n  NOTE 3. Securities Financing Activities     \n                                              \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\nare primarily collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment or agency securities and are\ncarried at the amounts at which the securities\nwill be subsequently sold, plus accrued\ninterest. Securities borrowed are primarily\ncollateralized by corporate securities. The\nCompany borrows securities and purchases\nsecurities under agreements to resell as part\nof its securities financing activities. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and the related counterparty agree on\nthe amount of collateral required to secure\nthe principal amount loaned under these\narrangements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements. At September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, the total market\nvalue of collateral held was $ 1.9billion and\n$ 1.7billion, of which $ 188million and $\n27million was repledged, respectively.

CECL, the ALLL\nfor PCD acquisitions, and other activity.\n\nThe commercial ALLL decreased $ 312million and\n$ 857million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2021, respectively. The\ndecreases for both the three and nine month\nperiods are due to an improving economic\noutlook and lower loan balances.\n\nThe consumer ALLL decreased $ 94million and $\n271million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, respectively. The decrease\nfor the three-month period reflects an\nimproving economic outlook slightly offset by\nloan growth primarily in the residential\nmortgage portfolio. The decrease for the nine-\nmonth period reflects an improving economic\noutlook and lower loan balances primarily in\nthe residential mortgage and home equity and\ndirect portfolios.\n\nThe RUFC decreased $ 39million and $ 88million\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2021, respectively. The decreases reflect\nan improving economic outlook.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. These macro-economic\nforecasts include a number of key economic\nvariables utilized in loss forecasting that\ninclude, but are not limited to, unemployment\ntrends, US real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nrental rates, property values, the primary\n30-year mortgage rate, home price indices, and\nused car prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic and 30%\npessimistic in the September 30, 2021 ACL. The\nprimary economic forecast shaping the ACL\nestimate at September 30, 2021 included GDP\ngrowth in the high single digits through 2021,\nthen slowing to the low single digits in 2022,\nand an improving unemployment rate to the mid\nsingle digits through the end of 2021 followed\nby continued improvement through the remainder\nof the reasonable and supportable period.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The September\n30, 2021 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\naddress risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models including imprecision in\nfuture economic forecasts, uncertainty around\nthe return of consumer and business confidence\nonce stimulus ceases, and the impact of\ngovernment relief programs and client\naccommodations on expected losses.\n\n16 Truist Financial Corporation\nPCD Loan Activity\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is recognized in the\nALLL on the date of acquisition using the same\nmethodology as other loans held for\ninvestment.

predictive of future performance. As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change.\n\nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, that could potentially be\nsignificant. At September 30, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected\n$ 1.6billion of assets and $ 133million of\nother liabilities of the VIEs. At December 31,\n2020, the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet\nreflected $ 1.3billion of assets and $\n41million of other liabilities of the VIEs.\nVIE assets include trading loans and bonds\ntotaling $ 1.5billion and $ 1.3billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law. Assets pledged\nto the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable\nasset discounts when determining borrowing\ncapacity. The Company obtains secured\nfinancing and letters of credit from the FRB\nand FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of credit from\nthe FHLB can be used to secure various client\ndeposits, including public fund relationships.\nExcluding assets related to employee benefit\nplans, the majority of the agreements\ngoverning the pledged assets do not permit the\nother party to sell or repledge the\ncollateral.

The matters range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with multiple class members\nand can involve claims for substantial\namounts. Investigations involve both formal\nand informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThese legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration, or investigation\nand may consist of a variety of claims,\nincluding common law tort and contract claims,\nas well as statutory antitrust, securities,\nand consumer protection claims. The ultimate\nresolution of any proceeding is uncertain and\ninherently difficult to predict. It is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters, if unfavorable, may be material to\nthe consolidated financial position,\nconsolidated results of operations, or\nconsolidated cash flows of Truist.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of September 30,\n2021. This estimate is based upon currently\navailable information and involves\nconsiderable judgment, given that claims often\ninclude significant legal uncertainties,\ndamages alleged by plaintiffs are often\nunspecified or overstated, discovery may not\nhave started or may not be complete and\nmaterial facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nwill change from time to time and actual\nlosses may vary significantly from this\nestimate. As a result, the Company does not\nbelieve that an estimate of reasonably\npossible losses can be made for certain\nmatters. Such matters are not reflected in the\nestimate provided herein.\n\nThe following is a description of a certain\nlegal proceeding in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived. On October 6, 2017, the trial court\ngranted plaintiff\u2019s motion for class\ncertification and defined the class as \u201cEvery\nGeorgia citizen who had or has one or more\naccounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July\n12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least\none overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting\nfrom an ATM or debit card transaction (the\n\u201cTransaction\u201d); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees\nas a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did\nnot receive a refund of those Fees,\u201d and the\ngranting of a certified class was affirmed on\nappeal. On April 8, 2020, the Company filed a\nmotion seeking to narrow the scope of this\nclass, and on May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed\nmotion to compel arbitration of the claims of\nsome of the class members. On February 9,\n2021, the trial court denied both motions as\npremature but held that the issues could be\nraised again after the conclusion of\ndiscovery, which is currently underway.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

Company enters into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, risk\nparticipations, TRS, and credit default swaps.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At September 30,\n2021, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 10 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans. To mitigate its credit\nrisk, the Company typically receives initial\nmargin from the counterparty upon entering\ninto the TRS and variation margin if the fair\nvalue of the underlying reference assets\ndeteriorates. For additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s TRS contracts, see \u201cNote 14.\nCommitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators.

The FRB also\nannounced plans to invite public comment on\nseveral potential supplementary leverage ratio\nmodifications to ensure that the supplementary\nleverage ratio remains effective in an\nenvironment of higher reserves, though such\nproposal had not been published as of the date\nof this report.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer                       \n                                              \nThe FRB assigned Truist an SCB of 2.5%, which\nis effective from October 1, 2021 to September\n30, 2022, at which point a revised SCB will be\ncalculated and provided to Truist.\n\nThe FRB has lifted the restrictions on capital\ndistributions for large banking organizations,\nincluding Truist, that had been in place due\nto the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19\npandemic. Going forward, Truist is subject to\nthe normal restrictions on capital\ndistributions under the SCB framework and\napplicable law.\n                                              \n  Security-Based Swap Dealer Registration     \n                                              \nIn November 2021, Truist Bank conditionally\nregistered with the SEC as a security-based\nswap dealer. As a result, Truist Bank\u2019s\nsecurity-based swaps business is now subject\nto requirements that are similar to the CFTC\nrules applicable to swap dealers, including\ntrade reporting, business conduct standards,\nrecordkeeping, margin, and potentially\nmandatory clearing and exchange trading\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Resolution Plans                            \n                                              \nThe FDIC issued a policy statement in June\n2021 announcing that it will resume requiring\nbank level resolution plans for large banks,\nincluding Truist Bank, and bank-level\nresolution plans will have more streamlined\ncontent requirements. Truist Bank will be\nrequired to submit a bank-level resolution\nplan every three years. During the third\nquarter, Truist Bank was informed by the FDIC\nthat its next resolution plan will be due on\nor before December 1, 2022. The FDIC also\nclarified the content requirements of the next\nresolution plan Truist Bank is required to\nsubmit.\n\nTruist submitted its inaugural resolution plan\nto the FRB and FDIC in September 2021, which\nis currently under review.\n                                              \n  Lifting of Consent Order                    \n                                              \nIn June 2021, the FDIC terminated the consent\norder between SunTrust Bank and the FRB\nrelating to certain identified legacy\ncompliance issues. Truist Bank, as successor\nto SunTrust Bank, committed to comply with the\nobligations in the order in connection with\nthe FDIC\u2019s and FRB\u2019s approval of the Merger.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 39\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nTruist had solid financial performance in the\nthird quarter of 2021 that was driven by\nstrong fee income from a diverse business mix\n- including wealth, insurance brokerage,\ninvestment banking, and positive trends in a\nnumber of other businesses given improving\neconomic conditions. Improving economic\nconditions also led to strong credit\nperformance and a benefit from the provision\nfor credit losses. The Company achieved a\nsignificant milestone in early October with\nthe successful migration of approximately 7\nmillion clients (primarily heritage BB&T) to\nthe new Truist technology ecosystem. In\naddition, Truist completed the retail mortgage\norigination conversion and accelerated the\nroll-out of the new Truist digital app during\nthe third quarter of 2021. Truist continues to\nreaffirm its commitment to achieving $1.6\nbillion in net cost saves on a run rate basis\nby the fourth quarter of 2022. Truist also\ncontinues to closely monitor the COVID-19\npandemic and its effects on stakeholders and\nthe financial markets and is actively\nsupporting teammates, clients, and\ncommunities.\n\nIntegration Efforts\n\nMajor milestones during 2021 include:\n\n\u2022 Completed the Wealth brokerage and trust\ntransitions.\n\n\u2022 Completed the mortgage systems transition,\nenabling clients to get the best of both\nheritage SunTrust and heritage BB&T to meet\ntheir homeownership needs.\n\n\u2022 Continued to activate the Integrated\nRelationship Management approach. Truist\u2019s\nIntegrated Relationship Management approach is\ndesigned to deepen client relationships and\nbring the full breadth and depth of Truist\u2019s\nproducts and services to meet clients\u2019\nfinancial needs.\n\n\u2022 Introduced the new Truist digital app;\nmigrated approximately 7 million clients to\nthe new Truist digital banking experience,\nwith nearly half of clients beginning to use\nthe app\n\n\u2022 Converted heritage BB&T retail and\ncommercial clients to the new Truist\ntechnology ecosystem, the most significant\nmilestone to date.\n\nSupporting Clients\n\nTruist continues to work closely with clients\nas they navigate through the continuing\nchallenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Truist\nsupported clients by being the sixth largest\namongst commercial banks in the second round\nof PPP funding, assisting clients with the\nforgiveness process, and continuing to support\nclients as they transition from payment relief\nprograms. Truist originated approximately $17\nbillion of PPP loans. As of September 30,\n2021, Truist had $3.5 billion of PPP loans\noutstanding.\n\nSupporting Teammates\n\nTruist offered a voluntary separation and\nretirement program to eligible teammates in\nJune 2021. Nearly 2,000 teammates elected to\nparticipate in the voluntary program designed\nto provide tenured teammates flexibility on\nhow they want to manage their career.\nApproximately 50% of those that elected to\nparticipate had separation dates of September\n30, 2021. While Truist is hiring in some areas\nand rightsizing in others through natural\nattrition, planned staffing reductions, and\nthe voluntary separation and retirement\nprogram, Truist is actively supporting all\nteammates affected by reductions with\nopportunities and tools for internal\nplacement, severance payments, and\noutplacement assistance and coaching. The\nCompany recognized $189 million of merger-\nrelated and restructuring charges in 2021\nrelated to the voluntary separation and\nretirement program.\n\nTruist has made progress towards the\ncommitment to increase racially and ethnically\ndiverse teammates among senior leadership\nroles to more than 15% by 2023 with current\nprogress at 14.2% as of September 30, 2021.\nFor early career program hiring in 2021, 54%\nof seats at Truist were filled by candidates\nfrom various diverse backgrounds. Truist\nteammates have received $24 million through\nTruist Momentum, a workplace financial\nwellness program that educates, equips, and\ninspires teammates to manage their money based\non what matters most to them.\n\nSupporting Communities\n\nTruist continued to fulfill its purpose in\nmeaningful ways in the community in the third\nquarter through a number of unique and\ncreative initiatives. Truist expanded its\npartnership with EVERFI bringing literacy\ntools to elementary schools across the nation.\nTruist showed leadership as the first top-10\nbank to join BlackRock\u2019s philanthropic\nEmergency Savings Initiative. Truist Community\nCapital provided over $300 million in equity\nin the third quarter to support communities\nthrough investments in affordable housing,\naccess to healthy foods and education, and\ninvestments in job creation and small\nbusinesses. Truist continued to make solid\nprogress towards the Company\u2019s $60 billion\nCommunity Benefits Plan, ending August 2021 at\n112% of the annual target. In July, Truist\nalso released its second annual Corporate\nSocial Responsibility and Environmental,\nSocial and Governance report to outline its\nadvancements and commitments with regard to\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion;\nenvironmental sustainability and climate\nchange; governance; community involvement; and\nfinancial inclusion.\n\n40 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nExecutive Leadership changes\n\nDuring the third quarter Truist announced its\nnew executive leadership structure effective\nSeptember 1, 2021. As previously announced as\npart of the Merger, William H. Rogers, Jr.\nsucceeded Kelly S. King as CEO on September\n12, 2021 and Kelly S.

On a diluted per common\nshare basis, earnings for the third quarter of\n2021 were $1.20, an increase of $0.41 compared\nto the third quarter of 2020. Truist\u2019s results\nof operations for the third quarter of 2021\nproduced an annualized return on average\nassets of 1.28% and an annualized return on\naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity of 10.2%\ncompared to prior year returns of 0.91% and\n6.9%, respectively. Results for the third\nquarter of 2021 included merger-related and\nrestructuring charges of $172 million ($132\nmillion after-tax), incremental operating\nexpenses related to the Merger of $191 million\n($147 million after-tax), and a one-time\nprofessional fee expense of $30 million ($23\nmillion after-tax). Results for the third\nquarter of 2020 included $236 million ($181\nmillion after-tax) of merger-related and\nrestructuring charges, $152 million ($115\nmillion after-tax) of incremental operating\nexpenses related to the Merger, securities\ngains of $104 million ($80 million after-tax),\nand a charitable contribution of $50 million\n($38 million after-tax).\n\nTruist\u2019s revenue for the third quarter of 2021\nwas $5.6 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was\nalso $5.6 billion for the third quarter of\n2021, an increase of $25 million, or 0.4%,\ncompared to the same period in 2020. Excluding\nsecurities gains of $104 million from the\nthird quarter of 2020, adjusted taxable\nequivalent revenues increased $129 million, or\n2.3%, compared to the earlier quarter.\n\nTE net interest income for the third quarter\nof 2021 was down $130 million, or 3.8%,\ncompared to the earlier quarter due to lower\npurchase accounting accretion, lower rates on\nearning assets, and a decrease in loans. These\ndecreases were partially offset by growth in\nthe securities portfolio, lower funding costs,\nhigher fees on PPP loans, and fewer interest\ndeferrals on COVID-19 loan accommodations.\nAverage earning assets increased $26.4\nbillion, or 6.1%, compared to the earlier\nquarter. The increase in average earning\nassets reflects a $66.4 billion, or 83%,\nincrease in average securities, while average\ntotal loans and leases decreased $25.4\nbillion, or 8.0%, and average other earning\nassets decreased $16.5 billion, or 46%. The\ngrowth in average earning assets is a result\nof an increase in investment securities driven\nby strong deposit growth resulting from fiscal\nand monetary stimulus. Average deposits\nincreased $30.5 billion, or 8.2%, compared to\nthe earlier quarter, while average long-term\ndebt and short-term borrowings decreased $3.6\nbillion, or 8.8%, and $849 million, or 14%,\nrespectively.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.81%, down 29 basis\npoints compared to the same period in 2020.\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nthird quarter of 2021 was 3.90%, down 14 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter,\nreflecting the impact of lower purchase\naccounting accretion and a lower rate\nenvironment. The yield on the average\nsecurities portfolio was 1.50%, down 47 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter\nprimarily due to lower yields on new\npurchases.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was a benefit\nof $324 million, compared to a cost of $421\nmillion for the same period in 2020. The\nearlier quarter reflected significant\nuncertainty related to the economic impacts\nresulting from the pandemic, whereas the\ncurrent quarter includes a reserve release due\nto the improving economic outlook. Net charge-\noffs for the third quarter of 2021 totaled\n$135 million compared to $326 million in the\nearlier quarter. The third quarter of 2020\nincluded $97 million of charge-offs related to\nthe implementation of CECL, which required a\ngross up of loan carrying values in connection\nwith the establishment of an allowance on PCD\nloans. The net charge-off ratio for the\ncurrent quarter of 0.19% was down 23 basis\npoints compared to the third quarter 2020, due\nprimarily to the additional losses on PCD\nloans taken in the earlier quarter and lower\nactual net losses in the commercial portfolio.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 41\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of\n2021 increased $155 million, or 7.0%, compared\nto the same period in 2020. Noninterest income\nfor the third quarter of 2020 included $104\nmillion of securities gains on available-for-\nsale securities. Excluding securities gains,\nnoninterest income increased $259 million, or\n12%, compared to the earlier quarter.\nInsurance income increased $127 million due to\nacquisitions, as well as organic growth.\nInvestment banking and trading income\nincreased $57 million due to strong merger and\nacquisition activity and loan syndications.\nWealth management income increased $32 million\ndue to higher valuations of assets under\nmanagement. Residential mortgage banking\nincome decreased $42 million primarily due to\nlower production related revenues as a result\nof lower gain on sale margins and volumes,\npartially offset by higher servicing income\ndue to increases in the valuation of mortgage\nservicing rights and lower prepayment rates.\nAdditionally, there were increases in service\ncharges on deposit accounts, other income, and\ncard and payment related fees due to improved\neconomic activity.\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of\n2021 was up $40 million, or 1.1%, compared to\nthe same period in 2020. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges decreased $64 million\nprimarily due to facilities impairments in the\nearlier quarter, while incremental operating\nexpenses related to the Merger increased $39\nmillion, primarily reflected in professional\nfees and outside processing. The current\nquarter also includes a $30 million\nprofessional fee to develop an ongoing program\nto identify, prioritize, and roadmap teammate\ngenerated revenue growth and expense savings\nopportunities beyond the Merger. The earlier\nquarter included $50 million for charitable\ncontributions to the Truist Charitable Fund\n(other expense). Excluding the aforementioned\nitems and changes in amortization of\nintangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was\nup $110 million, or 3.5%, compared to the\nearlier quarter. Additionally, increases in\npersonnel expense of $129 million were\npartially offset by a decline in net occupancy\nexpense of $46 million and other expense of\n$72 million.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $423\nmillion for the third quarter of 2021,\ncompared to $255 million for the same period\nin 2020. This produced an effective tax rate\nfor the third quarter of 2021 of 19.9%,\ncompared to 18.3% for the earlier quarter. The\nhigher effective tax rate is primarily due to\nhigher pre-tax income in the current quarter\nwithout a corresponding increase in beneficial\ntax items.\n\nTruist\u2019s total assets at September 30, 2021\nwere $529.9 billion, an increase of $20.7\nbillion, or 4.1%, compared to December 31,\n2020. The increase in total assets was\nprimarily a result of strong deposit growth,\nthe deployment of which led to an increase in\nAFS securities of $30.3 billion, which was\npartially offset by a $15.1 billion decline in\ntotal loans and leases.\n\nTotal deposits at September 30, 2021 were\n$405.9 billion, an increase of $24.8 billion,\nor 6.5%, compared to December 31, 2020.\nDeposit growth was strong during the first\nnine months of 2021 resulting from fiscal and\nmonetary stimulus, partially offset by the\nmaturity of higher-cost personal accounts.\n\nAsset quality remains excellent, reflecting\nTruist\u2019s prudent risk culture, diverse\nportfolio, improving economic conditions, and\nthe ongoing effects of government stimulus. As\nof September 30, 2021, nonperforming assets\nwere 0.23% of total assets, down four basis\npoints from December 31, 2020. The allowance\nfor loan and lease loss coverage ratio was\n4.35x nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment, compared to 4.39x at December 31,\n2020.\n\nTruist maintained strong capital and\nliquidity. As of September 30, 2021, the CET1\nratio was 10.1% and the average LCR was 114%.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2021,\nTruist completed $1.1 billion of share\nrepurchases and redeemed $1.4 billion of\npreferred stock. Additionally, the Company had\n$5.8 billion of senior long term debt\nmaturities and redemptions, partially offset\nby $4.5 billion of issuances. Truist increased\nthe common dividend 7% during the third\nquarter to $0.48 per share, resulting in\ndividend and total payout ratios for the third\nquarter of 2021 of 40%. In October 2021,\nTruist declared common dividends of $0.48 per\nshare for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nTruist continues to target a CET1 ratio of\napproximately 9.75% over the near-term. As\npreviously communicated, the Company expects\nto be able to, with appropriate approvals from\nits Board of Directors, deploy approximately\n$4 billion to $5 billion of capital (either in\nthe form of share repurchases or acquisitions)\nbetween 3Q21 and 3Q22. During the third\nquarter of 2021, Truist completed the\nacquisition of Constellation Affiliated\nPartners and announced the acquisition of\nService Finance, LLC, reducing the amount of\ncapital deployment available for acquisitions\nor share repurchases to approximately $1\nbillion to $2 billion through 3Q22. Truist\nresumed repurchasing shares and expects to\nconsume approximately $500 million of this\ncapacity via share repurchases in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 reflecting the Company\u2019s\nstrong capital position, and the reduced\nintegration risk with successful migration of\nheritage BB&T retail and commercial clients to\nthe Truist ecosystem.\n\n42 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nThird Quarter 2021 compared to Third Quarter\n2020\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of\n2021 was down $130 million, or 3.8%, compared\nto the earlier quarter due to lower purchase\naccounting accretion, lower rates on earning\nassets, and a decrease in loans. These\ndecreases were partially offset by growth in\nthe securities portfolio, lower funding costs,\nhigher fees on Payroll Protection Program\nloans, and fewer interest deferrals on\nCOVID-19 loan accommodations. Average earning\nassets increased $26.4 billion, or 6.1%,\ncompared to the earlier quarter. The increase\nin average earning assets reflects a $66.4\nbillion, or 83%, increase in average\nsecurities, while average total loans and\nleases decreased $25.4 billion, or 8.0%, and\naverage other earning assets decreased $16.5\nbillion, or 46%. The growth in average earning\nassets is a result of an increase in\ninvestment securities driven by strong deposit\ngrowth resulting from fiscal and monetary\nstimulus. Average deposits increased $30.5\nbillion, or 8.2%, compared to the earlier\nquarter, while average long-term debt and\nshort-term borrowings decreased $3.6 billion,\nor 8.8%, and $849 million, or 14%,\nrespectively.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.81%, down 29 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter. The\nyield on the total loan portfolio for the\nthird quarter of 2021 was 3.90%, down 14 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter,\nreflecting the impact of lower purchase\naccounting accretion and a lower rate\nenvironment. The yield on the average\nsecurities portfolio was 1.50%, down 47 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter\nprimarily due to lower yields on new\npurchases.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.03%,\ndown seven basis points compared to the\nearlier quarter. The average rate on short-\nterm borrowings was 0.68%, down 17 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter. The\naverage rate on long-term debt was 1.61%, up\n13 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter. The lower rates on deposits and\nshort-term borrowings reflect the lower rate\nenvironment. The higher rates on long-term\ndebt was due to the runoff of lower rate FHLB\nadvances.\n\nNine Months of 2021 compared to Nine Months of\n2020\n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 was down $710 million, or\n6.7%, compared to the prior period due to\nlower purchase accounting accretion, lower\nrates on earning assets, and a decrease in\nloans. These decreases were partially offset\nby growth in the securities portfolio, lower\nfunding costs, higher fees on Payroll\nProtection Program loans, and fewer interest\ndeferrals on COVID-19 loan accommodations.\nAverage earning assets increased $21.8\nbillion, or 5.0%, compared to the prior\nperiod. The increase in average earning assets\nreflects a $57.9 billion, or 75%, increase in\naverage securities, while average total loans\nand leases decreased $22.4 billion, or 7.1%,\nand average other earning assets decreased\n$14.3 billion, or 42%. The growth in average\nearning assets is a result of an increase in\ninvestment securities driven by strong deposit\ngrowth resulting from fiscal and monetary\nstimulus. Average deposits increased $34.9\nbillion, or 9.7%, compared to the prior\nperiod, while average long-term debt and\nshort-term borrowings decreased $10.3 billion,\nor 22%, and $5.3 billion, or 46%,\nrespectively.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.90% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021, down 36 basis\npoints compared to the prior period. The yield\non the total loan portfolio for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 was 4.00%,\ndown 39 basis points compared to the prior\nperiod, reflecting the impact of lower\npurchase accounting accretion and the lower\nrate environment. The yield on the average\nsecurities portfolio was 1.48% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021, down 83 basis\npoints compared to the prior period primarily\ndue to lower yields on new purchases and\npremium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.04%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2021,\ndown 23 basis points compared to the prior\nperiod. The average rate on short-term\nborrowings was 0.84% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, down 62 basis points\ncompared to the prior period. The average rate\non long-term debt was 1.59% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021, down 19 basis\npoints compared to the prior period. The lower\nrates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect\nthe lower rate environment.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio, deposits, and long-term debt\nwere $1.5 billion, $9 million, and $157\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31,\n2020, the remaining unamortized fair value\nmarks on the loan and lease portfolio,\ndeposits and long-term debt were $2.4 billion,\n$19 million, and $216 million, respectively.\n\nThe remaining unamortized fair value mark on\nloans and leases consists of $807 million for\nconsumer loans and leases, and $733 million\nfor commercial loans and leases. These amounts\nwill be recognized over the remaining\ncontractual lives of the underlying\ninstruments or as paydowns occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 43\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

The decline in loans 90 days or more\npast due and still accruing was primarily in\nresidential mortgages and student loans.\nExcluding government guaranteed loans, the\nratio of loans 90 days or more past due and\nstill accruing as a percentage of loans and\nleases was 0.03% at September 30, 2021, down\none basis point from June 30, 2021.\n\nLoans 30-89 days past due and still accruing\nof $1.8 billion at September 30, 2021 were\nstable compared to the prior quarter.\n\nProblem loans include NPLs and loans that are\n90 days or more past due and still accruing as\ndisclosed in Table 10.

As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on a loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES\nAct, Truist implemented loan modification\nprograms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nin order to provide borrowers with flexibility\nwith respect to repayment terms. Payment\nrelief assistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-\naging programs, along with certain other\nmodification strategies. The Company adopted\ncertain provisions of the CARES Act and other\nregulatory guidance that provide relief from\nthe requirement to apply TDR accounting to (1)\ncertain modifications of federally backed\nmortgages upon request from the borrower, and\n(2) certain modifications of other non-\nfederally backed mortgages for borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that were\nless than 30 days past due at December 31,\n2019.

SunTrust prior to the\nMerger date are not included in Truist\u2019s TDR\ndisclosure because all such loans were\nrecorded at fair value and a new accounting\nbasis was established as of the Merger

When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nTruist estimates second lien loans where the\nfirst lien is delinquent based on historical\nexperience; the increased risk of loss on\nthese credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, Truist held or serviced\nthe first lien on 30% of its second lien\npositions.\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 17:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in              September         December  \n  millions)        30, 2021         31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life         $      6,512    $       6,479  \n  insurance                                   \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other           6,012            5,685  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension             4,814            4,358  \n  assets                                      \n  Derivati\u2026           2,976            3,837  \n  assets                                      \n  Accrued             1,841            1,934  \n  income                                      \n  Accounts            1,910            1,833  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Leased                                      \n  assets                                      \n  and                 1,846            1,810  \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  ROU                 1,207            1,333  \n  assets                                      \n  Prepaid             1,091            1,247  \n  expenses                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  securiti\u2026           1,026            1,054  \n  at fair                                     \n  value                                       \n  Structur\u2026                                   \n  real                  322              390  \n  estate                                      \n  FHLB                   48              164  \n  stock                                       \n  Other                 446              549  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $     30,051    $      30,673  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026       J\u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       9\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \nAverage deposits for the third quarter of 2021\nwere $402.7 billion, an increase of $6.5\nbillion, or 1.6%, compared to the prior\nquarter.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\ntaxonomy that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk\nconversations and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces,\nboth presently and in the future, and the\nCompany\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 59\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate\u2019s adherence to and successful\nimplementation of Truist\u2019s risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany\u2019s compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the risks\nassociated with integrating heritage BB&T and\nheritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive\nLeadership oversee the change management\nprogram, which is designed to ensure key\ndecisions are reviewed and that there is\nappropriate oversight of integration\nactivities.\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk both on its assets and\non its liabilities. Truist actively manages\nits interest rate risk exposure through the\nstrategic repricing of its assets and\nliabilities, taking into account the volumes,\nmaturities, and mix, with the goal of keeping\nnet interest margin as stable as possible.\nTruist primarily uses three methods to measure\nand monitor its interest rate risk: (i)\nsimulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, and projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas are an important assumption in\nthe interest rate risk modeling process.\nTruist applies an average deposit beta (the\nsensitivity of deposit rate changes relative\nto market rate changes) of approximately 50%\nto its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit\naccounts when determining its interest rate\nsensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing\ndeposit accounts include interest checking\naccounts, savings accounts, and money market\naccounts that do not have a contractual\nmaturity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nRate sensitivity increased compared to prior\nperiods, primarily driven by excess liquidity\nand hedging changes partially offset by an\nincrease in the investment securities\nportfolio.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nwould increase interest-bearing funds to\noffset the loss of this advantageous funding\nsource.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of demand deposits and an\nassociated increase in managed rate deposits\nunder various scenarios. For purposes of this\nanalysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta\nof managed rate deposits for the replacement\nof the demand deposits at 100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  20:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resul\u2026                \n  Grad\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assum\u2026                \n  Chan\u2026        at            a                \n  in       Septe\u2026       Decre\u2026                \n  Rates       30,           in                \n  (bps)      2021       Nonin\u2026                \n              (1)       Demand                \n                        Depos\u2026                \n              $20          $40                \n           Billi\u2026       Billi\u2026                \n  Up         4.08  %      3.22  %    2.37  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      3.15         2.52       1.90     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at September 30, 2021 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on\nlonger-term projected changes in asset and\nliability values given potential changes in\ninterest rates. This measure allows Truist to\nanalyze interest rate risk that falls outside\nthe net interest income simulation period. The\nEVE model is a discounted cash flow of the\nportfolio of assets, liabilities, and\nderivative instruments.

Truist hedges\na portion of its AFS securities to reduce\nmark-to-market volatility within AOCI and also\nto increase its overall asset sensitivity\nposition. As of September 30, 2021, the\nCompany had $24.0 billion of pay-fixed swaps\nassociated with this hedging program that are\naccounted for as fair value hedges. In the\nthird quarter of 2021, this hedging program\nreduced net interest income by $17 million.\nTruist also uses derivatives to facilitate\ntransactions on behalf of its clients and as\npart of associated hedging activities. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, Truist had derivative\nfinancial instruments outstanding with\nnotional amounts totaling $329.9 billion, with\nan associated net fair value of $2.4 billion.\nSee \u201cNote 16. Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional disclosures.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 61\nLIBOR in its current form will no longer be\navailable after 2021. For most tenors of U.S.\ndollar LIBOR, the administrator of LIBOR\nextended publication until June 30, 2023.\nTenors used infrequently by Truist, including\none week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR and\nall non-U.S. dollar LIBOR, will cease\npublication at December 31, 2021, based on\nthis guidance. Truist has U.S. dollar LIBOR-\nbased contracts that extend beyond June 30,\n2023. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\nproduction of new U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts\nwill cease before the end of 2021. To prepare\nfor the transition to an alternative reference\nrate, management formed a cross-functional\nproject team to address the LIBOR transition.\nThe project team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index. The\nproject team provides updates to Executive\nLeadership and the Board.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases is under review and certain\ncontracts will need updated provisions for the\ntransition. The Company has plans for impacted\nlines of business to remediate these\ncontracts, train impacted teammates, and\nprovide timely notice to impacted clients.\nCurrent fallback language used for new,\nrenewed, and modified contracts is generally\nconsistent with ARRC recommendations and\nincludes use of \u201chardwired fallback\u201d language,\nwhere appropriate. Truist continues to manage\nthe impact of these contracts and other\nfinancial instruments, systems implications,\nhedging strategies, and related operational\nand market risks on established project plans\nfor business and operational readiness for the\ntransition. Market risks associated with this\nchange are dependent on the alternative\nreference rates available and market\nconditions at transition. In 2020, Truist\nbegan offering SOFR-based lending solutions to\nwholesale and consumer clients and entered\ninto SOFR-based derivative contracts. The\nCompany has actively been using SOFR as a\nreference rate in various loan contracts and\nhas originated approximately $3 billion of\nloans as of September 30, 2021 using this\nalternative reference rate. Truist expects\nSOFR to become a more commonly-used pricing\nbenchmark across the industry and will offer\nadditional SOFR based products during 2021.\nOther alternative reference rates, such as\nemerging credit sensitive rates, will be\nevaluated as additional alternatives for\nLIBOR. For a further discussion of the various\nrisks associated with the potential cessation\nof LIBOR and the transition to alternative\nreference rates, refer to the section titled\n\u201cItem1A. Risk Factors\u201d in the Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$38 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of September 30, 2021.\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, one and ten day\nVaR measures declined from the same period of\nlast year as heightened market volatility\nexperienced during March 2020 aged out of the\n12-month VaR look-back window.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended September 30,\n2021. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities. As of September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, Truist\u2019s liquid asset\nbuffer, as a percent of total assets, was\n24.5% and 20.2%, respectively.\n\nThe LCR rule directs large U.S. banking\norganizations to hold unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets sufficient to withstand\nprojected 30-day total net cash outflows, as\ndefined under the LCR rule. As of January 1,\n2020, Truist is subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist\u2019s average LCR\nwas 114% for the three months ended September\n30, 2021, well above the regulatory minimum of\n100%.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At September 30,\n2021, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nThe ability to raise funding at competitive\nprices is affected by the rating agencies\u2019\nviews of the Parent Company\u2019s and Truist\nBank\u2019s credit quality, liquidity, capital, and\nearnings. Management meets with the rating\nagencies on a regular basis to discuss current\noutlooks. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, Fitch Ratings, S&P Global\nRatings, DBRS Morningstar, and Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service all affirmed their ratings\nand provided updates to their rating outlooks\nfor the Company and the Bank as further\ndetailed below.\n\nOn May 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings affirmed the\nratings of the Parent Company and Truist Bank,\nand revised the rating outlook to \u201cstable\u201d\nfrom \u201cnegative.\u201d The revision to the rating\noutlook reflects the rating agency\u2019s view that\nthe Company\u2019s diverse business model and\nstrategy execution will drive stable earnings\nperformance that supports its credit ratings.\nThe revised rating outlook also reflects\nincreased confidence in a U.S. economic\nrecovery, which reduces the likelihood of the\ndownside scenario that was contemplated when\nFitch Ratings revised the ratings outlook to\n\u201cnegative\u201d in April 2020.\n\nOn May 24, 2021, S&P Global Ratings affirmed\nthe ratings of the Parent Company and Truist\nBank, and revised the rating outlook to\n\u201cpositive\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d, citing the\nstabilization in U.S. economic trends and the\neasing industry risk in the U.S. banking\nsystem. The rating agency also noted that the\npositive outlook reflects the view that, as a\nmerged entity, Truist\u2019s better geographic\ndiversity, increased market position, improved\nearnings power, and higher technology spending\nprovide a sustainable competitive advantage,\nand that the financial and credit positives of\nthe merged entity could outweigh the\noperational risks of integrating two large\nregional banks.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, DBRS Morningstar confirmed\nthe ratings of the Parent Company and Truist\nBank and revised the trend for all ratings to\n\u201cpositive\u201d from \u201cstable,\u201d citing substantial\nprogress to date with the Merger integration\nand the rating agency\u2019s view that the impact\nof the economic fallout from the coronavirus\npandemic on Truist\u2019s asset quality and capital\nwill continue to be manageable.\n\nOn July 12, 2021, Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nupgraded Truist Bank\u2019s long-term subordinated\ndebt rating to A2 from A3, and downgraded\nTruist Bank\u2019s long-term bank deposit rating to\nAa3 from Aa2. The rating actions were driven\nby revisions to the rating agency\u2019s advanced\nloss given failure analysis within its updated\nmethodology published on July 9, 2021.\n\nSee the \u201cLiquidity\u201d section of MD&A in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 for additional\ninformation regarding credit ratings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\nSee \u201cNote 22. Parent Company Financial\nInformation\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Parent Company had 36\nmonths and 43 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n20 months and 22 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nTruist Bank\n\nTruist carefully manages liquidity risk at\nTruist Bank. Truist Bank\u2019s primary source of\nfunding is client deposits. Continued access\nto client deposits is highly dependent on\npublic confidence in the stability of Truist\nBank and its ability to return funds to\nclients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window.

Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, and provide a competitive return\nto shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios,\nwhich include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,\nand Total capital are calculated based on\nregulatory guidance related to the measurement\nof capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nminimums. Management evaluates whether capital\nratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above minimums specified by the FRB for\nthe annual CCAR process.

These\ncapital measures are not necessarily\ncomparable to similar capital measures that\nmay be presented by other companies.\n\nCapital ratios remained strong compared to the\nregulatory requirements for well capitalized\nbanks. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2021,Truist paid $1.8 billion in common stock\ndividends or $1.38 per share, and completed\n$1.1 billion in common share repurchases. The\ndividend and total payout ratios for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 were 41% and\n66%, respectively.

Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations, and related disclosures. The more\ncritical policies include accounting for the\nACL, determining fair value of financial\ninstruments, intangible assets, income taxes,\nand benefit obligations associated with\npension and postretirement benefit plans.\nUnderstanding Truist\u2019s accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations.
