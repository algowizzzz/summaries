All of our directors attended\nthe 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which\nwas conducted virtually due to restrictions on\nin-persongatherings resulting from the\nCOVID-19pandemic. The table below shows\ndirector membership on each of our six\nstanding committees: Audit; Compensation and\nHuman Capital; Executive; Nominating and\nGovernance; Risk; and Technology. The charters\nfor each of these committees is accessible on\nour website at https://ir.truist.com/Board-\nCommittees, but these charters are not\nincorporated into this proxy statement. The\ntable also includes the members of the Trust\nCommittee of our principal banking subsidiary,\nTruist Bank. Each Board member attended more\nthan 75% of the aggregate number of Board\nmeetings, and meetings of the Committees on\nwhich he or she served, during his or her\ntenure in 2020. In this regard, it is worth\nnoting that additional meetings were held in\n2020 as the Board and Committees discharged\ntheir duties of oversight with respect to the\nemerging conditions and consequences of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Our Board members also\nattend Board development sessions in addition\nto other Truist events throughout the year.\nDuring 2020, the full Board of Directors held\n11 meetings. We anticipate that the Board\nstanding committees will perform additional\nduties that are not specifically set out in\ntheir respective charters as may be necessary\nor advisable in order for us to comply with\ncertain laws, regulations or corporate\ngovernance standards.

Working with its independent\ncompensation consultant, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee annually assesses the\ncompetitiveness of Truist\u0092s director\ncompensation program relative to our peers. In\nmaking this assessment, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee reviews (i) the\nindividual pay components of our program\nrelative to the pay components for directors\nat our peers, (ii) the average total\ncompensation of our board members relative to\ndirectors at our peers, and (iii) our\naggregate board compensation as compared to\nour peer group.

Deferrals of\nretainer and meeting fees are fully vested at\nall times and are payable in cash upon\ntermination of the director\u0092s service on the\nBoard. Deferred equity awards are payable in\nTruist shares after termination of a\ndirector\u0092s service on the Board. Stock\nOwnership Guidelines. Truist requires non-\nemployeedirectors to hold or control an amount\nof common stock equal to five times the amount\nof his or her annual cash retainer paid by\nTruist for such director\u0092s services. All non-\nemployeedirectors are expected to meet this\nownership requirement by the later of (i) five\nyears following initial appointment as a\ndirector, or (ii) such period of time as it\nmay take to reach the ownership requirement\nthreshold by holding shares or RSUs granted by\nTruist pursuant to the equity compensation\narrangements for directors.\n                                 \n  26    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance The Board of Directors\nregularly reviews Truist\u0092s corporate\ngovernance program taking into account best\npractices, recent developments and the\nrequirements of applicable laws and\nregulations.\n                                              \n                Key Corporate                 \n                Governance                    \n                Documents                     \n  Please visit                                \n  our                                         \n  website at                                  \n  https://ir.\u2026                                \n  under                                       \n  \u0093Governance\u00a0&                                \n  Responsibil\u2026                                \n  to view our                  \u0095\u2009\u2009Corporate    \n  corporate                    Governance     \n  governance                   Guidelines     \n  documents.                   \u0095\u2009\u2009Articles of  \n  Shareholders                 Incorporation  \n  may also                     and Bylaws     \n  request a                    \u0095\u2009\u2009Charters     \n  copy of any                  for each of    \n  of these                     the Company\u0092s   \n  documents,                   standing       \n  which are                    Board          \n  not                          Committees     \n  incorporated                 \u0095\u2009\u2009Codes of     \n  into this                    Ethics         \n  proxy                        \u0095\u2009\u2009Accounting,  \n  statement,                   Securities     \n  by                           and Legal      \n  contacting                   Violations     \n  our                          Policy         \n  Corporate                    \u0095\u2009\u2009Ethics,      \n  Secretary                    Business       \n  at: \u00a0 Truist                 Practices and  \n  Financial                    Conduct        \n  Corporation                  Committee      \n  Attn:                        Charter        \n  Corporate                                   \n  Secretary                                   \n  214\u00a0N.

In 2020, we amended  \n  our Corporate Governance Guidelines to      \n  expand the responsibilities placed on our   \n  Lead Director in response to feedback we    \n  received from our shareholders.

Our      \n  Board members conduct self-assessments      \n  annually and committee rotation is also     \n  considered                                  \n  on an annual basis. \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u2009Robust Shareholder  \n  Engagement Program: We have a formal        \n  shareholder engagement program through      \n  which we seek feedback on our governance    \n  practices from our largest shareholders.    \n  The feedback we receive is                  \n  communicated directly to our Nominating     \n  and Governance Committee and is considered  \n  in determining whether changes are needed   \n  to our corporate governance practices. For  \n  example, the enhancements made in 2020 to   \n  the responsibilities of our Lead            \n  Director were informed by discussions with  \n  our shareholders in connection with our     \n  annual meeting.                             \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Clawbacks: We make all executive awards   \n  (cash and equity)                           \n  subject to recoupment as determined by the  \n  Compensation and Human Capital Committee.   \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Executive Risk Scorecard: We utilize an   \n  executive risk                              \n  scorecard, which the Compensation and       \n  Human Capital Committee may use to reduce   \n  incentive compensation for negative risk    \n  outcomes.                                   \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Comprehensive Board Development: Our      \n  Board Development                           \n  Program provides a formal framework         \n  designed to support the directors\u0092           \n  performance of their responsibilities as    \n  members of the Board and Board Committees.  \n                                              \n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    27  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance\n                                              \n  Environmental, Social and                   \n  Governance \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u200aCorporate Social             \n  Responsibility/ESG: In 2020, we published   \n  Truist\u0092s first Corporate Social              \n  Responsibility Report, highlighting our     \n  good stewardship of the natural resources   \n  entrusted to us, our                        \n  promotion of our teammates\u0092 and communities\u0092  \n  well-being, and our strong corporate        \n  governance program.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Our Board\nof Directors is committed to maintaining\nobjective, independent oversight of management\nin upholding its responsibilities to our\nshareholders and in carrying out the strategic\nobjectives of the Company. The value we place\non the independence of our directors is\nreflected in our corporate governance\ndocuments, Board Committee Charters, annual\nindependence review of our Board members and\nthe role of our Lead Director. In determining\ndirector independence, our Board considers the\nNew York Stock Exchange\u0092s (\u0093NYSE\u0094) bright-line\nindependence criteria and the standards set\nforth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nConsistent with NYSE rules, our Board of\nDirectors also broadly considers all other\nrelevant facts and circumstances that bear on\nthe materiality of each director\u0092s\nrelationship with Truist, including the\npotential for conflicts of interest, when\ndetermining director independence. In making\nan independence determination, no director\nqualifies as \u0093independent\u0094 unless the Board\naffirmatively determines that the director has\nno material relationship, and has not had such\na relationship within the past three years,\nwith Truist or any of its subsidiaries.\n                                 \n  28    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance\nTo assist it in making\nindependence\ndeterminations, our\nBoard of Directors has\nadopted categorical\nstandards which are\ncontained in our\nCorporate Governance\nGuidelines.

Prior to the resignation becoming\neffective, the Board, through the Nominating\nand Governance Committee, will review any such\nchange and determine whether to accept or\nreject the director\u0092s resignation. SERVICE ON\nOTHER BOARDS A director must advise the\nChairman of the Board and the Chair of the\nNominating and Governance Committee before\naccepting an invitation to serve on another\npublic or private company board. The\nNominating and Governance Committee will\nreview whether such board service may unduly\nimpact the ability of the director to fulfill\nhis or her responsibilities as a director of\nTruist and, if so, shall make a recommendation\nto the Board. A non-employeedirector of Truist\nmay not serve on more than three other public\ncompany boards, and a non-employeedirector of\nTruist who is also the chief executive officer\nof another public company may not serve on\nmore than two public company boards, including\nthe Truist Board. Employee directors of Truist\nmay not serve on more than two public company\nboards, including the Truist Board. In\naddition, if a member of the Audit Committee\ndesires to serve on the audit committees of\nmore than a total of three public companies,\nthe Board must approve such additional service\nbefore the director accepts the additional\nposition. Members of Executive Leadership may\nserve on one public company board, in addition\nto the Truist Board, with the approval of the\nChief Executive Officer or, in the case of the\nChief Executive Officer, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee. BOARD DEVELOPMENT Our\nBoard Development Program provides a formal\nframework designed to support the directors\u0092\nperformance of their responsibilities as\nmembers of the Board and Board Committees. The\nBoard Development Program allows directors to\nsupplement their existing skill sets and stay\ninformed of emerging risks and trends in\nTruist\u0092s business and the broader financial\nservices industry in general. The programs and\ncourses are provided by both in-houseexperts\nand outside consultants on a wide range of\ntopics to enhance the directors\u0092 knowledge in\nareas important in carrying out their\nresponsibilities as directors. Programs and\npresentations of general application are\noffered to the full Board while others are\ntailored to the specific requirements of the\nvarious Board Committees. The directors\u0092\nparticipation is considered by the Nominating\nand Governance Committee in its annual\nevaluation of their performance. The programs\nand courses offered through our development\nprogram are in addition to programs and\ncourses in which our Board members regularly\nparticipate in order to maintain professional\ncredentials, including courses related to\nethics.\n                                 \n  30    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance Newly elected directors\nundergo an extensive director orientation\nprocess. We view the director orientation\nprocess as a means to acquaint newly elected\ndirectors with our businesses and corporate\ngovernance framework, and also to further our\ndirectors\u0092 understanding of our culture and\nthe Board\u0092s role in determining the Company\u0092s\nculture and overseeing management\u0092s assurance\nof corporate integrity. Our Chief Legal\nOfficer and other members of Executive\nLeadership facilitate a detailed Board\norientation session. These sessions review the\nCompany\u0092s culture and values, codes of ethics,\nstrategic objectives and planning, risk\nmanagement matters, compliance programs,\ninternal audit services and our corporate\ngovernance program. Additional topics covered\nin orientation include the Company\u0092s business\nstructure, including regulatory oversight,\nlaws governing directors\u0092 duties and conduct,\nTruist\u0092s securities law policies, and\nliability insurance coverage. Additionally,\nnew directors and rotating directors each\nattend an orientation of the committee(s) on\nwhich they serve, which covers in detail the\noperation and duties of the relevant\ncommittee. BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE SELF-\nASSESSMENT On an annual basis, our Board of\nDirectors evaluates its effectiveness over the\npreceding year. Each director participates in\nthe evaluation process and each committee is\nseparately evaluated. The evaluation process\nis managed by our Nominating and Governance\nCommittee with assistance from our Office of\nthe Corporate Secretary. During our Board\nevaluation process, directors are presented\nwith a written questionnaire designed to\nelicit constructive feedback from each\ndirector about his or her individual service\nand the effectiveness of the Board and each\ncommittee on which the director serves. In\n2020, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nand Lead Director separately called each\ndirector personally after distribution of the\nquestionnaires to solicit concerns or input\nregarding the performance of the Board or its\ncommittees. Responses received from our\ndirectors are discussed with the full Board as\nwell as each standing committee in executive\nsessions. This feedback is used to improve\nBoard and committee practices, procedures and\npolicies and, as appropriate, is discussed\nwith members of Executive Leadership to\nimprove efficiencies and effectiveness.\nSUCCESSION PLANNING AND CHANGES RESULTING FROM\nTHE MERGER Human capital management and talent\ndevelopment is a priority for the Board of\nDirectors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nprovide that the Board of Directors is\nresponsible for ensuring that we have\ndeveloped an Executive Leadership succession\nplan, including procedures for Chief Executive\nOfficer selection in the event of an emergency\nor the retirement of the CEO. This plan is\nreviewed and evaluated by the Board at least\nannually. The Lead Director facilitates the\nBoard\u0092s review and evaluation of our Executive\nLeadership succession plan. As part of the\nplan, our Chairman and CEO makes available his\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential\nsuccessors, along with a review of any\ndevelopment plans of such individuals. CEO and\nChairman Succession Certain key governance\nmatters were agreed upon, and approved by\nshareholders, as part of the merger of equals\nof BB&T and SunTrust to form Truist.

Mr.\u00a0Rogers will become         \n    Chairman of Truist at such time as Mr.\u00a0   \n    King is no longer serving as Executive    \n    Chairman.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    The merger agreement also requires that   \n    an independent Lead Director be in place  \n    during all of these periods.              \n                                              \nEffective contemporaneously with the merger,\nMr. King and Mr. Rogers entered into\nindividual employment agreements with Truist,\nwhich set out clear, limited employment terms,\nfurther reinforcing the idea that the current\nstructure was not meant to address long-term\ngovernance. In particular, pursuant to his\nemployment agreement, Mr. King\u0092s service as\nChairman and CEO runs until September 12,\n2021, and his service as Executive Chairman\ncontinues through March 12, 2022, consistent\nwith the terms of the merger agreement as\ndescribed above. In addition, the term of Mr.\nRoger\u0092s employment agreement runs through\nDecember 6, 2022. These short-term\narrangements were meant to provide equity in\nthe merger to each side and specifically not\nmeant to address long-term governance. For a\nperiod of three years following completion of\nthe merger, or until December 6, 2022, any\nremoval of (or failure to reelect or nominate)\nMr. Rogers or Mr. King from (or to) the\npositions described above, and at the times\nspecifically provided for above, will require\nthe affirmative vote of at least 75% of the\nentire Board. For a period of three years\nfollowing completion of the Merger, or until\nDecember 6, 2022, any determination not to\nnominate Mr. Rogers as a director of the\nCorporation or Truist Bank will require the\naffirmative vote of at least 75% of the entire\nBoard. In addition, any determination not to\nnominate Mr. King as a director of the\nCorporation or Truist Bank for each term of\nservice for directors beginning at any time\nprior to December 31, 2023 will require the\naffirmative vote of at least 75% of the entire\nBoard. In the event that Mr. King is not re-\nelectedor reappointed to the Board during the\ntime in which Mr. King is serving as Chairman\nand Mr. Rogers is re-electedto the Board, Mr.\nRogers would become the Chairman of the Board.\nIn the event that both Mr. King and\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    31  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance Mr. Rogers are not re-\nelectedor reappointed to the Board during the\ntime in which Mr. King is serving as Chairman,\nor in the event that Mr. Rogers is not re-\nelectedor reappointed to the Board during the\ntime in which Mr. Rogers is serving as\nChairman, the Board would appoint a new\nChairman of the Board from its existing\nmembers in accordance with the corporate\ngovernance policies of Truist. In the event\nthat Mr. King or Mr. Rogers is not re-\nelectedto the Board at a time when he is\ndesignated by the merger agreement to serve as\nChief Executive Officer (or in the case of Mr.\nRogers, as President), Mr. King or Mr. Rogers,\nas the case may be, would remain entitled to\nserve in that executive position. Board of\nDirectors Composition and Vacancies Under\nTruist\u0092s bylaws as agreed in the merger, and\napproved by shareholder vote, the Truist Board\nof Directors is comprised of:\n                                   \n    the CEO of BB&T (Kelly King);  \n                                   \n                                              \n    10 additional members of the BB&T board   \n    of directors as \u00a0designated by BB&T; and  \n                                              \n                                        \n    the CEO of SunTrust (Bill Rogers);  \n                                        \n                                              \n    10 additional members of the SunTrust     \n    board of directors as designated by       \n    SunTrust.                                 \n                                              \nThe directors nominated in this proxy\nstatement were selected pursuant to these\nbylaw amendments. In addition, if any vacancy\noccurs during the first three years after the\nclosing of the merger, our revised bylaws\nprovide that no vacancy on the Board may be\nfilled by the Board, unless:\n                                              \n    such individual would be an independent   \n    director;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    in the case of a vacancy created by the   \n    cessation of service of a continuing      \n    SunTrust director, not less than a        \n    majority                                  \n    of the continuing SunTrust\u00a0directors      \n    have approved the appointment or          \n    nomination of the individual to fill      \n    such vacancy; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n    in the case of a vacancy created by the   \n    cessation of service of a continuing      \n    BB&T director, not less than a majority   \n    of the continuing BB&T directors have     \n    approved the appointment or nomination    \n    of the individual to fill such vacancy.   \n                                              \nAny appointment or nomination pursuant to\nthese bylaw provisions shall be made in\naccordance with applicable law and the rules\nof the New York Stock Exchange. Board\nLeadership Structure CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Our Board of Directors\nis led by the Chairman. Under our bylaws, the\nChairman is elected by the Board and presides\nover each Board meeting and performs such\nother duties as may be incident to the office\nof Chairman. Our bylaws and Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines each provide that the\nChairman may also hold the position of Chief\nExecutive Officer. Truist\u0092s Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer is not permitted to serve as\na member of any standing Board Committee,\nother than the Executive Committee, the Risk\nCommittee and the Technology Committee. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that\nwhen the position of Chairman of the Board is\nnot held by an independent director, the Board\nwill appoint an independent Lead Director. It\nis the Board\u0092s current belief that having a\nunified Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nis appropriate and in the best interests of\nTruist and our shareholders. The Board\nbelieves that combining the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer roles at this time provides\nthe following advantages to us:\n                                              \n    our Chief Executive Officer is more       \n    familiar with our current business and    \n    industry than our non-management          \n    directors and is best\u00a0situated to lead\u00a0   \n    discussions on important matters          \n    affecting the business of Truist;         \n                                              \n                                              \n    combining the Chief Executive Officer     \n    and Chairman positions creates a firm     \n    link between management and the Board     \n    and                                       \n    promotes both the development and         \n    implementation of corporate strategy;     \n    and                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    combining the roles of Chief Executive    \n    Officer and Chairman contributes to a     \n    more efficient and effective Board,       \n    promotes                                  \n    unity of\u00a0vision for the Company and       \n    avoids potential conflict among           \n    directors.                                \n                                              \nThe Board is aware of the potential issues\nthat may arise when an insider chairs the\nboard of a company, but believes these are\nmore than offset by existing safeguards, which\ninclude the designation of a strong\nindependent Lead Director with a clearly\ndefined role and authority set forth within\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines and\ndiscussed further below. In addition, our\nBoard regularly meets in executive session\nwith the non-managementdirectors outside the\npresence of management. Further, only our\nindependent directors are involved in meetings\nto discuss succession planning and CEO\ncompensation, where peer benchmarking is\nextensively used.\n                                 \n  32    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance INDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR\nDavid M. Ratcliffe serves as the Board\u0092s Lead\nDirector. The role of the Lead Director is to\nassist the Chairman and the remainder of the\nBoard in assuring effective governance in\noverseeing the direction and management of\nTruist. As part of the merger-related\ncorporate governance changes, the Truist\nbylaws provide that until Mr. Rogers succeeds\nMr. King as Chairman of the Board, the Lead\nDirector will be an independent director\nchosen from among the heritage SunTrust\ndirectors. At the time of such succession, our\nLead Director will be an independent director\nchosen by the Truist Board from among the\nheritage BB&T directors. This Lead Director\nwill serve in that capacity subject to the\nnormal rotation policy for Lead Director\nservice as set forth in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, but for not less than\ntwo years. Our Board believes that the Lead\nDirector serves an important corporate\ngovernance function by providing separate\nleadership for the non-managementand\nindependent directors. In addition to the\nformal list of duties performed by our Lead\nDirector as set forth in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, he also meets with\nregulators, participates in shareholder\nengagement calls and attends meetings with\nsenior management. Our independent Lead\nDirector also presides over meetings of our\nnon-managementdirectors in executive session\nin connection with each Board meeting and at\nsuch other times as deemed necessary or\ndesirable. A more complete description of the\nrole of our Lead Director is included in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines and in the\ndiscussion above under, \u0093Standing Board\nCommittee Membership and Lead Director\nResponsibilities.\u0094 Following our 2020 Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders, our Board of\nDirectors approved changes to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, placing the following\nadditional responsibilities on the role of our\nindependent Lead Director:\n                                              \n    Approve Board agendas and information     \n    sent to the Board in preparation for      \n    Board meetings                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    Authority to call and preside over        \n    meetings of the independent directors     \n                                              \n                                              \n    Approve all Board and committee meeting   \n    schedules                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    Preside over executive sessions of the    \n    non-management directors, which will      \n    occur                                     \n    at each regular Board meeting             \n                                              \nWe believe that these enhancements further\nstrengthen the role of our Lead Director and\nprovide an appropriate balance to the Chairman\nand CEO at Truist. Board Size The terms of our\nmerger provided for an initial Board size of\n22 directors. While the Board annually\nevaluates its size and structure, we believe\nthe Board\u0092s current size provides us with\ncertain advantages. Financial institutions\nface significant regulatory, economic, and\ntechnological pressures. In addition, over the\npast year, we believe the size of our Board\nhas provided us an advantage in providing the\nnecessary focus on integrating our two\nheritage companies and in handling the\nadditional pressures placed on us, and which\nwe expect will continue to be placed on us\nthrough 2021, due to the COVID-19pandemic.\nThese pressures have required substantial time\ncommitments and other demands on our\ndirectors. The size of our Board also is an\nadvantage when evaluating our committee\nstructure and assigning an appropriate number\nof members to each committee in order to\nproperly analyze and respond to increasingly\ncomplex developments, whether regulatory,\neconomic, or otherwise. For instance, our\nBoard size has allowed us to incorporate the\nadditional responsibilities of our Technology\nCommittee, created following the merger. The\ndiversity of viewpoints on each committee also\nallows for more effective challenge to\nproposals from management and directors. In\naddition, the number of independent directors\naids in maintaining the requisite independence\nstandards of the Audit, Compensation and Human\nCapital, and Nominating and Governance\nCommittees. The Board believes that its\ncurrent size and structure is appropriate to\neffectively represent the interests of our\nshareholders. Nominating and Governance\nCommittee Director Nominations The Nominating\nand Governance Committee is responsible for\nidentifying and recommending to the Board\nnominees for election or reelection as\ndirectors. We seek as director candidates\nindividuals who possess good judgment,\nstrength of character, and an independent\nmind, as well as a reputation for integrity\nand the highest personal and professional\nethics in order to most effectively serve the\nlong-term interests of Truist and its\nshareholders. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee considers candidates submitted by\ndirectors and third-party search firms hired\nfor identifying director candidates. The\nNominating and Governance Committee also\nconsiders candidates submitted by\nshareholders, subject to the requirements set\nforth below. As evidenced by the composition\nof our Board, the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee strives to include director\ncandidates who are racially and gender\ndiverse, with skills and characteristics that,\ntaken as a whole, will help ensure a strong\nand effective governing body. The Nominating\nand Governance Committee conducts an extensive\ndue diligence process to review potential\ndirector candidates and their individual\nqualifications, and all such candidates,\nincluding those submitted by shareholders,\nwill be evaluated by the Nominating\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    33  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance and Governance Committee\nusing the director membership criteria\ndescribed below. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee then reports to the Board its\nrecommendations concerning each director\nnominee. The Board considers the Nominating\nand Governance Committee\u0092s recommendations\nwhen appointing directors and selecting\ndirector nominees to be submitted by Truist to\nshareholders for approval at the annual\nmeeting of shareholders. DIRECTOR MEMBERSHIP\nCRITERIA A director candidate is nominated to\nstand for election based on his or her\nprofessional experience, strategic insights,\nrecognized achievement in his or her\nrespective field, an ability to contribute to\nour business, experience in risk management,\nand the willingness to make the commitment of\ntime and effort required of a Truist director\nover an extended period of time. A director\nmust be \u0093financially literate,\u0094 as defined by\nthe Board, and should understand the\nintricacies of a public company. A director\nshould possess good judgment, strength of\ncharacter, and an independent mind, as well as\na reputation for integrity and the highest\npersonal and professional ethics. Other\nfactors are also considered to ensure the\noverall composition of the Truist Board is\nappropriate. An important goal of the Board,\npursued through the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, is to include members with diverse\nbackgrounds, expertise and characteristics\nthat, taken as a whole, will help ensure a\nstrong and effective governing body. The\nNominating and Governance Committee annually\nassesses these factors in the director\nselection and nomination process. DIRECTOR\nCANDIDATES RECOMMENDED BY SHAREHOLDERS The\nBoard of Directors also will consider\nqualified director nominees submitted in\nadvance by shareholders when such\nrecommendations are submitted with the\ninformation set forth in Article II, Section\n10 of the Company\u0092s bylaws and policies\nregarding director nominations.

Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina\n28202. Majority Voting and Director\nResignation Policy Our articles of\nincorporation require each director to be\nelected by the majority of the votes cast at a\nmeeting of shareholders. Under our Director\nResignation Policy, as described in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, any director\nnominee who receives a greater number of votes\n\u0093against\u0094 than votes \u0093for\u0094 such election shall\ntender his or her resignation to the Board.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will\nthen consider all of the relevant facts and\ncircumstances and recommend to the Board\nwhether to accept, reject or otherwise act\nwith respect to such resignation. The Board\nwill act on the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee\u0092s recommendation within 90 days\nfollowing certification of the shareholder\nvote and will publicly disclose its decision\nwithin this 90-daytimeframe. A director\n                                 \n  34    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance whose resignation is\nunder consideration will abstain from\nparticipating in any recommendation or\ndecision regarding that resignation. If a\ndirector\u0092s resignation is not accepted, the\ndirector will continue to serve until the next\nannual meeting of shareholders and until the\ndirector\u0092s successor is elected and qualified,\nor until the director\u0092s earlier resignation or\nremoval. Currently, pursuant to North Carolina\nlaw and our bylaws, an incumbent director who\nis not re-electedremains in office until the\ndirector\u0092s successor is elected and qualified\nor until his or her earlier resignation or\nremoval. Our current Director Resignation\nPolicy addresses this \u0093holdover\u0094 issue by\nrequiring any director who does not receive\nthe requisite affirmative majority of the\nvotes cast for his or her re-electionto tender\nhis or her resignation to the Board as\ndescribed above. Related Person Transactions\nPursuant to our Related Person Transactions\nPolicy, we approve or ratify related person\ntransactions only when the Board, acting\nthrough the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, determines that the related person\ntransaction in question is in, or is not\ninconsistent with, the best interests of\nTruist and its shareholders. The term \u0093related\nperson transaction,\u0094 under the Policy,\ngenerally means a transaction where the amount\ninvolved exceeds $120,000 and in which a\nrelated person has a direct or indirect\nmaterial interest. A \u0093related person\u0094 under\nthe Policy generally means (a) a director,\ndirector nominee or executive officer of\nTruist; (b) a person who is known to be the\nbeneficial owner of more than five percent of\nany class of our common stock; and (c) any\nimmediate family member of any of the\nforegoing persons, which consists of any\nchild, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse,\nsibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-\nlaw, daughter-in-law, brother-in-lawor sister-\nin-lawof the director, executive officer,\nnominee, or more than five percent beneficial\nowner, and any person (other than a tenant or\nemployee) sharing the household of such\ndirector, executive officer, nominee, or more\nthan five percent beneficial owner. To help\nthe Board assess whether a material\nrelationship exists for both independence and\nrelated person transactions purposes, our\nBoard adopted guidance with regard to\ncharitable contributions. Under this guidance,\na related person who serves as an executive\nofficer of a charitable or non-\nprofitorganization that receives a\ncontribution from Truist will not be deemed to\nhave a direct or indirect material interest in\nthe transaction if:\n                                              \n    Within the past three years, the          \n    aggregate amount of all such              \n    contributions during any single fiscal    \n    year of the                               \n    charitable or non-profit organization     \n    did not exceed the greater of $1\u00a0million  \n    or 2% of the charitable or non-profit     \n    organization\u0092s consolidated gross          \n    revenues                                  \n    for that fiscal year; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    The charitable or non-profit              \n    organization is not a family foundation   \n    created by                                \n    the related person or an immediate        \n    family member of the related person.      \n                                              \nIn addition, to monitor charitable\ncontributions provided by Truist, any\ncharitable contribution in excess of $5\nmillion made by Truist to any charitable or\nnon-profitorganization of which a director or\nexecutive officer of Truist serves as a\ndirector, trustee, executive officer, advisory\nboard member or in any similar leadership\ncapacity must be approved by the Nominating\nand Governance Committee, whether or not the\ndirector or executive officer has a direct or\nindirect material interest in the\ncontribution. Further, charitable\ncontributions of $500,000 or more to such\norganizations must be reported at the next\nNominating and Governance Committee meeting. A\nnumber of our directors, members of Executive\nLeadership, including our NEOs, and their\naffiliates utilize certain products and\nservices offered by Truist, including personal\nand corporate banking services and securities\nbrokerage services, in the ordinary course of\nour business. Our Related Person Transactions\nPolicy provides that certain categories of\ntransactions do not need review or approval of\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee. These\ninclude all extensions of credit with related\npersons that are made in the ordinary course\nof business on substantially the same terms,\nincluding interest rates and collateral, as\nthose prevailing at the time for comparable\nloans with persons not related to Truist, and\nthat do not involve more than the normal risk\nof collectability or present other features\nunfavorable to Truist (although pursuant to\nFederal Reserve Board Regulation O, extensions\nof credit to directors, executive officers or\ntheir related interests that exceed $500,000\nin the aggregate must be approved in advance\nby the full Board). These transactions also\ninclude any provision of financial services to\na related person, other than extensions of\ncredit, such as brokerage, banking, insurance,\ninvestment advisory, investment banking or\nasset management services, if the services are\nprovided in the ordinary course of business,\non substantially the same terms as those\nprevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties and comply\nwith applicable law. In addition, in the\nordinary course of business, Truist may use\nthe products or services of organizations of\nwhich one of our directors is an officer or\ndirector. Since January 1, 2020, other than as\ndescribed below, there have been no related\nperson transactions that were required either\nto be approved or ratified under our Related\nPerson Transactions Policy or reported under\nthe SEC\u0092s related person transaction rules. In\n2020, Director Thomas N. Thompson purchased\n$400,000 of depositary shares representing\nfractional interests in various series of\nTruist\u0092s Preferred Stock from an affiliate of\nthe Company serving as an underwriter in the\npublic offering of the depositary shares. Such\ntransactions were conducted in the ordinary\ncourse of business on substantially the same\nterms as those offered to non-\naffiliatedpersons, and were ratified by the\nNominating and Governance Committee in\naccordance with our Policy. Based on\ninformation\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    35  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance contained in separate\nSchedule 13G/A filings with the SEC, each of\nBlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group\nreported that it beneficially owned more than\n5% of the outstanding shares of our common\nstock as of December 31, 2020. During 2020,\nwe, and our affiliates, engaged in\ntransactions in the ordinary course of\nbusiness with BlackRock and Vanguard,\nincluding sales of debt securities of the\nCompany and Truist Bank in public offerings of\nthose securities and valuation services. Such\ntransactions were on substantially the same\nterms as those prevailing at the time for\ncomparable transactions with unrelated third\nparties. Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094) requires our\ndirectors, executive officers and any persons\nwho own beneficially more than 10% of our\ncommon stock to file reports of ownership and\nchanges in ownership with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. To our knowledge, based\nsolely on a review of the reports furnished to\nus and written representations from reporting\npersons that all reportable transactions were\nreported, we believe that during the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2020, our officers,\ndirectors and greater than 10% owners timely\nfiled all reports they were required to file\nunder Section 16(a), with the following\nexceptions:\n                                              \n    Securities identified on Form 3/A, filed  \n    on behalf of director Charles A.

We listen closely to our\nshareholders to understand their views on a\nvariety of topics, including our executive\ncompensation and corporate governance\nprograms, as well as environmental and social,\nor ESG, issues involving the Company. At\nTruist, our shareholder engagement program is\ndesigned to encompass a dialogue with our\nshareholders on several levels, including:\n                                              \n    Periodic telephonic meetings with our     \n    larger institutional shareholders;        \n                                              \n                                              \n    In-person, or virtual, meetings with      \n    institutional shareholder                 \n    representatives as                        \n    requested;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n    Responses to shareholder correspondence;  \n                                              \n                                              \n    Dialogue with shareholder proponents;     \n    and                                       \n                                              \n                                           \n    Engagement with proxy advisory firms.  \n                                           \nOur shareholder engagement program complements\nthe work performed by our Investor Relations\nteam in regularly communicating with our\nshareholders, including through investor\nconferences and meetings, and hosting\nquarterly earnings calls.

At our\n2020 annual meeting, shareholders voted on a\nproposal requesting that our governing\ndocuments be amended to require an independent\nChairman of the Board of Directors. Although\nthe proposal failed, our Board of Directors\nand Executive Leadership considered the\nsupport the proposal garnered and took steps\nto address our shareholders\u0092 concerns in this\narea. Following the 2020 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders, members of our Executive\nLeadership team met with the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee to discuss the voting\nresults from the meeting and consider ways to\nstrengthen the role of the Lead Director and\nexpand his responsibilities. In addition, we\nconsidered the views of several of our\nshareholders, who engaged in discussions with\nus leading up to the 2020 annual meeting and\nexpressed support for greater responsibilities\nfor the Lead Director, in order to better\nserve as an effective counterbalance to the\nrole of Chairman and CEO. In seeking out the\nviews of our shareholders, we also considered\nthe manner in which the Lead Director is\nchosen at the time of Mr. Rogers\u0092 succession\nto Chairman as contemplated in the merger\nagreement. To provide an appropriate balance\nbetween the heritage companies that merged to\nform Truist, our bylaws provide that at the\ntime of such succession, a new independent\nLead Director will be chosen by the Truist\nBoard from among the heritage BB&T directors,\nwithout requiring (as our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines do) that the directors choosing the\nnew Lead Director must be independent. During\nengagement calls in the fall of 2020, we\nspecifically asked our shareholders their\nviews on this provision of our bylaws. The\nshareholders we had discussions with viewed\nthis provision as limited in scope and\nduration and one that did not outweigh the\nother strong corporate governance measures\ntaken by the Company. Based on this feedback\nfrom shareholders, the Board determined that\nno changes were necessary to our bylaws with\nrespect to this provision. Following our\nengagement calls, and after reviewing feedback\nreceived from our Board of Directors, our\nshareholders, and peer practices, the Board of\nDirectors approved changes to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, which place the\nfollowing additional responsibilities on the\nrole of our Lead Director:\n                                              \n    Approve Board agendas and information     \n    sent to the Board in preparation for      \n    Board meetings                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    Authority to call and preside over        \n    meetings of the independent directors     \n                                              \n                                              \n    Approve all Board and Committee meeting   \n    schedules                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    Preside over executive sessions of the    \n    non-management directors, which will      \n    occur                                     \n    at each regular Board meeting             \n                                              \nCommunications with the Board of Directors Any\nshareholder or other interested party may\ncontact the Board of Directors or any\nindividual director(s) by written\ncommunication mailed to:\n                                              \n  Board of Directors c/o Corporate Secretary  \n  Truist Financial Corporation 214 N.

Accordingly,\nmanagement and the Board regularly discuss the\nCompany\u0092s strategy and progress towards\nachieving results against the related\nstrategic objectives and initiatives. These\ninteractions result in Board input that\ninforms management\u0092s updates to the strategic\nplan, which are presented to the Board for\nadoption on an annual basis. The Company\u0092s\nstrategic planning process includes an\nindependent risk assessment to confirm that\nstrategic activities are consistent with the\nBoard-approved risk appetite. The Board\u0092s\ninteractions with management throughout the\nyear include, but are not limited to, the\nformal review and adoption of the updated\nstrategic plan and a mid-yearperformance\nupdate. Information Security/Cybersecurity We\nare committed to protecting client\ninformation, and our Board of Directors and\nExecutive Leadership team devote a significant\namount of time and attention to information\nsecurity / cybersecurity risks. The Risk\nCommittee is responsible for oversight of the\nCompany\u0092s risk management function, involving\napproving and reviewing the Company\u0092s risk\nmanagement framework and policies as well as\noverseeing management\u0092s implementation of\nTruist\u0092s risk management framework and\nsignificant risk policies. Members of the Risk\nCommittee of the Board receive regular reports\nfrom our CRO and Chief Technology Risk Officer\n(CTRO) related to information technology and\ninformation security / cybersecurity risks to\nour Company. The Risk Committee may meet\nthroughout the year with risk management\nadvisors and discuss with Executive Leadership\nany recommendations received. In connection\nwith the merger, the Board created a\nTechnology Committee to, among other matters,\nassist the Board and the Risk Committee in\noversight of the Company\u0092s technology risks.\nThe Technology Committee receives reports from\nmanagement, such as the Chief Information\nOfficer, the CRO, the Chief Information\nSecurity Officer (CISO), the Chief Data\nOfficer, and the CTRO regarding the Company\u0092s\npractices, management, and functioning of\ntechnology operations and information security\n/ cybersecurity risks, and reviews and\ndiscusses the Company\u0092s technology policies,\nstandards and controls. On at least a semi-\nannual basis, the Technology Committee reports\nto the Risk Committee the significant\nactivities undertaken by the Technology\nCommittee involving oversight of technology\nrisks and related policies in support of the\nRisk Committee\u0092s overall responsibility and\noversight of the Company\u0092s risk management\nframework. The CISO provides the Board with\nupdates approximately six times each year on\ninformation security / cybersecurity risk, and\nthe Board annually reviews and approves our\nInformation Security Program and Information\nSecurity Policy. The Technology Management\nCommittee is an internal committee created to\nensure that members of Executive Leadership\noverseeing multiple business units understand\npertinent technology-related topics, including\ninformation security / cybersecurity and\nassociated risks. The Technology Management\nCommittee provides additional oversight of\ninformation security / cybersecurity strategy,\nincluding understanding and prioritizing\ninformation security / cybersecurity\ncapabilities and associated risks. Statement\nof Political Engagement Our Executive\nLeadership team has direct responsibility for\nour political activities, while our Board of\nDirectors periodically reviews the management\nof our overall political strategy, political\ncontributions and lobbying expenses. Truist\nparticipates in policy debates on issues to\nsupport our interests and sponsors employee\npolitical action committees, or PACs, which\nallow teammates to voluntarily pool their\nfinancial resources to support federal and\nstate candidates who support legislation\nimportant to us, and our shareholders, clients\nand communities. All PAC expenditures are a\nmatter of public record and are available for\nreview on the websites of the Federal Election\nCommission and various state election offices.\nCorporate funds are not used to make\ncontributions to political candidates,\npolitical parties, or political committees\norganized for the advancement of a political\ncandidate, including Super PACs. In the wake\nof the attacks on the U.S. Capitol on January\n6, 2021, Truist evaluated its political giving\nphilosophy, including discussions with the\nNominating and Governance Committee, and\ndetermined that it was in its best interests\nto remain engaged and has articulated its\npurpose-driven approach to political\nengagement as follows: Truist has a clear\npurpose\u0097to inspire and build better lives and\ncommunities\u0097and we will endeavor to support\ncandidates and initiatives that advance this\npurpose in ways that unify us.\n                                 \n  42    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 2\u0097Ratification of the Appointment of\nour Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm RESPONSIBILITIES The Audit Committee is\ndirectly responsible for the appointment,\ncompensation, retention and oversight of our\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nTo execute on this responsibility, the Audit\nCommittee engages in a comprehensive annual\nevaluation of the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u0092s qualifications,\nperformance and independence. The Audit\nCommittee has carefully considered the\nselection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n(\u0093PwC\u0094) as the independent registered public\naccounting firm to audit and report on the\nconsolidated financial statements of Truist\nand the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting. SHAREHOLDER\nRATIFICATION Our shareholders are being asked\nto ratify the appointment of PwC for 2021\nbecause we value our shareholders\u0092 views on\nour independent registered public accounting\nfirm and as a matter of good corporate\ngovernance. Representatives of PwC are\nexpected to be present at the Annual Meeting,\nwill have an opportunity to make a statement\nif they so desire and are expected to be\navailable to respond to questions posed by\nshareholders. If shareholders do not ratify\nthe decision of the Audit Committee to\nreappoint PwC as our independent registered\npublic accounting firm for 2021, the Audit\nCommittee will reconsider its decision.\nHowever, in view of the difficulty and expense\ninvolved in changing auditors on short notice,\nshould shareholders not ratify the selection\nof PwC, it is contemplated that the\nappointment of PwC will be permitted to stand\nunless the Audit Committee finds other\ncompelling reasons for making a change.\nDisapproval by the shareholders will likely be\nconsidered a recommendation that the Audit\nCommittee select another external auditor for\nthe following year.

In\n2020, all of the services provided by our\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nwere reviewed and approved by the Audit\nCommittee. Audit Committee Report The Audit\nCommittee of the Board of Directors is\ncurrently composed of nine independent\ndirectors and operates under a charter adopted\nby the Audit Committee on October 27, 2020.\nThe SEC and the NYSE have established\nstandards relating to audit committee\nmembership and functions. With regard to such\nmembership standards, the Board has determined\nthat Jennifer S. Banner, K. David Boyer, Jr.,\nDallas S. Clement, Patrick C. Graney III,\nChristine Sears, Bruce L. Tanner and Steven C.\nVoorhees meet the requirements of an \u0093audit\ncommittee financial expert\u0094 as defined by the\nSEC. The primary duties and responsibilities\nof the Audit Committee are to assist the Board\nof Directors in monitoring: (i) the integrity\nof the financial statements of the Company;\n(ii) compliance by the Company with legal and\nregulatory requirements; (iii) the independent\nregistered public accounting firm\u0092s\nqualifications and independence; (iv) the\nCompany\u0092s internal controls and procedures;\nand (v) the performance of the Company\u0092s\ninternal audit function and the Company\u0092s\nindependent auditors. While the Audit\nCommittee has the duties and responsibilities\nset forth above and those set forth in its\ncharter, our management is responsible for the\ninternal controls and the financial reporting\nprocess, and the independent registered public\naccounting firm is responsible for performing\nan integrated audit of our financial\nstatements and of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting in\naccordance with standards established by the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and\nissuing a report thereon. In the performance\nof its oversight function, the Audit Committee\nhas performed the duties required by its\ncharter, including meeting and holding\ndiscussions with management, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm and the\ninternal auditor, and has reviewed and\ndiscussed the audited consolidated financial\nstatements with management and the independent\nregistered public accounting firm. The Audit\nCommittee has also discussed with the\nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nthe matters required to be discussed by the\napplicable requirements of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board and the SEC. In\naddition, the Audit Committee discussed with\nthe independent registered public accounting\nfirm its views on fraud risks and how it\ndemonstrates its independence. The Audit\nCommittee has received the written disclosures\nand the letters from the independent\nregistered public accounting firm required by\napplicable requirements of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board, as currently in\neffect, regarding the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u0092s communications with\nthe Audit Committee concerning independence,\nand the Audit Committee has discussed with the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nits independence with respect to the Company.\nThe Audit Committee also has considered\nwhether the provision of any non-auditservices\nby the independent registered public\naccounting firm is compatible with maintaining\nthe independence of the auditors. Based upon a\nreview of the reports by, and discussions\nwith, management and the independent\nregistered public accounting firm, and the\nAudit Committee\u0092s review of the\nrepresentations of management and the Report\nof the Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm, the Audit Committee\nrecommended on February 22, 2021 to the Board\nof Directors that the audited financial\nstatements be included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2020,\nfiled with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nSubmitted by the Audit Committee of the Truist\nBoard of Directors as of February 22, 2021:\n                                              \n  Dallas                  Easter A.

The Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee and the Board believe\nthat our executive compensation program, as\ndescribed in the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis, reflects a pay-for-\nperformanceculture at Truist that is rooted in\nour values. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and the Board believe that the\nexecutive compensation program is well\ndesigned and effective in aligning the\ninterests of the executives with both the\nshort-term and long-term interests of our\nshareholders, while minimizing incentives for\nunnecessary and excessive risk taking. In\nmaking a decision on whether to approve our\npay practices for our named executive\nofficers, we ask that you consider the\ndescription of our executive compensation\nprogram provided in the following pages in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis,\u0094 the\ncompensation tables and the accompanying\nnarratives. The Board strongly supports our\nexecutive pay practices and asks shareholders\nto support our executive compensation program\nthrough the following resolution: \u0093Resolved,\nthat the shareholders approve the compensation\npaid to Truist\u0092s named executive officers, as\ndescribed in the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis, the compensation tables and the\nrelated narrative disclosures in the Company\u0092s\n2021 Proxy Statement.\u0094 Your vote on this\nproposal, which is required by Section 14A of\nthe Exchange Act, is \u0093advisory\u0094 and will serve\nas a non-bindingrecommendation to the Board.\nThe Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nwill seriously consider the outcome of this\nvote when determining future executive\ncompensation arrangements.\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    45  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The\nfollowing Compensation Discussion and Analysis\n(\u0093CD&A\u0094) discusses how, for 2020, we\ncompensated our named executive officers,\nwhich include the Chief Executive Officer,\n(\u0093CEO\u0094), and each of the other executive\nofficers named in the 2020 Summary\nCompensation Table (the \u0093Named Executive\nOfficers\u0094 or \u0093NEOs\u0094).

BUSINESS\nHIGHLIGHTS For Truist, 2020 was a year marked\nby several unique challenges. First, following\nthe historic merger between BB&T and SunTrust\nin December 2019, our NEOs and Executive\nLeadership were focused on the enormous task\nof integrating our two heritage companies into\nTruist, which at the merger date was the sixth\nlargest U.S. commercial bank. Notwithstanding\nthe importance of bringing together these two\ninstitutions, the systemic problems caused by\nthe COVID-19pandemic beginning in early 2020,\nrequired attention from our NEOs and Executive\nLeadership throughout the year. In confronting\nthese issues, our NEOs worked extensively\ntogether as a newly combined leadership team\nfrom both heritage companies to forge a common\nresolve in managing adversity, creating\ninnovative solutions and maintaining our\nshared goals and vision of the merger while\nkeeping with Truist\u0092s Purpose, Mission and\nValues. Executing Merger Integration Last year\nwas our first as a newly formed company and\nour Executive Leadership was focused on\nintegrating our two heritage institutions,\nBB&T and SunTrust. In managing this\nintegration, the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee and our new Executive\nLeadership team sought to undertake a \u0093best of\nboth\u0094 approach, selecting the best systems and\nprocesses from each heritage organization, and\nbringing them together in the new Truist\norganization. In doing so, we believe that\nboth our clients and shareholders will\nbenefit.\n                                 \n  46    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis During\n2020, our Executive Leadership team achieved\nthe following accomplishments related to our\n2020 merger integration:\n                                              \n    Achieved annualized fourth quarter cost   \n    savings of $640\u00a0million, or 40% of the    \n    overall $1.6\u00a0billion target.              \n                                              \n                                              \n    Purchased Truist Center, in Charlotte,    \n    North Carolina, our corporate             \n    headquarters building.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n    Introduced a new visual brand identity,   \n    which included launching Truist.com and   \n    the release of social media assets        \n    across                                    \n    all major social platforms.               \n                                              \n                                              \n    Executed key integrations of Truist       \n    Securities, Mortgage, Wealth and          \n    Corporate Functions.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n    Achieved efficiencies and cost savings    \n    through completing retail branch          \n    consolidation, closures and               \n    divestitures.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n    Achieved 50% of 4.8 million net square    \n    feet reduction through consolidation of   \n    real estate.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n    Completed conversion of corporate         \n    headquarters, sports\u00a0& entertainment      \n    properties, and the following brands:     \n    Truist Insurance Holdings, Truist         \n    Foundation, Truist Leadership Institute,  \n    Truist Securities and Truist Ventures.    \n                                              \n                                              \n    Truist is ahead of its in-year 2020 and   \n    3-year target for third party vendor      \n    savings.                                  \n                                              \nWhile merger integration activities are still\nongoing, we are proud of the accomplishments\nof our Executive Leadership team during this\nchallenging period. COVID-19Response and\nConsiderations for Executive Compensation In\naddition to our significant merger integration\ngoals, leadership also needed to take decisive\naction to respond to the pandemic. In March of\n2020, our Executive Leadership team worked to\nidentify and manage the unique risks presented\nto not only our Company, but our communities,\nclients and teammates as well. They identified\nways in which Truist could help those in need\nin our communities and launched Truist Cares\nin March 2020. Truist Cares has donated $50\nmillion to organizations dedicated to\nexpanding, rebuilding, and creating thriving\ncommunities during the pandemic. Executive\nLeadership also believes that teammate morale\nand commitment to our clients are critical to\nour Company\u0092s Purpose, Mission and Values.\nRecognizing the disruption caused by the\npandemic, our Executive Leadership enacted\nsafety measures to help protect those\nteammates whose responsibilities required them\nto physically be in an office or branch\nlocation. At the same time, flexible work from\nhome arrangements were implemented on a scale\nnever attempted before at Truist. For our\nclients, we implemented a number of\ninitiatives to assist those in need, many of\nwhom had businesses that were suffering\neconomically, or lost their jobs due to the\nshutdowns caused by the pandemic. While a more\nfulsome list of the initiatives implemented in\nresponse to the pandemic during 2020 is found\non page 4 of this proxy statement, our\nExecutive Leadership team continued to focus\non building a strong culture and providing a\npositive response by Truist in serving our\nclients and communities. Although the broad\ndisruption caused by the COVID-19pandemic\nimpacted our merger integration process and\nrequired unprecedented response to address the\nimpact on our teammates\u0092 safety and our\nbusiness, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee did not make changes to our annual\nor long-term incentive plans as a result of\nthe pandemic. Throughout 2020, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nreceived updates from management on the\nCompany\u0092s performance and whether forecasts\naligned with plan targets. During 2020, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee did\nconsider making changes in certain targets due\nto the widespread economic downturn resulting\nfrom the pandemic. Ultimately, however, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee chose\nto retain the incentive targets at levels\npreviously established, and adhere to the core\nplan design, which allowed for qualitative\nperformance considerations in determining\ncompensation. The Committee believed this\napproach retained the proper balance between\nshort and long-term incentives for our NEOs.\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    47  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Truist\nPerformance\n*Please see Annex A for a reconciliation from\nGAAP amounts to adjusted amounts.\n\n2020 Key Accomplishments\n                                              \n    Despite the many challenges of 2020, we   \n    remained true to our Purpose, Mission,    \n    and Values and provided strong support    \n    for                                       \n    our communities, clients, and teammates,  \n    including the launch of Truist Cares,     \n    which provided a total of $50\u00a0million in  \n    philanthropic support to aid charities    \n    meeting basic needs, furnishing medical   \n    supplies and addressing financial         \n    hardships.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n    We announced brand conversions for        \n    several business units including Truist   \n    Insurance, Truist Securities, and Truist  \n    Leadership Institute; and launched        \n    Truist Foundation and Truist Ventures.    \n                                              \n                                              \n    We achieved our targeted net cost         \n    savings for 2020.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n    In response to the pandemic, Truist       \n    enabled alternative work strategies by    \n    supplementing network capacity and        \n    securing                                  \n    additional IT equipment and               \n    infrastructure (allowing for a majority   \n    of our teammates to work remotely)        \n                                              \n                                              \n    Truist was a top lender under the         \n    Payroll Protection Program, providing     \n    more than $12 billion in loans to small   \n    businesses.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n    We maintained consistent asset quality,   \n    liquidity and capital ratios in the face  \n    of difficult market conditions, and       \n    achieved our CET1 capital ratio target.   \n                                              \nNew Truist Executive Compensation Program for\n2020 Following the closing of the merger, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nexamined the executive compensation practices\nat both heritage companies and competitive\nmarket pay practices for the new leadership\nteam, with a goal to create a best in class\ncompensation program that supports the new\nTruist organization while staying true to our\ncompensation philosophy and core values.

The merger of two\nsignificant organizations resulting in our\norganization doubling in size required\nrealigning leadership roles, responsibilities\nand base salaries. Following a review of\ncompetitive market data provided by the\nindependent consultant, the Committee approved\nbase salaries for the new leadership team,\nincluding NEOs. Annual Incentive Performance\nAward\u0096 Rewards annual performance goals tied\nto strategic plan The Annual Incentive\nPerformance award was developed to motivate\nand reward financial performance and strategic\ninitiatives that define our success following\nthe merger. The program includes a combination\nof absolute and relative financial performance\nas well as a qualitative assessment of\nperformance on strategic priorities and other\ncritical factors of our success, as evaluated\nby the Committee. Absolute Earnings Per Share\n(EPS) and Relative Return on Average Assets\n(ROAA) were selected to measure growth,\nprofitability and our return on investment.\nThe Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nbelieves these metrics have a meaningful\nbearing on long-term increases in shareholder\nreturns and are valuable barometers of our\nperformance. While the primary focus is on\nprofitability and returns to our shareholders,\nthe Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nalso believes our annual incentive payouts\nshould include a holistic review of our\nperformance that includes results on our\nstrategic priorities, including the merger\nintegration, and an assessment of risk\nmanagement and compliance. Long-Term Incentive\nProgram\u0096 Rewards future performance aligned\nwith our shareholders The long-term incentive\nprogram is intended to provide a significant\nportion of executive pay opportunity based on\nour future performance and value creation to\nour shareholders. Under this program, 65% of\nthe long-term incentive opportunity is at risk\nbased on our performance (40% as performance\nshare units and 25% as a cash long-term\nincentive plan (\u0093LTIP\u0094)), and the remainder is\nprovided through restricted stock units. The\nvalue of the cash LTIP and performance shares\nis based on three-year performance with\nrespect to the following metrics:\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    49  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Once an\nabsolute minimum level of ROATCE is achieved (\n\u00b37%), vesting of the performance share units\nand LTIP cash are based on our ROACE and\nROATCE performance in comparison to our peers.\nThese metrics were selected by the Committee\nto reward metrics viewed as important by our\nshareholders, and motivate strong\nprofitability that ultimately drives favorable\nshareholder returns. Sound Compensation and\nGovernance Practices The Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee believes the new\nTruist executive compensation program\nincorporates strong pay and governance\npractices that reinforce our principles,\nsupport sound risk management and align with\nour shareholders:\n                                              \n     What We Do                               \n

Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nalso considers the results of the shareholder\nadvisory \u0093say-on-pay\u0094vote in its design and\noversight of Truist\u0092s executive compensation\nprogram. In 2020, approximately 94% of the\nCompany\u0092s shareholders approved the executive\ncompensation program for our NEOs. The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nconsidered these results in applying the same\ncompensation principles and adhering to the\ncore plan design, allowing for a balance\nbetween short and long-term incentives. 2020\nPay Program Mix The significant majority of\nour executive pay program is performance-\nbased. Approximately 91% of our CEO\u0092s pay is\nbased on performance and approximately 65% is\nbased on long-term performance.

Section\n3\u0097Executive Compensation Program Pay Decisions\nBase Salary Program Summary: The Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee believes the base\nsalary for each of our NEOs should properly\nreflect the scope of their leadership\nresponsibilities, experience, performance,\nskills and contributions. The Committee\napproved base salaries for 2020 taking into\naccount base salaries for similar roles at\npeer institutions and reflecting the new and\nadditional responsibilities for each of our\nNEOs as a result of the merger. Pay Decisions:\nBase salaries for 2020 for each of our NEOs\nwere set at the levels in the table below\nfollowing the merger:\n                                          \n  Name                      Base\u00a0Salary   \n  Kelly S.

The 2020 base\nsalaries represent increases from 2019, in\nrecognition of enhanced responsibilities for\nexecutives in the new post-merger\norganization, which is double the size of the\nheritage organizations. Annual Incentive\nPerformance Award and Payouts Program Summary:\nThe Annual Incentive Performance Award was\napproved by the new (post-merger) Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee based on its\nreview of market and best practice as well as\ncomparison of the legacy programs at BB&T and\nSunTrust. The Annual Incentive Performance\nAward is a cash incentive that rewards pre-\ndefinedfinancial performance (measured by EPS\nand relative ROAA) as well as a holistic\nassessment of performance on strategic\npriorities. These are metrics that the\nCommittee believes are appropriate measures of\nshort-term performance. The AIP award is based\non the following three components: The\nfinancial performance goals are established\nannually by the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and include an Earnings Per Share\n(EPS) target goal based on our internal\nearnings plan and compares Return on Average\nAssets (ROAA) based on our performance\nrelative to our peers. The Qualitative\nScorecard component is based on the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\u0092s\nassessment of the attainment of key strategic\npriorities based on criteria established by\nthe Committee. While payouts based upon the\nEPS component and the ROAA component are\nindependent from one another, a payout under\nthe qualitative performance component requires\nthe Company to meet threshold performance on\neither the EPS component or the ROAA\ncomponent. Payouts under each component of our\nAnnual Incentive Performance Award can range\nfrom 0% to 200% of the target award\nopportunity and are linearly interpolated for\nachievement between threshold, target, and\nmaximum goals.\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    53  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Our NEOs\nhave a target award opportunity for the annual\nincentive, which represents the amount of\naward received if executives achieve all of\nthe performance goals set by the Committee.\nThese targets were developed based on\ncompetitive benchmarking of market practices.\nThe table below summarizes the target award\nopportunities for 2020, as a percentage of\nbase salary: 2020 Annual Incentive Performance\nAward Target\n                                              \n                            Annual Incentive  \n  Name                     Performance Award  \n                        Opportunity\u00a0(as\u00a0%\u00a0of  \n                                base\u00a0salary)  \n  Kelly S.

The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee also\nconsidered whether adjustments were needed due\nto negative risk outcomes and determined,\nafter its analysis, that no adjustments were\nnecessary for 2020. In summary, the AIP award\npayments to our NEOs for 2020 were as follows:\n                                              \n  Kel\u2026    Willi\u2026    Chri\u2026    Clarke    Daryl  \n  S.\u00a0         H.

For additional detail regarding\nthese adjustments, please refer to Annex A.\n\nQualitative Scorecard Component: The\nqualitative component of the AIP is weighted\n20% and reflects an array of pre-\ndefinedstrategic priorities approved by the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee early\nin 2020 at the same time as financial goals\nwere established. Following the onset of the\nCOVID-19pandemic, the Committee also\ndetermined it would be appropriate to\nincorporate our pandemic response to the\nscorecard as an additional priority. Payouts\nunder this component can only be made if at\nleast one of the financial goals (EPS or ROAA)\nachieves threshold performance. Once that\nlevel of performance is achieved, payouts are\nbased on the Committee\u0092s assessment of\nmanagement\u0092s performance in achieving the pre-\ndefinedstrategic priorities. Several strategic\npriorities and other factors used by the\nCommittee to assess qualitative performance in\n2020 are set forth in the table below. The\ntable also describes certain of the\nsignificant results that informed the\nCommittee\u0092s payout decision. Note that the\nCommittee did not assign particular weights to\nany single category.\n                                 \n  54    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Based on\nits assessment of the significant results\nbelow, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee determined the qualitative component\nwas earned at its maximum amount. In making\nits decision, the Committee recognized the\nstrong achievement of our strategic\npriorities, including the merger integration,\nwhich was accomplished in the midst of the\nchallenges presented by COVID-19.The Committee\nbelieves that the overall AIP payout at target\nfor our executives and other plan\nparticipants, based on maximum payouts for our\ntop-rankedROA and strong results on the\nqualitative scorecard, appropriately reflects\nour results through an unprecedented year.\n                                              \n  CATEGORIES            SIGNIFICANT RESULTS   \n

Awards provided as PSUs and under\nour LTIP program utilize the same metrics\nlinking payouts to relative three-year ROACE\nand ROATCE performance. The Committee chose\nROACE and ROATCE as the performance measures\nfor the long-term incentive awards based on\nthe belief that they provide a balanced view\nof returns generated for shareholders. ROATCE\nis an important focus of our investors and\ncritical in our communication of our\nperformance with shareholders. The inclusion\nof ROACE ensures that we also receive strong\nreturns on the goodwill resulting from our\nmerger. The performance goals and payout range\nare established at the beginning of the cycle\n(i.e., early 2020 for the 2020-2022\nperformance period). LTIP awards have\nhistorically been paid in cash, but at the\ndiscretion of the Committee, may be paid in\nshares of Truist common stock, cash or both.\nDividends are not paid on unvested PSUs or\ncalculated into LTIP payments. The Committee\nalso monitors whether our executive\ncompensation program is consistent with the\nsafety and soundness of the Company and\nconsiders whether our executive compensation\nprogram encourages unnecessary or excessive\nrisk taking. The Committee utilizes an\nexecutive risk scorecard through which\ncompensation may be adjusted, if necessary,\nfor risk balancing purposes. See our\ndisclosure under \u0093Executive Risk\nScorecard/Risk Adjustments\u0094 within this\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis.\n                                 \n  56    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Pay\nDecisions: For 2020, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee granted PSUs and LTIP\nawards with the following features:\n\n2020-2022 PSU and LTIP Awards (Granted in 2020\nand Fully Vest/Payable in 2023) Performance\nPeriod Three years Vesting Requirements and\nForfeiture Three-year cliff vesting through\nMarch 2023, with 100% of the award being\nsubject to reduction or forfeiture if there is\nan aggregate operating loss for the\nperformance period or if a significant\nnegative risk outcome occurs as determined by\nthe Committee. Performance Metrics If the\nabsolute performance goal of an average ROATCE\nof 7% for the performance period is achieved,\nthe award payout for the performance period\nwill then be evaluated against the peer group\nbased upon (1) Truist ROATCE relative to the\npeer group ROATCE and (2) Truist ROACE\nrelative to the peer group ROACE. Each metric\nwill be scored independently, then weighted\nand added together. Payouts will be linearly\ninterpolated for achievement between\nthreshold, target, and maximum goals.

The modifier is\ninterpolated for results between the 25 thand\n75 thpercentiles, and the overall payout,\nincluding the impact of our ROCE and TSR\nperformance, is capped at 125% of target.\nPayout Prior to the merger, the heritage BB&T\nCompensation Committee determined how the\nperformance criteria should be addressed in\nlight of the impact the merger would have on\nthe comparability of our financial results to\npeers. For 2018, ROCE for both Truist\n(formerly BB&T) and its peers was calculated\nover a full-year period. For 2019, ROCE\nperformance relative to our peers was\nannualized as of September 30, 2019, to\nreflect performance prior to the closing of\nthe merger. Due to the timing of the merger,\ntarget level performance was assumed for 2020.\nThe Committee determined that the relative TSR\nmodifier would be based on the full 2018-2020\nperformance period. Based on this approach,\npayouts for the 2018-2020 PSU and LTIP awards\nwere as follows:\n                                              \n  Rel\u2026                                        \n  ROCE    Payo\u2026    Relat\u2026    Adju\u2026    Actual  \n  Per\u2026    as\u00a0%     TSR       for      Payout  \n  and     of       Perfo\u2026    TSR\u00a0     Perce\u2026  \n  Per\u2026    Targ\u2026    (2018\u2026    Perf\u2026            \n  (20\u2026                                        \n  11.\u2026             94th\u00a0                      \n  or               perce\u2026                     \n  the     106.\u2026    (trig\u2026    20%      125%(\u2026  \n  541\u2026             posit\u2026                     \n  per\u2026             TSR\u00a0                       \n                   adjus\u2026                     \n                                              \n(1) Represents Truist\u0092s 2018 and 2019 adjusted\naverage ROCE of 11.81%.

Limited Perquisites Our NEOs\nreceive limited perquisites and other personal\nbenefits that the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee believes are reasonable and\nconsistent with our overall executive\ncompensation program.

Teammate Benefits PENSION PLAN\n                                              \n    We provide the Truist Financial           \n    Corporation Pension Plan, a               \n    tax-qualified defined                     \n    benefit retirement plan for eligible      \n    teammates (the \u0093Pension Plan\u0094). We are      \n    among the few remaining companies that    \n    offer a traditional pension plan for our  \n    teammates. This is a benefit we believe   \n    provides a competitive advantage for      \n    attracting and retaining talent.          \n                                              \n                                              \n    We also provide the Truist Financial      \n    Corporation Non-Qualified Defined         \n    Benefit                                   \n    Plan (the \u0093Excess Plan\u0094), to augment the    \n    benefits payable under the Pension Plan   \n    to the extent that such benefits are      \n    curtailed by application of certain tax   \n    limitations. The Compensation and Human   \n    Capital Committee believes that the       \n    benefits provided by the Excess Plan      \n    ensure that we will maximize the          \n    retention benefits of the Pension Plan.   \n                                              \n                                              \n    The Pension Plan and the Excess Plan are  \n    broad-based benefits, and the NEOs        \n    participate in both plans on the same     \n    basis as                                  \n    other similarly situated teammates.       \n                                              \n                                              \n    The Pension Plan and the Excess Plan      \n    provide retirement benefits based on      \n    length of service and cash compensation   \n    level                                     \n    prior to retirement with benefits         \n    generally increasing substantially as a   \n    participant approaches retirement.        \n                                              \n                                              \n    We believe the retirement benefits        \n    provided by the Pension Plan are          \n    meaningful to all teammates, but          \n    especially to those                       \n    who devote substantial service to         \n    Truist. Four of the five active NEOs      \n    have spent substantially all of their     \n    professional careers at Truist and have   \n    built up significant benefits under the   \n    Pension Plan. For example, Mr.\u00a0King has   \n    48 years of                               \n    service at Truist.                        \n                                              \nMoreover, we view the Pension Plan and the\nExcess Plan as important retention tools for\nthe NEOs and other highly compensated\nteammates. These retirement benefits could not\neasily be replicated upon the teammate\u0092s\ndeparture from Truist prior to retirement. The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nbelieves that while the overall retirement\nbenefits provided to the NEOs are reasonable\nrelative to those provided by its peer group,\nthe Pension Plan and Excess Plan provide us\nwith a competitive advantage in attracting and\nretaining talent in light of the high number\nof companies that have frozen or abandoned\ntraditional pension plans in recent years.\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    59  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis BENEFIT\nPLANS During 2020, we maintained, throughout\nthe COVID-19pandemic, various teammate benefit\nplans that constitute a portion of the total\ncompensation package available to the NEOs and\nall eligible teammates of Truist.

These benefits\nare part of the strong value proposition we\noffer our teammates in furtherance of our\npurpose, and help keep us competitive in\nattracting and retaining teammates. We believe\nthat our teammate benefits are generally on\npar with benefits provided by our peer group\nand consistent with industry standards.\nSection 4\u0097Executive Compensation\nProcess\u0097Decision Inputs and Roles Decision\nMaking Calendar 2020 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nPROCESS \u0096 COMPENSATION AND HUMAN CAPITAL\nCOMMITTEE\n                                              \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Receive risk            \n                    management update on      \n                    risk appetite and events  \n                    that could impact         \n                    incentive compensation \u0095   \n                    Review                    \n                    executive risk            \n                    scorecards for the prior  \n                    year \u0095\u2002\u2009Receive            \n                    reports from the General  \n                    Auditor regarding the     \n                    risk management and       \n                    internal control          \n                    effectiveness \u0095\u2002\u2009Approve   \n                    financial results and     \n                    adjustments for           \n                    incentive plans           \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Determine               \n                    payments/vesting for      \n                    incentive plans with      \n  First\u00a0Quarter     performance periods       \n                    completed the prior year  \n                    (Annual Incentive         \n                    Performance Award, LTIP,  \n                    PSUs and RSUs) \u0095\u2002\u2009Approve  \n                    peer group for the        \n                    current year \u0095\u2002\u2009Set        \n                    financial targets and     \n                    performance measures for  \n                    the current year to       \n                    determine Annual          \n                    Incentive Performance     \n                    Award, LTIP and           \n                    Performance Share Units   \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Set compensation for    \n                    current year \u0096 base        \n                    salary,                   \n                    short term and long term  \n                    incentive targets \u0095\u2002\u2009      \n                    Review                    \n                    tally sheets              \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Review projected        \n                    financial results with    \n  Second\u00a0Quarter    proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive                 \n                    plans                     \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Conduct a\u00a0mid-year\u00a0     \n                    review of                 \n                    current executive risk    \n                    scorecards \u0095\u2002\u2009Review       \n                    projected financial       \n                    results with              \n  Third\u00a0Quarter     proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive plans \u0095\u2002\u2009Review  \n                    of Executive Leadership   \n                    compensation with the     \n                    Compensation Committee\u0092s   \n                    independent compensation  \n                    consultant, Meridian      \n                    Compensation Partners     \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Review projected        \n                    financial results with    \n                    proposed adjustments for  \n  Fourth\u00a0Quarter    incentive                 \n                    plans \u0095\u2002\u2009Conduct annual    \n                    review of director        \n                    compensation              \n                                              \n                                 \n  60    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Peer\nGroup and Competitive Analyses The Committee\nuses a peer group to perform competitive\nassessments of executive compensation as well\nas to measure performance under our short- and\nlong-term incentive plans. The Committee\napproves a group of publicly-traded banks or\nfinancial services holding companies each year\nto serve as the peer group. In evaluating our\npeer group for 2020, the Committee considered\na number of factors, including establishing a\ngroup of appropriately sized peers to better\nalign with our significant growth in asset\nsize, market capitalization and regulatory\ncomplexity following the merger. The Committee\nacknowledged the challenges selecting peer\ncompanies as Truist is among the largest\nregional banks in the United States and there\nare only a few other regional banks meeting\nthe criteria. After significant discussion,\nthe Committee determined that the following\ncompanies would be used for competitive pay\nbenchmarking and to determine the relative\nperformance comparisons in our short- and\nlong-term incentive awards. When this peer\ngroup was approved by the Committee in\nFebruary 2020, Truist was positioned at the\n64th percentile for assets and 59th percentile\nfor market capitalization.\n                                              \n                TRUIST 2020                   \n                PEER GROUP                    \n  \u2756\u2009Bank of                    \u2756\u2009M&T          \n  America                                     \n  \u2756\u2009Citizens\u00a0                  \u2756\u2009PNC          \n  Financial                                   \n  \u2756\u2009Fifth\u00a0                     \u2756\u2009Regions      \n  Third                                       \n  \u2756\u2009JPMorgan                   \u2756\u2009U.S.\u00a0        \n  Chase                        Bancorp        \n  \u2756\u2009KeyCorp                    \u2756\u2009Wells Fargo  \n                                              \nThe compensation structure for Executive\nLeadership, which includes the NEOs,\nemphasizes variable pay based on performance.\nWe generally compare each element of\ncompensation as well as total compensation\nrelative to the peer group. In establishing\ntarget pay opportunities, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee reviews market data\nfrom our peers as well as other financial\nservices firms. The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee establishes pay levels for\neach executive that are appropriate based on\nmarket data as well as other critical factors\nincluding each executive\u0092s specific role,\nperformance, experience, expertise, internal\npay comparisons and relative responsibilities\nof the Executive Leadership team. In addition\nto the external peer group analysis, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee also\nreviews detailed tally sheets for each\nexecutive and compares the total compensation\nfor each member of the Executive Leadership\nteam relative to one another. This practice is\nconsistent with our compensation philosophy of\nrewarding our teammates based upon their level\nof responsibility within the Company.\nRegulatory Considerations in Setting\nCompensation Banking regulators have provided\ninput on and influenced the compensation\npractices and incentive compensation at the\nlargest financial institutions in the United\nStates, focusing on the risks intrinsic to the\ndesign and implementation of compensation\nplans as well as the reasonableness of each\nelement of compensation. While we have focused\nour compensation philosophy on performance-\nbased compensation, regulatory guidance has\ninfluenced past decisions with respect to our\nexecutive compensation programs. The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\ncontinues to assess our pay practices to\nbalance risks with our commitment to link NEO\npay to our performance while maintaining\nexecutive compensation programs that are\nmarket competitive and shareholder aligned.\nRole of Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee administers Truist\u0092s compensation\nprogram for Executive Leadership, including\neach of the NEOs, in a manner consistent with\nour Purpose, Mission, and Values. The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\u0092s\nauthority and responsibilities are set forth\nin its charter and include but are not limited\nto:\n                                              \n    reviewing and approving the compensation  \n    for the Chief Executive Officer, the      \n    remaining NEOs and other members of       \n    Executive Leadership;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n    selecting and approving the performance   \n    metrics and goals for the executive       \n    compensation program and evaluating       \n    performance at the end of each            \n    performance period;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    approving award opportunities for our     \n    Annual Incentive Performance Award,       \n    PSUs, RSUs and LTIP awards;               \n                                              \n                                              \n    reviewing the executive risk scorecard    \n    for Executive Leadership; and             \n                                              \n                                              \n    conducting an annual review of director   \n    compensation.                             \n                                              \nIn making compensation decisions, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee uses\nseveral resources and tools, including the\nservices of the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee\u0092s independent compensation\nconsultant, Meridian Compensation\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    61  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Partners,\nLLC (\u0093Meridian\u0094). The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee also considers summary\nanalyses of total compensation delineating\neach compensation element (\u0093tally sheets\u0094), an\nexecutive risk scorecard provided by our Chief\nRisk Officer, competitive benchmarking, a\nreview of the Company\u0092s internal control\neffectiveness, and other analyses. Performance\nAdjustments The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee retains discretion to make\nadjustments to our performance, as well as the\nreported results from members of our peer\ngroup, for purposes of making performance-\nbased compensation awards.\n                                              \n    Throughout the year, the Compensation     \n    and Human Capital Committee reviews       \n    projected results and items for possible  \n    adjustment. At the beginning of each      \n    year, the Compensation and Human Capital  \n    Committee receives final performance      \n    information for the prior year, and       \n    historically has made adjustments to our  \n    reported results (e.g., net income) to    \n    ensure that the                           \n    applicable compensatory plans fairly      \n    compensate participants for core Truist   \n    performance.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n    The Compensation and Human Capital        \n    Committee may also make adjustments to    \n    the reported performance of peer group    \n    members                                   \n    for awards that measure our performance   \n    relative to the peer group.               \n                                              \n                                              \n    A reconciliation of adjustments that the  \n    Compensation and Human Capital Committee  \n    made for the purposes of certifying 2020  \n    performance is included in Annex A to     \n    this proxy statement.                     \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated, discussions of\n2020 performance for compensation purposes in\nthis proxy statement include these adjustments\nmade by the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee. Role of Management in Compensation\nDecisions The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee periodically receives reports from\nour General Auditor, the head of our internal\naudit function, regarding our internal\ncontrols. The purpose of these reports and\nreview is to allow the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee to evaluate our current risk\nenvironment and internal control positions\nrelevant to incentive compensation, and to\ntake these issues into consideration when\ndetermining incentive compensation. The Chief\nExecutive Officer is also involved in\ncompensation determinations for members of\nExecutive Leadership, other than himself,\nincluding compensation for each of the NEOs,\nand makes recommendations to the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee on base salary and\nthe other compensation elements. We believe\nthat the Chief Executive Officer is in the\nbest position to assess the performance of\nother members of Executive Leadership, and\naccordingly, he plays an important role in the\ncompensation setting process. Ultimately,\nhowever, decisions about individual\ncompensation elements and total compensation\nof all members of Executive Leadership are\nmade by the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee, based primarily on the executive\u0092s\nperformance and our overall performance, with\nconsideration of the business environment in\nwhich the results were achieved. In addition,\nthe compensation of the Chief Risk Officer is\nmade in consultation with the Risk Committee.\nRole of Compensation Consultant The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nengages an independent compensation consultant\nto provide market reference perspective and\nserve as an advisor. The independent\ncompensation consultant serves at the request\nof, and reports directly to, the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee. Further, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee has\nthe sole authority to approve the independent\ncompensation consultant\u0092s fees and other\nretention terms, including the authority to\nlimit the amount of fees the independent\ncompensation consultant may earn from other\nservices provided to Truist. The Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee has retained\nMeridian to act as the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee\u0092s independent compensation\nconsultant. In this capacity, Meridian\nperformed a review of our executive\ncompensation programs, provided peer group\nanalyses, and advised on regulatory\ndevelopments, corporate governance and best\npractice trends. The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee determined that, based on\nits review, Meridian is independent and that\nits engagement did not present any conflicts\nof interest. In making this determination, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee noted\nthat Meridian (a) provides no services to\nTruist other than compensation consulting, (b)\nhas no personal or business relationships with\nmembers of our Board or executive officers,\n(c) does not directly own any shares of Truist\nstock, and (d) retains a written policy\ndesigned to avoid conflicts of interest that\nmay arise. Meridian also determined that it\nwas independent from our management and\nconfirmed this in a written statement provided\nto the Chair of the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee.\n                                 \n  62    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis During\n2020, the compensation consultant provided the\nfollowing services to the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee:\n                                              \n    reviewed our company\u0092s total compensation  \n    philosophy for reasonableness and         \n    appropriateness;                          \n                                              \n                                           \n    reviewed overall compensation levels;  \n                                           \n                                              \n    reviewed our total executive              \n    compensation program relative to peers    \n    and advised the Compensation and Human    \n    Capital                                   \n    Committee of plans or practices that may  \n    be changed to improve effectiveness;      \n                                              \n                                              \n    provided market and peer data and         \n    recommendations on Executive Leadership   \n    compensation;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n    reviewed and advised the Compensation     \n    and Human Capital Committee on the        \n    composition of our peer group;            \n                                              \n                                              \n    advised management and the Compensation   \n    and Human Capital Committee regarding     \n    the implications of the merger on         \n    compensation programs;                    \n                                              \n                                              \n    reviewed public disclosure on             \n    compensation, including the draft         \n    Compensation Discussion and Analysis and  \n    related tables                            \n    and compensation disclosures for our      \n    proxy statement; and                      \n                                              \n                                              \n    advised the Compensation and Human        \n    Capital Committee regarding the           \n    compensation of outside directors.        \n                                              \nIn order for a compensation consultant to\nprovide effective advice, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee expects them to\ninteract with our management from time to\ntime. These interactions generally involve,\namong other things:\n                                              \n    obtaining compensation and benefits       \n    data, as well as other relevant           \n    information that is not available from    \n    public sources;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n    working with management to understand     \n    the scope of the various executive jobs   \n    in order to provide accurate              \n    benchmarking;                             \n    and                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    conferring with management to ensure      \n    advice is grounded in our business        \n    strategy and circumstances.               \n                                              \nThis process enables the compensation\nconsultant to identify any areas where further\nresearch or analysis may be necessary, while\nallowing it to discuss any changes to the\nexecutive compensation program or refine\nrecommendations before finalizing its reports\nto the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee. EXECUTIVE RISK SCORECARD/RISK\nADJUSTMENTS We utilize an executive risk\nscorecard, which the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee may use to adjust, if\nnecessary, the short-term and long-term\nincentive compensation of each member of\nExecutive Leadership (including the NEOs). The\nexecutive risk scorecard:\n                                              \n    allows for evaluation of both corporate   \n    and individual results that can be        \n    compared to stated risk appetites in all  \n    risk                                      \n    categories;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n    presents the positive and negative risk   \n    outcomes that have influenced each risk   \n    category, if necessary, and includes      \n    recommended actions with respect to       \n    significant negative outcomes;            \n                                              \n                                              \n    is used in conjunction with the           \n    recommendations of the Chief Risk         \n    Officer, the CEO and the Compensation     \n    and Human Capital                         \n    Committee\u0092s own insight and evaluation;    \n                                              \n                                              \n    is included as part of our risk review    \n    process in which 100% of each Executive   \n    Leader\u0092s short-term and long-term          \n    compensation for 2020 was subject to      \n    potential adjustment; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    is reviewed by the independent            \n    compensation consultant.                  \n                                              \nThe Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nbelieves that the executive risk scorecard is\nan important element to ensure that incentive\ncompensation at the Executive Leadership level\nis risk-balanced. The use of this risk\nscorecard has been discussed with our\nregulators as an additional way to conform to\nincentive compensation guidance and best\npractices. Section 5\u0097Other Compensation and\nBenefits Policies and Practices In addition to\nthe key components of our executive\ncompensation program described above, other\nsignificant policies, plans and factors\ninfluence executive compensation, including\nthe compensation of the NEOs. These policies\nand practices ensure strong governance of our\nexecutive compensation program and promote\nalignment of our executives\u0092 interests with\nthose of shareholders.\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    63  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nCompensation Practices and Their Impact on\nRisk Management We expect all members of our\nExecutive Leadership team to exhibit the\nhighest levels of ethics and demonstrate best\npractices to discourage unnecessary or\nexcessive risk taking when conducting\nactivities on behalf of Truist. The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nannually considers whether our executive\ncompensation program encourages unnecessary or\nexcessive risk taking. In reviewing the\nprogram for risk, the goal of the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee is to design an\nexecutive compensation program to encourage\nprudent risk management and discourage\ninappropriate risk-taking by granting a\ndiverse portfolio of compensation to our NEOs\nthat is expected to reward the creation of\nshareholder value over time. When determining\nincentive compensation, and consistent with\nregulatory guidance, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee evaluates our current\nrisk environment and internal control\nstructure relevant to incentive compensation\nand reviews an executive risk scorecard and\nother reports. The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee also receives reports from\nour General Auditor, the head of Truist\u0092s\ninternal audit function, regarding the\neffectiveness of our overall system of\ninternal controls. BALANCE BETWEEN SHORT- AND\nLONG-TERM COMPENSATION ELEMENTS The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nbelieves that having market-competitive fixed\nbase salaries discourages inappropriate risk-\ntaking. In addition, executives have a\nsignificant proportion of compensation\nprovided in the form of equity awards, such as\nPSUs and RSUs that have performance and\nvesting features that extend over several\nyears. Additionally, LTIP awards are based on\nour performance over a three-year period,\nencouraging our NEOs to focus on long-term\nperformance, rather than just annual results,\nand further reducing risk-taking that is\nlikely to produce only short-term benefits and\nallowing sufficient time for risk outcomes to\nemerge. USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT\nADJUST FOR RISK To help encourage prudent risk\nmanagement, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee considers the risk profile of the\nprimary compensation elements. Under our\nincentive programs, we use performance metrics\nthat closely correlate to shareholder return.\nSimilarly, our incentive programs include\nmeasures that adjust for risk, including the\nuse of the executive risk scorecard. CLAWBACK\nAND FORFEITURE PROVISIONS Our clawback and\nforfeiture provisions also discourage\nimprudent risk-taking. Our 2012 Incentive\nPlan, which is the plan pursuant to which we\nmake all of our Annual Incentive, PSU, LTIP\nand RSU awards, and related award agreements\ncontain broad language regarding clawbacks and\nmake all awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan\nsubject to recoupment, forfeiture or reduction\nto the extent determined by the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee. Our Board\nbelieves that the current structure of\nTruist\u0092s incentive compensation recoupment\npractices is appropriate, effective, provides\na balanced approach to risk management, and\nproperly aligns the interests of our Executive\nLeadership and shareholders. STOCK OWNERSHIP\nREQUIREMENTS The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee believes that members of\nExecutive Leadership, including the NEOs,\nshould accumulate meaningful equity stakes in\nTruist over time to further align their\neconomic interests with the interests of\nshareholders, thereby promoting our objective\nof increasing shareholder value. We have\nrobust stock ownership requirements to ensure\nthat our executives have significant value\ntied to long-term stock price performance\nwhich discourages a focus on short-term\nresults and imprudent risk-taking. In\naccordance with our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, our CEO is required to own Truist\nstock having a value equal to at least 6x his\nbase salary, while all other members of\nExecutive Leadership are required to own\nTruist stock having a value of at least 3x\ntheir base salary. The Corporate Governance\nGuidelines require the minimum level of\nownership to be met by the later of (i) five\nyears after initially joining Executive\nLeadership, or (ii) such period of time as it\ntakes to reach the ownership requirement by\ncontinuously holding the shares or RSUs\ngranted by Truist pursuant to its equity\ncompensation arrangements. Each member of\nExecutive Leadership currently meets these\nrequirements as applicable to him or her\n(whether by owning the required amount of\nshares or still being within the grace period\nto achieve such ownership level). RESPONSIBLE\nEQUITY GRANT PRACTICES Generally, the timing\nof our regular annual equity awards is\ndetermined months in advance of the actual\ngrants in order to coincide with the regular\nFebruary meetings of the Board and the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee. The\ngrant date is established when the grants and\nall key terms are approved by the Board or the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee, as\nthe case may be. For the 2020 PSU and RSU\nawards, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee used the closing price of our common\nstock on the grant date to determine the\nnumber of PSU and RSU awards. In addition, the\n2012 Incentive Plan includes prohibitions on\nthe repricing of stock options without\nshareholder approval. We are required to\nrecognize the expense of all share-based\nawards (such as PSUs and RSUs) in our income\nstatement over the award\u0092s minimum required\nservice period.\n                                 \n  64    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nPledging/Hedging of Shares Our Code of Ethics\nfor Teammates prohibits all teammates from\nspeculative trading in Truist securities\n(including prohibitions on short-selling and\ntrading put options). Our Securities Trades by\nCompany Personnel Policy prohibits Section 16\nreporting persons, which include directors and\nmembers of Executive Leadership, from engaging\nin hedging transactions (including short\nsales, trading in puts, calls, and other\noptions or derivatives). Teammates who are not\nSection 16 reporting persons are prohibited\nfrom engaging in hedging transactions, other\nthan transactions that hedge against an\nexisting long position in Truist securities if\nthe shares underlying the position are readily\navailable for sale or delivery and the\nexercise or strike price of the hedge is above\nthe then-current market price of the shares.\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit\nthe pledging of Truist shares by directors and\nmembers of Executive Leadership. Currently,\nnone of our directors or Executive Leadership\nmembers hold Truist shares that are subject to\npledges or hedges. Tax Considerations Prior to\nthe implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (\u0093Tax Cuts Act\u0094), our compensation\nphilosophy and policies were intended to\ncomply with Section 162(m) of the Internal\nRevenue Code to the extent the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee determined\nappropriate. Section 162(m) generally\ndisallowed a federal income tax deduction for\ncompensation over $1 million paid for any\nfiscal year to the Chief Executive Officer and\nspecified other executive officers, subject to\ncertain exceptions such as for \u0093performance-\nbased\u0094 compensation. As a result of the Tax\nCuts Act, the Company may no longer take an\nannual deduction for any compensation paid to\nany of its covered employees in excess of $1\nmillion per executive officer. Due to the\ncontinued importance and benefit to the\nCompany and our shareholders of awarding\ncompensation that is structured to properly\nincentivize our executive officers, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nbelieves that it is in our best interests to\nretain flexibility in awarding compensation,\neven if some awards may be non-\ndeductiblecompensation expenses to the\nCompany. Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee Report on Executive Compensation The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee is\ncomposed entirely of non-employeedirectors,\neach of whom has been determined in the\nBoard\u0092s business judgment to be independent\nbased on the categorical standards for\nindependence adopted by the Board, which\ninclude the applicable NYSE independence\nstandards. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee is responsible for oversight and\nreview of our compensation and benefit plans,\nincluding administering our executive\nincentive plans, determining the compensation\nfor the Chief Executive Officer and reviewing\nand approving the compensation for the other\nmembers of Executive Leadership. The\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section\nof this proxy statement is management\u0092s report\non Truist\u0092s executive compensation program\nand, among other things, explains the material\nelements of the compensation paid to the Chief\nExecutive Officer and the other NEOs. The\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee has\nreviewed and discussed the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis section of this proxy\nstatement with management. Based on this\nreview and discussion, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee recommended on\nFebruary 22, 2021 to the Board of Directors\nthat the Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nbe included in this proxy statement and\nincorporated by reference into our Annual\nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2020.

At     \n       the maximum level of performance, the  \n       value of PSUs awarded in 2020 would    \n       be: $4,542,863 for Mr.\u00a0King;           \n       $3,203,302 for Mr.\u00a0Rogers, $1,773,444  \n       for Mr.\u00a0Henson; $1,389,811 for Mr.\u00a0    \n       Starnes; and $1,389,811 for Mr.\u00a0       \n       Bible.

For a\ndiscussion of the valuation methods and\nmaterial assumptions applied in quantifying\nthe present value of the current accrued\nbenefit under each of these plans, as set\nforth in the table above, please refer to Note\n15 \u0093Benefit Plans\u0094 in the \u0093Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\u0094 included\nwith the Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, and filed with\nthe SEC on February 24, 2021. A discussion of\neach of these plans is set forth below. Mr.\nRogers participated in several plans acquired\nfrom SunTrust. Those plans have provisions\nwhich differ from the Truist plans discussed\nbelow. The Company merged the SunTrust\nqualified plan into the Truist qualified plan\nin 2020. Mr. Rogers continues to participate\nin the SunTrust ERISA Excess Plan and the\nSunTrust Banks, Inc. Tier 2 SERP although any\nfuture benefit accruals will come only from\nthe Truist qualified and nonqualified plans.\nTax-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan. The Pension\nPlan is a tax-qualifieddefined benefit pension\nplan for eligible teammates. Most teammates of\nTruist and its subsidiaries who have attained\nage 21 are eligible to participate in the\nPension Plan after completing one year of\nservice. Our contributions to the Pension Plan\nare computed on an actuarial basis. No\nparticipant contributions are permitted. A\nparticipant\u0092s annual normal retirement benefit\nunder the Pension Plan at age 65 is an amount\nequal to 1.0% of the participant\u0092s final\naverage compensation plus 0.5% of the\nparticipant\u0092s final average compensation in\nexcess of Social Security covered\ncompensation, multiplied by the number of\nyears of creditable service completed up to a\nmaximum of 35 years. A participant\u0092s final\naverage compensation is his or her average\nannual cash compensation, including salary,\nwages, overtime, bonuses and incentive\ncompensation, for the five consecutive years\nin the last ten years in which he or she\nreceives compensation that produces the\nhighest average. Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit\nPlan.The Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan is\nan excess benefit plan designed to provide\nsupplemental pension benefits for certain\nhighly compensated teammates, including the\nNEOs, to the extent that their benefits under\nthe Pension Plan are curtailed due to IRS\ncompensation and benefit limitations. Benefits\nunder the Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan\nare included in the table above.\nRetirement.Messrs. King, Rogers, Henson,\nStarnes and Bible meet the requirements for\nretirement under the Pension Plan and the Non-\nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan. Teammates with\nat least 10 years of service who have attained\nage 55 are eligible to retire and begin\nreceiving a reduced pension immediately. If a\nteammate begins pension payments prior to\nnormal retirement age, the payments are\nreduced based on a plan-specified reduction\nschedule. Generally, pension benefits under\neach plan are paid to qualifying participants\nin the form of a life annuity for non-\nmarriedparticipants and a joint and 50%\nsurvivor annuity for married participants.\n2020 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation\n                                              \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                 \u2026     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                 \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                 \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  )              \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  )              \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                 \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         Executive contributions were based   \n         on each NEO\u0092s deferral elections and  \n  (1)    the salaries, Annual Incentive       \n         Performance Award and LTIP payments  \n         received by each NEO in 2020.        \n                                              \n                                              \n         This column represents Truist\u0092s       \n         matching contributions credited to   \n         the accounts of the NEOs during      \n  (2)    2020 in respect of the NEO\u0092s          \n         contributions.

During 2020,\neligible teammates were permitted to defer up\nto 50% of their cash compensation under the\nNon-QualifiedDefined Contribution Plan, with\ncertain participants, including each NEO,\neligible to receive a matching contribution up\nto 6% of his or her compensation. All cash\ncompensation is eligible for deferral unless\nprohibited under Internal Revenue Code Section\n409A. Plan participants may select deemed\ninvestment funds under the Non-\nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan that are\nidentical to the investment funds offered\nunder the 401(k) Plan with the exception that\nno deemed investments in Truist common stock\nare permitted. Participants make an election\nupon entering the Non-QualifiedDefined\nContribution Plan regarding the timing of plan\ndistributions. The two allowable distribution\nelections are distribution upon termination or\ndistribution based on a selected age following\ntermination not to exceed age 65. The Non-\nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan also allows\nfor an in-servicehardship withdrawal based on\nfacts and circumstances that meet IRS\nguidelines. The Non-QualifiedDefined\nContribution Plan also provides participants\nin our incentive compensation plans with an\neffective means of electing to defer, on a\npre-taxbasis, a portion of the payments that\nthey are entitled to receive under such plans.\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change\nof Control The potential payments to the NEOs\npursuant to existing plans and arrangements in\nthe event of their termination or a change of\ncontrol at December 31, 2020 are shown in the\ntable below. Truist has entered into\nemployment agreements with certain members of\nExecutive Leadership, including each of the\nNEOs. Several of the important provisions of\nthese employment agreements are discussed\nbelow, including the non-competition and non-\nsolicitation conditions, which generally are a\nprerequisite to

The actual amounts to be\npaid can only be determined at the time of a\nNEO\u0092s termination of employment. The amounts\nreported above do not include amounts that\nwould be provided to a NEO under plans and\narrangements that are generally available to\nall salaried teammates or amounts reported in\nthe \u00932020 Pension Benefits\u0094 and \u00932020 Non-\nqualifiedDeferred Compensation\u0094 tables. In\nconnection with the merger with SunTrust, Mr.\nKing\u0092s heritage BB&T employment agreement was\namended and restated and the heritage BB&T\nemployment agreements with each of Messrs.\nHenson, Starnes and Bible were amended, in\neach case, effective as of the closing of the\nmerger. In connection with the merger, Mr.\nRogers entered into an employment agreement\nthat became effective as of the closing of the\nmerger. The disclosure below is based on the\nterms of the employment agreements with our\nNEOs as in effect on December 31, 2020. For\npurposes of the employment agreements with the\nheritage BB&T NEOs, the merger with SunTrust\ndid not constitute a change of control, and as\nsuch, these NEOs were not entitled to the\nenhanced or additional severance rights under\nsuch agreements that would otherwise be\nprovided in connection with a termination\nfollowing a change of control. Pursuant to the\nemployment agreement between the Company and\nMr. Rogers, he waived the right to participate\nin the heritage SunTrust executive severance\nplan, including any rights or benefits arising\nupon the change of control of SunTrust. In\nconnection with the merger, our NEOs (other\nthan Mr. King and Mr. Rogers) were awarded a\nsynergy incentive award that will vest and be\npayable upon certain employment terminations,\nas described below. Voluntary Termination or\nRetirement. Upon voluntary termination by a\nNEO, any unvested awards and benefits (that\nare not subject to acceleration due to the\nNEO\u0092s retirement eligibility) would be\nforfeited. Beginning with equity awards\ngranted in 2020, the retirement age required\nfor the award to vest upon voluntary\ntermination or retirement was changed from 55\nto 60 years of age. Messrs. King, Rogers, and\nStarnes are over 60 years of age, have more\nthan 10 years of service with the Company and\nare \u0093retirement eligible.\u0094 Therefore, upon the\nend of their employment with the Company, each\nwould generally be entitled to vesting of\noutstanding unvested equity awards. Messrs.\nHenson and Bible are over 55 years of age,\nhave more than 10 years of service with the\nCompany and are \u0093retirement eligible\u0094 for all\noutstanding equity granted prior to 2020.\nTherefore, upon the end of their employment\nwith the Company, each would generally be\nentitled to vesting of outstanding unvested\nequity awards granted prior to 2020. All\nunvested awards Messrs. Henson and Bible were\ngranted in 2020 would be forfeited. The\nunvested portion of Mr. Bible\u0092s and Mr.\nStarnes\u0092 synergy incentive award will also\nvest upon a retirement after August 1, 2021.\nTermination for Just Cause. If the Company or\nTruist Bank terminates a NEO\u0092s employment for\n\u0093Just Cause,\u0094 the NEO will not have the right\nto receive any compensation or other benefits\nunder the employment agreement for any period\nafter such termination other than compensation\nthat is earned but unpaid, unreimbursed\nexpenses, and accrued and vested benefits.\nPayments Made Upon Death or Disability. In the\nevent of the death or disability, and\nsubsequent termination, of any of our NEOs,\nthe Company and Truist Bank will use their\nbest efforts to accelerate vesting of any\nunvested benefits to which the NEO may be\nentitled under any stock-based or other\nbenefit plan or arrangement to the extent\npermitted by the terms of such plans. If Mr.\nHenson were to separate service as a result of\nhis death prior to December 1, 2021, the\nseverance described below upon a termination\nother than for \u0093Just Cause\u0094 would be paid to\nhis beneficiary or his estate. If Mr. King\nwere to separate service as a result of his\ndeath, his estate would be paid a pro rata\nbonus for the year of termination based on\nactual performance. The Company generally does\nnot terminate teammates as a result of\ndisability. Termination for Other than Just\nCause or Voluntary Termination for Good\nReason. If an NEO\u0092s employment is terminated\neither (i) through voluntary termination by a\nNEO for \u0093Good Reason\u0094 or (ii) by the Company\nor Truist Bank other than for \u0093Just Cause,\u0094 he\nor she will be entitled to receive monthly\npayments of cash compensation (including\nsalary and bonuses (other than any retention\nor integration bonuses)) equal to one-\ntwelfthof the highest annual amount of such\ncompensation over the past three years (or if\nhigher, the three years prior to the\ncompletion of the merger with SunTrust) for\nofficers other than Messrs. King and Rogers, a\npro rata annual bonus for the year of\ntermination based on actual performance (for\nofficers other than Messrs. King and Rogers,\nif the termination occurs prior to January 1,\n2022) and teammate welfare benefits, including\nhealth care and outplacement services, for the\nfull three-year term. While Mr. Henson waived\nthe right to terminate employment for \u0093Good\nReason\u0094 as a result of his transition to a new\nposition following the merger, he may elect to\nterminate for Good Reason during two specified\nwindow periods in 2021. For Messrs. King and\nRogers, the amount of severance benefits due,\nif any, is determined by reference to Mr.\nKing\u0092s and Mr. Rogers\u0092, as applicable, average\nannual cash compensation for the three years\nprior to the year of termination rather than\nby reference to the highest such year of cash\ncompensation. For Mr. Rogers, his severance\nbenefits due will be paid in a lump sum\npayment within 60 days following his\ntermination. In addition, any unvested\nbenefits to which the NEO may be entitled\nunder any stock-based awards, cash long-term\nincentive performance awards or other benefit\nplan or arrangement will vest. In addition,\nupon such a termination, the first installment\nof any synergy incentive award will\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    73  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers vest. The\nreceipt by any of the NEOs of payments and\nother benefits under his or her employment\nagreement is subject to compliance with the\nnonsolicitation provisions of the applicable\nemployment agreement and, in the case of\nMessrs. King and Rogers, a noncompetition\nprovision, as described below. Change of\nControl. The employment agreements with our\nNEOs, other than Messrs. King and Rogers,\nprovide that, if an NEO\u0092s employment is\nterminated by the NEO or the Company for any\nreason (other than for \u0093Just Cause\u0094 or on\naccount of the death of the NEO) within twelve\nmonths after a \u0093Change of Control\u0094 of the\nCompany (as defined in the agreements), the\nNEO will be entitled to receive the\ntermination compensation and the other\nbenefits described under the column titled\n\u0093Change of Control\u0094 in the table above. Mr.\nKing\u0092s employment agreement does not contain\nany special provisions that become applicable\nupon a Change of Control, and Mr. Rogers\u0092\nemployment agreement only provides that, upon\na Change of Control, the term of his agreement\nwill not expire until the second anniversary\nof such event. For the NEOs with agreements\nthat contain Change of Control provisions, the\nCompany\u0092s Board of Directors can determine, in\nits discretion, that a transaction constitutes\na \u0093Merger of Equals,\u0094 even though one or more\nof the above definitions of a \u0093Change of\nControl\u0094 is met, and, upon such determination,\nthe applicable individual will not be entitled\nto terminate his or her employment agreement\nvoluntarily and receive continued salary and\nbenefits unless \u0093Good Reason\u0094 exists. The\nmerger with SunTrust was determined to be a\n\u0093Merger of Equals\u0094 for purposes of these\nagreements. The employment agreements (other\nthan Mr. Rogers\u0092 agreement) provide for\nreductions in payments to the extent necessary\nto avoid exceeding the limits established by\nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.\nPayments in excess of these limits are often\nreferred to as \u0093excess parachute payments,\u0094\nand exceeding the Section 280G limits\ngenerally triggers an excise tax on the\npayments. In the case of Mr. Rogers, a\nreduction would only be imposed if the\nreduction resulted in a greater after-\ntaxbenefit to Mr. Rogers than if such payments\nhad not been reduced. Employment Agreements\nwith NEOs (including Restrictive Covenants).\nThe following discussion is as of December 31,\n2020. We have entered into employment\nagreements with each NEO to secure the\nservices of key talent within the highly\ncompetitive financial services industry, which\nagreements, other than Mr. Roger\u0092s agreement,\nwere amended in connection with the merger\nwith SunTrust. Generally, the employment\nagreements are structured to carefully balance\nthe individual financial goals of the\nexecutives relative to the needs of Truist and\nits shareholders. The employment agreements\nprovide that the NEOs are guaranteed minimum\nannual salaries equal to their current annual\nbase salaries and continued participation in\nincentive compensation plans that Truist or\nTruist Bank may from time to time extend to\nits similarly situated officers (in the case\nof Mr. Rogers, with the terms and conditions\nof any such awards to be no less favorable\nthan those applicable to Mr. King). During the\nterm of the employment agreements, each NEO is\nentitled to participate in and receive, on the\nsame basis as other similarly situated\nofficers of Truist and Truist Bank, pension\nand welfare benefits and other benefits such\nas sick leave, vacation, group disability and\nhealth, life and accident insurance and\nsimilar non-cashcompensation that Truist or\nTruist Bank may from time to time extend to\nits officers, which, in the case of Mr.\nRogers, will generally be those applicable to\nMr. King (and in certain instances, no less\nfavorable than those applicable to him prior\nto the merger) and will include eligibility\nfor supplemental disability benefits\nconsistent with the legacy supplemental\ndisability plan of SunTrust. The employment\nagreements for the NEOs provide that, under\ncertain circumstances upon leaving the\nemployment of Truist and Truist Bank, the\nexecutive may not compete in the banking\nbusiness, directly or indirectly, against the\nCompany, Truist Bank and their affiliates.\nThis prohibition generally precludes the NEO\nfrom working for a direct competitor with a\nbanking presence within the continental United\nStates. Additionally, the employment\nagreements for the NEOs prohibit the executive\nfrom soliciting or assisting in the\nsolicitation of any of our depositors,\ncustomers, or affiliates, or inducing any of\nour teammates to terminate their employment\nwith Truist or its affiliates. To the extent\napplicable, these noncompetition and\nnonsolicitation provisions generally will be\neffective until the one-yearanniversary of the\nNEO\u0092s termination. The noncompetition\nprovisions are not applicable if the NEO\nterminates employment after a \u0093Change of\nControl\u0094 and are also inapplicable upon a\ntermination of an NEO (other than Messrs. King\nand Rogers) without \u0093Just Cause\u0094 or for \u0093Good\nReason\u0094 and following the expiration of the\nemployment agreement. While the employment\nagreements with the heritage BB&T NEOs\noriginally had terms of 36 months that\nautomatically extended monthly by an\nadditional month, effective March 1, 2019, we\nprovided notice to each of these NEOs (other\nthan Mr. King) that the employment agreement\nterm would not be extended. As such, the\nemployment agreement with each heritage BB&T\nNEO (other than Mr. King) is scheduled to\nexpire on March 1, 2022. Mr. King\u0092s amended\nand restated employment agreement provides for\nhis continued service as Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer of the Company and Truist\nBank through September 12, 2021, at which time\nhe will commence service as Executive Chairman\nthrough his scheduled retirement date on March\n12, 2022. The amended agreement provides that,\nfollowing his retirement and through September\n12, 2022, Mr. King will serve as a non-\nemployeeconsultant to Truist and Truist Bank\nand receive a monthly fee equal to one-\ntwelfth(1/12) of the sum of his base salary\nand target annual cash incentive opportunity,\nin each case as in effect immediately prior to\nhis retirement date. If Mr. King\u0092s employment\nis terminated prior to March 12, 2022 under\ncircumstances that entitle him to severance\n(as described above) or if the consulting term\nis terminated by Truist prior to its\nexpiration, he will also receive the\nconsulting fee for the full term in a lump\nsum. Mr. Roger\u0092s employment agreement has a\nterm of three years from the date of\ncompletion of the merger (subject to extension\nin the event of a Change of Control of the\nCompany as described above). During the term,\nhe will serve as President and Chief Operating\nOfficer of the Company and Truist Bank through\nSeptember 12, 2021 and thereafter as Chief\nExecutive Officer of the Company and Truist\nBank. Beginning on March 12, 2022, or the\nearlier date on which Mr. King ceases to serve\nas the Chairman of the Board of the Company or\nTruist Bank, as applicable, Mr. Rogers will\nalso serve as Chairman of such Boards.\n                                 \n  74    |\u00a0\u00a02021 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nPay Ratio Disclosure SEC rules require us to\ndisclose the ratio of the annual total\ncompensation of our CEO, Kelly King, to the\nmedian employee\u0092s (teammate\u0092s) annual total\ncompensation. For 2020, Mr. King\u0092s annual\ntotal compensation was $14,840,939 and the\nmedian teammate\u0092s annual total compensation\nwas $122,047. These amounts include the value\nof certain non-discriminatorybenefits. Based\nupon this information, the ratio of the annual\ntotal compensation of Mr. King to the median\nteammate was 122 to 1. The CEO pay ratio rules\nallow us to use the same median employee for\ncomparison purposes for up to three years.\nSince we last identified our median teammate\nas of December 31, 2017, a new median teammate\nwas selected for 2020. For purposes of\nidentifying our median teammate, we examined\nour teammate population, excluding our CEO, as\nof December 31, 2020. The median teammate was\ndetermined by reviewing wages, tips and other\ncompensation on payroll records for our\nteammate population, as reported to the IRS on\nForm W-2.We calculated the ratio based on\ntotal U.S. teammates of 54,682 as of December\n31, 2020. In addition, as permitted by SEC\nrules, we chose to exclude 34 teammates\nemployed in Canada, given the small number of\nteammates in that jurisdiction, and also\nexcluded 200 teammates who joined Truist as\npart of various insurance-related acquisitions\nduring 2020.

A\nbroker \u0093non-vote\u0094occurs when your broker\nsubmits a proxy for your shares but does not\nindicate a vote for a particular \u0093non-\nroutine\u0094proposal because your broker does not\nhave authority to vote on that proposal and\nhas not received specific voting instructions\nfrom you. Brokers and other nominees who are\nNew York Stock Exchange members are expected\nto have discretionary voting power only for\nProposal 2, the ratification of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent\nauditor, but not for any other proposals. As a\nresult, if you do not provide specific voting\ninstructions to your record holder, New York\nStock Exchange rules will allow the record\nholder to vote only on Proposal 2, and not on\nProposals 1 or 3. Broker non-votes,as well as\nabstentions, will be counted in the number of\nshares represented for purposes of determining\nwhether a quorum is present, but they will not\nbe counted as votes cast for or against any of\nthe proposals, and therefore will not affect\nthe outcome of the vote. Holders of our common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights in\nthe election of directors. A proxy may be\nrevoked by a shareholder at any time before it\nis exercised by filing with the Corporate\nSecretary of Truist an instrument revoking it,\nfiling a duly executed proxy bearing a later\ndate (including a proxy given over the\nInternet or by telephone), or by attending the\nannual meeting and electing to vote using the\nvirtual platform. Even if you plan to attend\nthe virtual annual meeting, you are encouraged\nto vote your shares by proxy.\n                              \n  Delivering Proxy Materials  \n                              \nWe deliver proxy materials primarily through\nthe Internet, in accordance with SEC rules. In\naddition to reducing the amount of paper used\nin producing these materials, this method\nlowers the costs associated with mailing the\nproxy materials to shareholders. Shareholders\nwho own Truist common shares directly and not\nthrough a bank, broker or nominee (\u0093record\nholders\u0094) will have proxy materials or the\nNotice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials delivered directly to their mailing\naddress or electronically if they have\npreviously consented to that delivery method.\nShareholders whose shares are held for them by\nbanks, brokers or other nominees (\u0093beneficial\nholders\u0094) will have the proxy materials or the\nNotice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials forwarded to them by the\nintermediary that holds the shares. If you\nreceived only a Notice of Internet\nAvailability of Proxy Materials by mail, you\nwill not receive a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials unless you request a copy by\nfollowing the instructions on the notice. The\nNotice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials also contains instructions for\naccessing and reviewing the proxy materials\nover the Internet and provides directions for\nsubmitting your vote over the Internet.\n                                 \n  2021 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    79  \n                                 \nVoting and Other Information To reduce the\nexpenses of delivering duplicate proxy\nmaterials to shareholders, we rely on SEC\nrules that permit us to deliver only one set\nof applicable proxy materials to multiple\nshareholders who share an address, unless we\nreceive contrary instructions from any\nshareholder at that address. All shareholders\nsharing an address will continue to receive\nseparate proxy cards based on their registered\nownership of Truist common stock. Any\nshareholder sharing such an address who does\nnot receive an individual proxy statement, our\n2020 Annual Report and our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K,may write or call Broadridge\nInvestor Communication Solutions, Inc., as\nspecified below, and we will promptly deliver\nthe materials at no cost.

For 2020, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee made adjustments to\nTruist\u0092s GAAP net income, as set forth in the\ntables below (\u0093Adjusted Net Income\u0094).\nTypically, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee adjusts Truist\u0092s GAAP net income for\ngains or losses on sales of businesses,\nmerger-related and restructuring charges and\nsimilar non-coreperformance items, on a pre-\ntaxbasis, provided the adjustment is not\nsolely a tax-relateditem. These adjustments\nare made so that participants are compensated\nfor Truist\u0092s core performance and are neither\npenalized nor rewarded for non-corecharges,\nunusual gains, or similar non-coreevents.\nExecutive Leadership also uses these financial\nmeasures in evaluating Truist\u0092s financial\nperformance. To the extent practicable, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee also\nmakes similar adjustments to the reported\nperformance of peer group members for awards\nthat measure Truist\u0092s performance relative to\nthe peer group. The adjustments for 2020\naffect the Annual Incentive Program\u0092s\nperformance metrics, earnings per share and\nreturn on assets, and the three-year average\nROCE and ROTCE for LTIP and PSU purposes.\nTruist derives each of these non-\nGAAPperformance metrics from its Adjusted Net\nIncome, which is a non-GAAPfinancial measure,\nand accordingly, each of these adjusted\nfinancial measures is determined by methods\nother than in accordance with GAAP. The\nadjusted earnings per share and return on\nassets measures are each calculated in the\nsame manner as their GAAP counterparts, except\nthat Adjusted Net Income for the applicable\nperformance metric is substituted for its GAAP\ncounterpart in each calculation.
