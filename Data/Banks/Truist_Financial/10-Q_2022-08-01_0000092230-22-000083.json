losses;\na resurgence of the pandemic, whether due to\nnew variants of the coronavirus or other\nfactors, could reintroduce or prolong these\nnegative impacts and also adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s capital and liquidity position or\ncost of capital, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an\noutflow of deposits, and impair goodwill or\nother assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist

for its products and services in order\nto maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public

value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, and\ninstability in global geopolitical matters or\nvolatility in financial markets could result\nin, among other things, slower deposit or\nasset growth, a deterioration in credit\nquality, or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance, or other services;\n\n\u2022 risks related to originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as a loan\nservicer, including an increase in the scope\nor costs of the services Truist is required to\nperform, without any corresponding increase in\nservicing fees or a

create\nsignificant legal or financial exposure; and\n\n\u2022 widespread outages of operational,\ncommunication, or other systems, whether\ninternal or provided by third parties, natural\nor other

These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. There were\nno significant changes to the Company\u2019s\naccounting policies from those disclosed in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 that could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods.

On the date of\ntransfer, the difference between the par value\nand the fair value of these securities, which\nwas recorded as a loss in AOCI, resulted in a\nnet discount of $ 3.7billion, inclusive of $\n510million of basis adjustment gains from\nterminated fair value hedges attributable to\nthe transferred securities. The discount will\nbe accreted and unrealized loss in AOCI will\nbe amortized, offsetting within interest\nincome over the remaining life of the\nsecurities using the interest method. There\nwere no gains or losses recognized as a result\nof this transfer.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of\ncertain MBS securities issued by FNMA and\nFHLMC that exceeded 10% of shareholders\u2019\nequity are shown in the table below:\n                                              \n                     Jun 30,                  \n                        2022                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars         Amortized            Fair  \n  in                    Cost           Value  \n  millions)                                   \n  FNMA         $      44,022    $     39,503  \n  FHLMC               44,548          39,828  \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             3                                \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n             2                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \nAt June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, noACL\nwas established for AFS or HTM securities.\nSubstantially all of the unrealized losses on\nthe securities portfolio, including non-agency\nMBS, were the result of changes in market\ninterest rates compared to the date the\nsecurities were acquired rather than the\ncredit quality of the issuers or underlying\nloans.

and\n$ 184million and the consumer ALLL increased $\n28million and decreased $ 62million for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2022,\nrespectively. The decreases, with the\nexception of the consumer portfolio for\npurposes of the three months ended June 30,\n2022 which saw a slight increase, reflect a\ncontinued favorable credit environment\ntempered by uncertainty associated with\ninflation, supply chain disruption, rising\nrates, and geopolitical events, partially\noffset by growth in the loan portfolio.\n\nThe RUFC decreased $ 6million and $ 13million\nfor the three and six months ended June 30,\n2022, respectively. The decreases reflect a\ncontinued favorable credit environment.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nUS real GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates, property values, the primary 30-year\nmortgage rate, home price indices, and used\ncar prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the June 30, 2022 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2021. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, each\nforecast scenario reflected a moderate\ndeterioration in certain economic variables\nover the reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod when compared to the prior period. The\nprimary economic forecast shaping the ACL\nestimate at June 30, 2022 included GDP growth\nin the low-single digits and an unemployment\nrate starting in the low-single digits with a\nslight increase towards mid-single digits by\nthe end of the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The June 30,\n2022 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases.

The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird party clients via the TRS contracts.

Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company obtains secured financing and\nletters of credit from the FRB and FHLB. The\nCompany\u2019s letters of credit from the FHLB can\nbe used to secure various client deposits,\nincluding public fund relationships. Excluding\nassets related to nonqualified benefit plans,\nthe majority of the agreements governing the\npledged assets do not permit the other party\nto sell or repledge the collateral.

The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, if unfavorable,\nmay be material to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of June 30,\n2022. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. In addition,\nthe matters underlying this estimate will\nchange from time to time. Estimated losses are\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolve considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived, and seeks damages on a class-wide\nbasis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. On\nApril 8, 2020, the Company filed a motion\nseeking to narrow the scope of this class, and\non May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed motion to\ncompel arbitration of the claims of some of\nthe class members. On February 9, 2021, the\ntrial court denied both motions as premature.\nTruist filed a second renewed motion to compel\narbitration against certain class members on\nJuly 5, 2022. The Company continues to believe\nthat the underlying claims are without merit.\n\nUnited Services Automobile Association v.\nTruist Bank\n\nUSAA filed a lawsuit on July 29, 2022 against\nthe Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nalleging that the Company\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe certain\npatents held by USAA. The complaint seeks\ndamages, including for alleged willful\ninfringement, as well as injunctive and other\nequitable relief.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

The remaining assets are\nmeasured at LOCOM, less costs to sell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

business, the Company enters into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, risk\nparticipations, TRS, and credit default swaps.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At June 30, 2022,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 16 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

TE net\ninterest income for the second quarter of 2022\nwas up $162 million, or 4.9%, compared to the\nearlier quarter due to higher market interest\nrates coupled with well controlled deposit\ncosts, growth in the securities portfolio and\nlower premium amortization. These increases\nwere partially offset by lower purchase\naccounting accretion and lower PPP revenue.\nAverage earning assets increased $20.6\nbillion, or 4.5%, compared to the earlier\nquarter. The increase in average earning\nassets reflects a $13.0 billion, or 10%,\nincrease in average securities, a $6.9\nbillion, or 2.4%, increase in total loans and\nleases, and a $1.0 billion, or 20%, increase\nin average interest earning trading assets.\nAverage deposits increased $27.5 billion, or\n6.9%, and average short term borrowings\nincreased $3.5 billion, or 56%, compared to\nthe earlier quarter, while average long-term\ndebt decreased $5.6 billion, or 15%.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.89%, up one basis\npoint compared to the earlier quarter. The\nyield on the total loan portfolio for the\nsecond quarter of 2022 was 3.91%, down ten\nbasis points compared to the earlier quarter,\nreflecting the impact of lower purchase\naccounting accretion, partially offset by\nhigher market interest rates. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 1.82%, up 35\nbasis points compared to the earlier quarter\nprimarily due to purchases of higher yielding\nsecurities, favorable hedge benefits, and\nlower premium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.09%,\nup five basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter. The average cost of short-term\nborrowings was 1.26%, up 28 basis points\ncompared to the earlier quarter. The average\ncost of long-term debt was 1.75%, up 15 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter. The\nincrease in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $171\nmillion, compared to a benefit of $434 million\nfor the earlier quarter. The earlier quarter\nincluded a reserve release due to the\nimproving credit environment during that\nperiod. Net charge-offs for the second quarter\nof 2022 totaled $159 million compared to $142\nmillion in the earlier quarter. The net\ncharge-off ratio for the current quarter of\n0.22% was up two basis points compared to the\nearlier quarter.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 39\nNoninterest income for the second quarter of\n2022 decreased $157 million, or 6.5%, compared\nto the earlier quarter. Investment banking and\ntrading income decreased $147 million, or 37%,\ndue to lower structured real estate fees,\nlower high-yield bond and equity originations\nfees, lower loan syndications, and lower\nmerger and acquisition fees, partially offset\nby higher trading income due to higher CVA\ngains. Other income decreased $104 million, or\n87%, due to valuation changes from assets held\nfor certain post-retirement benefits, which is\nprimarily offset by lower personnel expense,\nand lower investment income from the Company\u2019s\nSBIC investments. Residential mortgage income\ndecreased $43 million, or 37%, as lower\nproduction income (due to lower margins and\nrefinance volumes resulting from the higher\nrate environment) was partially offset by\nhigher servicing income (due to lower\nprepayments and servicing portfolio\npurchases). These decreases were partially\noffset by a $135 million, or 20%, increase in\ninsurance income due to continued strong\norganic growth and acquisitions.\n\nNoninterest expense for the second quarter of\n2022 was down $431 million, or 11%, compared\nto the earlier quarter. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges decreased $176 million\ndue to lower costs in connection with the\nvoluntary separation and retirement program\nand lower costs associated with exiting\nfacilities. Incremental operating expenses\nrelated to the Merger decreased $73 million,\nprimarily reflected in professional fees and\noutside processing expenses and personnel\nexpense. The current quarter includes a $39\nmillion gain on the redemption of FHLB\nadvances. The prior quarter included $200\nmillion of expense associated with charitable\ncontributions to the Truist Foundation and the\nTruist Charitable Fund (other expense).\nExcluding the aforementioned items and the\namortization of intangibles, adjusted\nnoninterest expense increased $56 million, or\n1.8%, compared to the earlier quarter.\nPersonnel expense decreased $105 million, or\n4.8%, ($74 million on an adjusted basis) due\nto lower other employee benefits as a result\nof the decrease in noninterest income for\npost-retirement benefits and lower incentives,\npartially offset by higher salaries due to\nannual merit increases and higher staffing for\ninsurance (primarily from acquisitions) and\nenterprise technology. Other expense increased\n$73 million on an adjusted basis primarily due\nto increased operational losses and teammate\ntravel expenses. Professional fees and outside\nprocessing expenses were up $42 million on an\nadjusted basis due to increased call center\nstaffing and enterprise technology\ninvestments. Marketing and customer\ndevelopment expense was up $27 million due to\nincreased spend to continue to build and\nstrengthen Truist\u2019s brand.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $372\nmillion for the second quarter of 2022,\ncompared to $415 million for the earlier\nquarter. The effective tax rate for the second\nquarter of 2022 was 19.5%, compared to 20.0%\nfor the earlier quarter. The decrease in the\neffective tax rate for the second quarter of\n2022 was primarily driven by lower pre-tax\nincome.\n\nTruist\u2019s total assets at June 30, 2022 were\n$545.1 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion,\nor 0.7%, compared to December 31, 2021. Total\nloans and leases at June 30, 2022, were $307.3\nbillion, an increase of $13.0 billion, or 4.4%\ncompared with December 31, 2021. The increase\nin loans reflects broad based loan growth\nacross most portfolios primarily in the second\nquarter of 2022. Total deposits at June 30,\n2022 were $424.8 billion, an increase of $8.3\nbillion, or 2.0%, compared to December 31,\n2021.\n\nAsset quality remains excellent, reflecting\nTruist\u2019s prudent risk culture and diverse\nportfolio.\n\nTruist maintained strong capital and liquidity\nlevels. As of June 30, 2022, the CET1 ratio\nwas 9.2% and the average LCR for the second\nquarter of 2022 was 110%. The 20 basis point\ndecline in the CET1 ratio compared to March\n31, 2022 primarily reflects strong loan growth\nand share repurchases. Truist declared common\ndividends of $0.48 per share in the second\nquarter of 2022 and repurchased $250 million\nof common stock, resulting in dividend and\ntotal payout ratios of 44% and 61%\nrespectively.

While integration\nactivities are largely complete, the Board and\nExecutive Leadership oversee the change\nmanagement program, which is designed to\nensure appropriate oversight of application\nand data center decommissioning and residual\nintegration activities, achieved through\nTruist\u2019s risk management process.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist utilizes a tiered\ndeposit beta assumption framework that\naccounts for historically observed behaviors\nof clients and the Company. As interest rates\nrise, the deposit beta assumptions also rise\nto reflect increasing competition among banks\nas well as increased client demand for\ninterest-bearing deposits. Based on the fed\nfunds target range at June 30, 2022 of 1.50%\nto 1.75%, Truist applies an average deposit\nbeta of approximately 35% for the next 50\nbasis point increase in the Federal funds rate\nand approximately 50% for any additional\nincreases. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 50 and 100 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 50\nand 100 basis points for all rate indices.\n\n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nRate sensitivity decreased compared to prior\nperiods, primarily driven by higher starting\nrates and higher deposit betas as rates\nincrease and move into the higher beta tiers.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nmay increase interest-bearing funds to offset\nthe loss of this advantageous funding source.\nAlternatively, the Company may reduce the size\nof its investment portfolio to offset the loss\nof noninterest-bearing demand deposits to\nlimit the impact on the balance sheet\u2019s asset\nsensitivity.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at\n100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  18:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resul\u2026                \n  Grad\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assum\u2026                \n  Chan\u2026        at            a                \n  in         June       Decre\u2026                \n  Rates       30,           in                \n  (bps)      2022       Nonin\u2026                \n              (1)       Demand                \n                        Depos\u2026                \n              $20          $40                \n           Billi\u2026       Billi\u2026                \n  Up         1.68  %      0.97  %    0.25  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      1.65         1.13       0.61     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at June 30, 2022 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nand mortgage banking operations, long-term\ndebt, and other funding sources. Truist has\nutilized derivatives to facilitate\ntransactions on behalf of its clients and as\npart of associated hedging activities. As of\nJune 30, 2022, Truist had derivative financial\ninstruments outstanding with notional amounts\ntotaling $331.7 billion, with an associated\nnet negative fair value of $528 million. See\n\u201cNote 16. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d\nfor additional disclosures.\n\nTo protect against any potential downside in\nrates, Truist added $16 billion of receive\nfixed swaps, which are primarily forward\nstarting. These swaps will begin in 2023 and\n2024 and have laddered maturities that\nprimarily range from 3 to 5 years with an\naverage blended interest rate of 2.85%.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nFor most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the\nadministrator of LIBOR extended publication\nuntil June 30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently\nby Truist, including one week and two month\nU.S. dollar LIBOR and all non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, ceased publication at December 31,\n2021, based on the October 20, 2021\ninteragency Joint Statement on Managing the\nLIBOR transition. To prepare for the\ntransition to an alternative reference rate,\nmanagement formed a cross-functional project\nteam to address the LIBOR transition. The\nproject team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board. As of June\n30, 2022, Truist had outstanding LIBOR-based\ninstruments that mature after June 30, 2023,\nincluding: loan and lease exposures totaling\napproximately $155 billion, notional\nderivative exposure totaling approximately\n$133 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion,\nand preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These\namounts are inclusive of remediated contracts,\nwhich contain adequate fallback language for\nthe transition.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases has largely been reviewed and\ncertain contracts will require amendments to\nsupport the transition away from LIBOR. For\nimpacted lines of business, the Company has\nstarted remediating these contracts to include\nstandardized fallback language, or amending\ncontracts to new reference rates at maturities\nduring 2022. Current fallback language used to\nremediate contracts that mature after June 30,\n2023 is generally consistent with ARRC\nrecommendations and includes use of \u201chardwired\nfallback\u201d language.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 59\nThe progress and approach to remediation will\nvary based on the type of contract and\nexisting language used in the agreement. For\ncommercial lending and general consumer\nlending, a significant number of remaining\nLIBOR contracts will require client outreach\nand remediation. Progress, year to date, has\nbeen focused on maturities earlier than June\n30, 2023 and expanding usage of alternative\nreference rates. Efforts to amend and\nremediate contracts, excluding mortgage and\nstudent loans, that mature post June 30, 2023\n($146 billion) will be accelerated during the\nremainder of 2022. Truist has determined that\nadjustable rate mortgage products ($3.8\nbillion) have consistent and adequate fallback\nlanguage to transition away from LIBOR in line\nwith industry expectations; therefore, these\ncontracts will not require remediation.\nRemediation of student loans ($5.5 billion)\nwill follow pending guidance from the\nDepartment of Education on the replacement\nrate for certain student loans and recent\nguidance from the CFPB to allow transition to\n\u201ccomparable rates,\u201d including SOFR or Prime in\nthe private student loan portfolio, where\nLIBOR is used directly. Certain derivatives\nwithout a clearly defined or practicable\nreplacement benchmark rate will use the recent\nFederal legislation to replace LIBOR with a\nSOFR-based rate that will be established by\nFRB rulemaking. This legislation will also\nprovide additional administrative benefit for\na small portion of the commercial and consumer\nlending portfolios where contracts do not\ncontain fallback language and have not yet\nbeen remediated.\n\nTraining has been provided for impacted\nteammates and will continue during 2022.\nTruist will continue to provide timely notices\nand information to impacted clients about the\ntransition during 2022 and the first half of\n2023. Truist continues to manage the impact of\nthese contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and related operational and market\nrisks on established project plans for\nbusiness and operational readiness to support\nthe transition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate for all product offerings,\nexcept on a limited basis, as permissible.\nMarket risks associated with the transition to\nalternative reference rates are dependent on\nmarket conditions as loans are transitioned to\nalternative reference rates during 2022 and\nearly 2023. The Company is actively using SOFR\nas a reference rate and has originated\napproximately $45 billion of loans, issued\n$5.9 billion of long-term debt, and has $84\nbillion in notional derivative exposure using\nthis alternative reference rate as of June 30,\n2022. Alternatives, such as SOFR, may react\ndifferently from LIBOR in times of economic\nstress. Truist expects SOFR to become a more\ncommonly-used pricing benchmark across the\nindustry and will continue to offer additional\nSOFR based products during 2022. Additional\nalternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg\nShort Term Bank Yield will be supported based\non market demand. Other emerging credit\nsensitive rates will be evaluated as\nadditional alternatives for LIBOR based on\nmarket developments. For a further discussion\nof the various risks associated with the\npotential cessation of LIBOR and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates,\nrefer to the section titled \u201cItem1A. Risk\nFactors\u201d in the Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$28 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of June 30, 2022.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths and six months ended June 30, 2022 and\n2021. Average one and ten-day VaR measures for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2022 increased\nfrom the same period of last year, primarily\ndriven by higher market volatility over the\npast quarter. Average one and ten-day VaR\nmeasures for the six months ended June 30,\n2022 were lower than last year as heightened\nmarket volatility experienced during March\n2020 was used for measuring VaR until March\n2021.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 61\nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, VaR\nmeasures briefly increased in the first\nquarter of 2022 due to the increase in market\nvolatility that normalized towards the end of\nthe quarter. There were no Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions during the twelve\nmonths ended June 30, 2022. The total number\nof Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nover the preceding twelve months is used to\ndetermine the multiplication factor for the\nVaR-based capital requirement under the Market\nRisk Rule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other critical teammates to follow in the\nevent of a liquidity contraction or in\nanticipation of such an event. The plan\naddresses authority for activation and\ndecision making, liquidity options, and the\nresponsibilities of key departments in the\nevent of a liquidity contraction.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $85.0 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 110% for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2022.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At June 30,\n2022, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window.

FHLB unused borrowing capacity was $41.4\nbillion at June 30, 2022, down from $49.2\nbillion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to\nincreases in short-term borrowings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Parent Company had 34\nmonths and 35 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n19 months and 19 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings.\n\nThe credit ratings and outlooks of Truist and\nTruist Bank are unchanged from those presented\nin the Company\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital targets, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented stress capital\nratio minimum targets to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above minimums specified by the FRB for\nthe annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed\nminimum targets prompt a review of the planned\ncapital actions included in Truist\u2019s capital\nplan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB of 2.5% applicable to\nTruist as of June 30, 2022.

These measures are useful for\nevaluating the performance of a business\nconsistently, whether acquired or developed\ninternally. Truist\u2019s management uses these\nmeasures to assess the quality of capital and\nreturns relative to balance sheet risk. These\ncapital measures are not necessarily\ncomparable to similar capital measures that\nmay be presented by other companies.\n\nCapital ratios remained strong compared to the\nregulatory requirements for well capitalized\nbanks. Truist declared common dividends of\n$0.48 per share during the second quarter of\n2022 and repurchased $250 million of common\nstock. The dividend and total payout ratios\nfor the second quarter of 2022 were 44% and\n61%, respectively.\n\nTruist completed the 2022 CCAR process and\nreceived the preliminary stress capital buffer\nrequirement of 2.5% for the period October 1,\n2022 to September 30, 2023. Truist had the\nsecond-lowest CET1 erosion and loan loss rate\namong its peers under the severely adverse\nstress scenario. By August 31, 2022, the\nFederal Reserve will provide Truist with its\nfinal stress capital buffer requirement. In\nJuly 2022, the Board of Directors approved an\nincrease in the quarterly dividend of 8% to\n$0.52 beginning in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nTruist CET1 ratio was 9.2% as of June 30,\n2022.
