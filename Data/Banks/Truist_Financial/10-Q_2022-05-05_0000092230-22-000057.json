and results of operations,\nincluding through increased expenses, reduced\nfee income and net interest margin, decreased\ndemand for certain types of loans, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses;\na resurgence of the pandemic, whether due to\nnew variants of the coronavirus or other\nfactors, could reintroduce or prolong these\nnegative impacts and also adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s capital and liquidity position or\ncost of capital, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an\noutflow of deposits, and impair goodwill or\nother assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist

for its products and services in order\nto maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public

stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than

or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance, or other services;\n\n\u2022 risks related to originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as a loan\nservicer, including an increase in the scope\nor costs of the services Truist is required to\nperform, without any corresponding increase in\nservicing fees or a breach of Truist\u2019s\nobligations as

exposure; and\n\n\u2022 widespread outages of operational,\ncommunication, or other systems, whether\ninternal or provided by third parties, natural\nor other disasters (including acts of\nterrorism and pandemics), and the effects of\nclimate change, including physical risks, such\nas more frequent and intense weather events,\nand risks related to the transition to a lower\ncarbon economy, such

These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. There were\nno significant changes to the Company\u2019s\naccounting policies from those disclosed in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 that could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New

On the date of\ntransfer, the difference between the par value\nand the fair value of these securities, which\nwas recorded as a loss in AOCI, resulted in a\nnet discount of $ 3.7billion, inclusive of $\n510million of basis adjustment gains from\nterminated fair value hedges attributable to\nthe transferred securities. The discount will\nbe accreted and unrealized loss in AOCI will\nbe amortized, offsetting within interest\nincome over the remaining life of the\nsecurities using the interest method. There\nwere no gains or losses recognized as a result\nof this transfer.\n\nCertain MBS securities issued by FNMA and\nFHLMC exceeded 10% of shareholders\u2019 equity at\nMarch 31, 2022.

The\ndecrease reflects a continued favorable credit\nenvironment tempered by uncertainty associated\nwith inflation, supply chain disruption,\nrising rates, and geopolitical events.\n\nThe RUFC decreased $ 7million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. The decrease\nreflects a continued favorable credit\nenvironment.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. These macro-economic\nforecasts include a number of key economic\nvariables utilized in loss forecasting that\ninclude, but are not limited to, unemployment\ntrends, US real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nrental rates, property values, the primary\n30-year mortgage rate, home price indices, and\nused car prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the March 31, 2022 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2021. The primary\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nMarch 31, 2022 included GDP growth in the mid-\nsingle digits followed by a decline to the\nlow-single digits through the end of 2022 and\nan unemployment rate starting in the low-\nsingle digits with improvement through the end\nof the reasonable and supportable period.\n\n16 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The March 31,\n2022 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases.

The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, if unfavorable,\nmay be material to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of March 31,\n2022. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. In addition,\nthe matters underlying this estimate will\nchange from time to time. Estimated losses are\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolve considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of a certain\nlegal proceeding in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived, and seeks damages on a class-wide\nbasis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. On\nApril 8, 2020, the Company filed a motion\nseeking to narrow the scope of this class, and\non May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed motion to\ncompel arbitration of the claims of some of\nthe class members. On February 9, 2021, the\ntrial court denied both motions as premature\nbut held that the issues could be raised again\nafter the conclusion of discovery, which is\ncurrently underway. The Company believes that\nthe claims are without merit.\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

investment\nbanking business, the Company enters into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, risk\nparticipations, TRS, and credit default swaps.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At March 31, 2022,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 16 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators.

Our\nfinancial results for the first quarter of\n2022 were solid, though underlying results\nwere mixed in light of market volatility and\ngeopolitical uncertainty. The continued\nfavorable credit environment also led to a\nstrong credit performance and a benefit from\nthe provision for credit losses. Revenues were\nlower as a result of a challenging environment\nfor investment banking and mortgage, but we\nremain confident in our outlook given\nexpectations for higher interest rates, our\ndiverse business model, and continued expense\ndiscipline. At the same time, we acknowledge\nthe increasing uncertainty presented by a\nrange of geopolitical and economic risks. See\nbelow for further updates on our final\nintegration and ESG efforts and a more\ndetailed discussion of our first quarter\nfinancial performance.\n                                              \n  Merger Integration                          \n                                              \nTruist completed our largest conversion event\nduring the first quarter of 2022,\ntransitioning nearly seven million clients to\nthe Truist ecosystem and rebranding more than\n6,000 signs at branches, ATMs, and other\nlocations. We now operate officially as one\nbrand and one bank to our clients. This\naccomplishment was possible because of the\nexpertise, purposeful commitment, and hard\nwork of thousands of teammates. We remain\nguided by our purpose as we continue\nsupporting our clients through the transition\nand look forward to shifting our focus to\nexecutional excellence and purposeful growth\nthroughout this year.\n                                              \n  ESG                                         \n                                              \nEnvironmental\n\n\u2022 Truist has joined the Partnership for Carbon\nAccounting Financials, and set 2030 goals to\nreduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 35%\neach, and to reduce water consumption by 25%,\nrelative to 2019.\n\n\u2022 We announced our goal to achieve net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050, supporting\nour clients\u2019 transition to a low-carbon\neconomy.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 37\nSocial\n\n\u2022 Truist continued to be ahead of schedule\nwith regard to our $60 billion Community\nBenefits Plan commitment.\n\n\u2022 In January 2022, Truist announced Truist One\nBanking, a first-of-its-kind approach to the\nchecking account experience, designed to\naddress clients\u2019 direct feedback.

In addition,\nTruist will offer an alternative checking\naccount product created for clients who are\nnew to credit and want simplicity and control\nwithout overdraft fees. It will help clients\navoid high fees from check-cashing and payday\nlenders, bring many more households into\nmainstream banking, and create a pathway to\nupgrade to a Truist One checking account.\n\n\u2022 In March 2022, Truist issued its first\nSocial Bond Impact Report, which details the\ninvestments made from the bond proceeds and\nunderscores the Company's commitment to\nadvancing its ESG goals.\n\n\u2022 In March 2022, Truist partnered with Connect\nHumanity to provide internet connectivity to\nhistorically marginalized communities.\n\nGovernance\n\n\u2022 Truist made several leadership changes\nduring 2022 as we continued to execute on the\nstrategy first agreed upon in the Merger.\nEffective March 12, 2022, William H.

Wilson\nassumes these responsibilities from Brant J.\nStandridge, who left Truist to pursue a new\nopportunity.\n\n\u2022 In January 2022, Truist appointed Denise M.\nDeMaio as Chief Audit Officer, effective\nFebruary 28, 2022. Denise joined the Executive\nLeadership team, leading Truist\u2019s internal\naudit function, and providing counsel to\nsenior management on emerging risk trends from\nthe vantage points of governance, processes,\ntechnologies and reporting.\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet income available to common shareholders\nfor the first quarter of 2022 of $1.3 billion\nwas relatively stable compared with the first\nquarter of 2021.

Insurance\nincome increased $101 million, or 16%, due to\ncontinued organic growth and acquisitions.\nInvestment banking and trading income\ndecreased $85 million, or 25%, due to lower\nhigh yield bond and equity originations fees,\nlower core trading income, and lower CVA\ngains, partially offset by higher structured\nreal estate fees. Residential mortgage income\ndecreased $11 million, or 11%, as lower\nproduction income (due to margins and\nrefinance volumes) was largely offset by\nhigher servicing income (due to lower\nprepayments). Excluding the gain on the\nredemption of noncontrolling equity interest,\nthe gain in the earlier quarter from the\ndivestiture of certain businesses and a $67\nmillion decrease for assets held for certain\npost-retirement benefits, which is primarily\noffset by lower personnel expense, other\nincome increased $56 million, due to higher\ninvestment income from the Company's SBIC and\nother investments.\n\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of\n2022 was up $64 million, or 1.8%, compared to\nthe earlier quarter.

Excluding the\naforementioned items and the amortization of\nintangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was\nrelatively stable compared to the earlier\nquarter. Personnel expense decreased $91\nmillion, or 4.2%, due to lower other employee\nbenefits as a result of the decrease in\nnoninterest income for post-retirement\nbenefits, lower incentives (due to declines in\nnoninterest income), and lower salaries driven\nby fewer FTEs. Additionally, other expense\nincreased $29 million due to increased\noperational losses, software expense increased\n$22 million, and marketing and customer\ndevelopment expense increased $18 million due\nto increased branding efforts.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $330\nmillion for the first quarter of 2022,\ncompared to $351 million for the earlier\nquarter. The effective tax rate for the first\nquarter of 2022 was 18.9%, compared to 19.2%\nfor the earlier quarter, primarily due to\ndiscrete tax expenses resulting from the\ndivestiture of certain businesses in the prior\nyear.\n\nTruist\u2019s total assets at March 31, 2022 were\n$544.0 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion,\nor 0.5%, compared to December 31, 2021.

The first quarter of\n2022 includes net securities losses of $69\nmillion and the gain on the redemption of\nnoncontrolling equity interest (other income)\nof $74 million. The earlier quarter included a\ngain of $37 million from the divestiture of\ncertain businesses (other income). Excluding\nthe aforementioned items, noninterest income\nwas down $23 million, or 1.1%. Insurance\nincome increased $101 million, or 16%, due to\ncontinued organic growth and acquisitions.\nInvestment banking and trading income\ndecreased $85 million, or 25%, due to lower\nhigh yield bond and equity originations fees,\nlower core trading income, and lower CVA\ngains, partially offset by higher structured\nreal estate fees. Residential mortgage income\ndecreased $11 million, or 11%, as lower\nproduction income (due to lower margins and\nrefinance volumes) was largely offset by\nhigher servicing income (due to lower\nprepayments). Excluding the gain on the\nredemption of noncontrolling equity interest,\nthe gain in the earlier quarter from the\ndivestiture of certain businesses and a $67\nmillion decrease for assets held for certain\npost-retirement benefits, which is primarily\noffset by lower personnel expense, other\nincome increased $56 million, due to higher\ninvestment income from the Company\u2019s SBIC and\nother investments.\n\n42 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \nThe following table provides a breakdown of\nTruist\u2019s noninterest expense:\n                                              \n  Ta\u2026                                         \n  3:                                          \n  No\u2026    Th\u2026                                  \n  Ex\u2026    Mo\u2026                                  \n  (D\u2026    En\u2026                                  \n  in     Ma\u2026                            %     \n  mi\u2026    31,       2022       20\u2026    Cha\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pe\u2026           $  2,0\u2026    $  2,\u2026    -4.2  %  \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Pr\u2026                                         \n  fe\u2026                                         \n  and               363       350     3.7     \n  ou\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  So\u2026               232       210    10.5     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Net                                         \n  oc\u2026               208       209    -0.5     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Am\u2026                                         \n  of                137       144    -4.9     \n  in\u2026                                         \n  Eq\u2026               118       113     4.4     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  and                84        66    27.3     \n  cu\u2026                                         \n  de\u2026                                         \n  Op\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026                48        50    -4.0     \n  de\u2026                                         \n  Lo\u2026                44        54    -18\u2026     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Re\u2026                35        25    40.0     \n  co\u2026                                         \n  Me\u2026                                         \n  and               216       141    53.2     \n  re\u2026                                         \n  ch\u2026                                         \n  Lo\u2026                                         \n  (g\u2026                                         \n  on                                          \n  ea\u2026                 \u2014        -3    -10\u2026     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  de\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026               138       109    26.6     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  To\u2026                                         \n  no\u2026           $  3,6\u2026    $  3,\u2026     1.8     \n  ex\u2026                                         \n                                              \nFirst Quarter 2022 compared to First Quarter\n2021\n\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of\n2022 was up $64 million, or 1.8%, compared to\nthe earlier quarter. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges increased $75 million\ndue to costs for client day one conversions.\nIncremental operating expenses related to the\nmerger increased $27 million, primarily\nreflected in net occupancy expense in\nconnection with updating the branch network to\nincorporate the Truist brand. The prior\nquarter also includes $36 million of expense\nassociated with an acceleration of loss\nrecognition related to certain terminated cash\nflow hedges and a small gain on the\nextinguishment of debt. Excluding the\naforementioned items and the amortization of\nintangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was\nrelatively stable compared to the earlier\nquarter. Personnel expense decreased $91\nmillion, or 4.2%, due to lower other employee\nbenefits as a result of the decrease in\nnoninterest income for post-retirement\nbenefits, lower incentives (due to declines in\nnoninterest income), and lower salaries driven\nby fewer FTEs. Additionally, other expense\nincreased $29 million due to increased\noperational losses, software expense increased\n$22 million, and marketing and customer\ndevelopment expense increased $18 million due\nto increased branding efforts.\n\nMerger-Related and Restructuring Charges\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\nmerger-related and restructuring charges and\nthe related accruals.

Segment net\ninterest income decreased $31 million\nprimarily due to lower fee income associated\nwith PPP loan forgiveness and lower purchase\naccounting accretion, partially offset by\nhigher funding credit on deposits and\nincreases to noninterest-bearing deposit\nbalances. The allocated provision for credit\nlosses decreased $115 million primarily\nreflecting a reserve release due to continued\nfavorable credit environment and lower charge\noffs in the current quarter. Noninterest\nincome decreased $73 million compared to the\nearlier quarter due to lower high yield bond\nand equity originations fees, lower credit\ntrading income, and lower CVA mark to market\ngains, partially offset by higher structured\nreal estate fees as well as higher investment\nincome from the Company\u2019s SBIC and other\ninvestments. Noninterest expense decreased $18\nmillion driven by lower professional fees and\nintangible amortization expense in the current\nquarter.\n\nC&CB average loans held for investment\ndecreased $3.7 billion, or 2.4%, for the first\nquarter of 2022 compared to the earlier\nquarter, primarily due to PPP loan\nforgiveness.

As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on a loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. For loan modification programs\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Truist\napplied the relief from TDR accounting\ndescribed in the CARES Act. Payment relief\nassistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-\naging programs, along with certain other\nmodification strategies.

Truist also\nreceives notification when the first lien\nholder, whether Truist or another financial\ninstitution, has initiated foreclosure\nproceedings against the borrower. When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nTruist estimates second lien loans where the\nfirst lien is delinquent based on historical\nexperience; the increased risk of loss on\nthese credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of\nMarch 31, 2022, Truist held or serviced the\nfirst lien on 32% of its second lien\npositions.\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 15:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Mar 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life         $       7,545    $      7,281  \n  insurance                                   \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other            6,352           6,309  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension              6,348           5,938  \n  assets                                      \n  Derivati\u2026            2,113           2,370  \n  assets                                      \n  Accounts             2,323           2,244  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Leased                                      \n  assets                                      \n  and                  2,162           2,092  \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Accrued              1,875           1,791  \n  income                                      \n  ROU                  1,126           1,168  \n  assets                                      \n  Prepaid              1,174           1,152  \n  expenses                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  securiti\u2026            1,024           1,066  \n  at fair                                     \n  value                                       \n  Other                1,428             738  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $      33,470    $     32,149  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026       J\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n52 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nAverage deposits for the first quarter of 2022\nwere $415.2 billion, an increase of $4.3\nbillion, or 1.0%, compared to the prior\nquarter.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\ntaxonomy that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk\nconversations and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces,\nboth presently and in the future, and the\nCompany\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate\u2019s adherence to and successful\nimplementation of Truist\u2019s risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany\u2019s compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the residual\nrisks associated with integrating heritage\nBB&T and heritage SunTrust. While integration\nactivities are largely complete, the Board and\nExecutive Leadership oversee the change\nmanagement program, which is designed to\nensure appropriate oversight of application\nand data center decommissioning and residual\nintegration activities, achieved through\nTruist\u2019s risk management process.\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n               Truist Financial Corporation 53\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts that are not\ncontractually tied to an index when\ndetermining its interest rate sensitivity.\nNon-maturity, interest-bearing deposit\naccounts include interest checking accounts,\nsavings accounts, and money market accounts\nthat do not have a contractual maturity.\nTruist utilizes a tiered deposit beta\nassumption framework that accounts for\nhistorically observed behaviors of clients and\nthe Company. The deposit beta assumptions are\nreduced when interest rates are exceptionally\nlow and competition for interest-bearing\ndeposits is commensurately low. As interest\nrates rise, the deposit beta assumptions also\nrise to reflect increasing competition among\nbanks as well as increased client demand for\ninterest-bearing deposits. Truist applies an\naverage deposit beta of approximately 25% for\nthe first 100 basis point increase in the\nFederal funds rate, approximately 35% for the\nsecond 100 basis point increase, and\napproximately 50% for any additional\nincreases. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nRate sensitivity increased compared to prior\nperiods, primarily driven by a change to the\nCompany\u2019s deposit beta assumptions, partially\noffset by an increase in the investment\nsecurities portfolio.\n\n54 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nmay increase interest-bearing funds to offset\nthe loss of this advantageous funding source.\nAlternatively, the Company may reduce the size\nof its investment portfolio to offset the loss\nof noninterest-bearing demand deposits to\nlimit the impact on the balance sheet\u2019s asset\nsensitivity.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at\n100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  18:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resul\u2026                \n  Grad\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assum\u2026                \n  Chan\u2026        at            a                \n  in        March       Decre\u2026                \n  Rates       31,           in                \n  (bps)      2022       Nonin\u2026                \n              (1)       Demand                \n                        Depos\u2026                \n              $20          $40                \n           Billi\u2026       Billi\u2026                \n  Up         4.27  %      3.45  %    2.63  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      3.29         2.69       2.10     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at March 31, 2022 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nand mortgage banking operations, long-term\ndebt, and other funding sources. Truist hedges\na portion of its AFS securities to reduce\nmark-to-market volatility within AOCI and also\nto increase its overall asset sensitivity\nposition. Truist has utilized derivatives to\nfacilitate transactions on behalf of its\nclients and as part of associated hedging\nactivities. As of March 31, 2022, Truist had\nderivative financial instruments outstanding\nwith notional amounts totaling $320.5 billion,\nwith an associated net fair value of $631\nmillion. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional disclosures.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nFor most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the\nadministrator of LIBOR extended publication\nuntil June 30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently\nby Truist, including one week and two month\nU.S. dollar LIBOR and all non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, ceased publication at December 31,\n2021, based on the October 20, 2021\ninteragency Joint Statement on Managing the\nLIBOR transition. To prepare for the\ntransition to an alternative reference rate,\nmanagement formed a cross-functional project\nteam to address the LIBOR transition. The\nproject team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board. As of\nMarch 31, 2022, Truist had outstanding LIBOR-\nbased instruments that mature after June 30,\n2023, including: loan and lease exposures\ntotaling approximately $159 billion, notional\nderivative exposure totaling approximately\n$135 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion,\nand preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These\namounts are inclusive of remediated contracts,\nwhich contain adequate fallback language for\nthe transition.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases has largely been reviewed and\ncertain contracts will require amendments to\nsupport the transition away from LIBOR. For\nimpacted lines of business, the Company has\nstarted remediating these contracts to include\nstandardized fallback language. Current\nfallback language used for new, renewed, and\nmodified contracts is generally consistent\nwith ARRC recommendations and includes use of\n\u201chardwired fallback\u201d language, where\nappropriate.\n\nThe progress and approach to remediation will\nvary based on the type of contract and\nexisting language used in the agreement. For\ncommercial lending and general consumer\nlending, a significant number of remaining\nLIBOR contracts will require client outreach\nand remediation. Efforts to amend and\nremediate contracts, excluding mortgage and\nstudent loans, that mature post June 30, 2023\n($148 billion) will be accelerated in 2022.\nTruist has determined that adjustable rate\nmortgage products ($4.0 billion) have\nconsistent and adequate fallback language to\ntransition away from LIBOR in line with\nindustry expectations; therefore, these\ncontracts will not require remediation.\nRemediation of student loans ($5.8 billion)\nwill depend on guidance from the Department of\nEducation and recent guidance from the CFPB to\nallow transition to \u201ccomparable rates,\u201d\nincluding SOFR or Prime. Certain derivatives\nwithout a clearly defined or practicable\nreplacement benchmark rate will use the recent\nFederal legislation to replace LIBOR with a\nSOFR-based rate that will be established by\nFRB rulemaking. This legislation will also\nprovide additional administrative benefit for\na small portion of the commercial and consumer\nlending portfolios where contracts do not\ncontain fallback language.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 55\nTraining has been provided for impacted\nteammates and will continue during 2022.\nTruist will continue to provide timely notices\nand information to impacted clients about the\ntransition during 2022 and the first half of\n2023. Truist continues to manage the impact of\nthese contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and related operational and market\nrisks on established project plans for\nbusiness and operational readiness to support\nthe transition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate for all product offerings,\nexcept on a limited basis, as permissible.\nMarket risks associated with this change are\ndependent on the alternative reference rates\navailable and market conditions as of the\ntransition. The Company is actively using SOFR\nas a reference rate and has originated\napproximately $30 billion of loans, issued $5\nbillion of long-term debt, and has $50 billion\nin notional derivative exposure using this\nalternative reference rate as of March 31,\n2022. Truist expects SOFR to become a more\ncommonly-used pricing benchmark across the\nindustry and will continue to offer additional\nSOFR based products during 2022. Additional\nalternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg\nShort Term Bank Yield will be supported based\non market demand. Other emerging credit\nsensitive rates will be evaluated as\nadditional alternatives for LIBOR based on\nmarket developments.

Risk\nFactors\u201d in the Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$33 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of March 31, 2022.\n\n56 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Average\none and ten day VaR measures declined from\nlast year as heightened market volatility\nexperienced during March 2020 aged out of the\n12-month VaR look-back window.\n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026            \u2026                          \n      \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n      \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  \n                   \u2026       6       \u2026       \u2026  \n                   9       3       3       3  \n                   \u2026       4       5       3  \n                                              \n                           4               2  \n                           4               4  \n                           4               1  \n                           \u2014               \u2014  \n                           \u2026               \u2026  \n                           4               3  \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, VaR\nmeasures briefly increased in the first\nquarter of 2022 due to the increase in market\nvolatility that normalized towards the end of\nthe quarter. There were no Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions during the twelve\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. The total number\nof Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nover the preceding twelve months is used to\ndetermine the multiplication factor for the\nVaR-based capital requirement under the Market\nRisk Rule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other critical teammates to follow in the\nevent of a liquidity contraction or in\nanticipation of such an event. The plan\naddresses authority for activation and\ndecision making, liquidity options, and the\nresponsibilities of key departments in the\nevent of a liquidity contraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $83.9 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 111% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At March 31,\n2022, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window.

The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Parent Company had 30\nmonths and 35 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n19 months and 19 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings.\n\nThe credit ratings and outlooks of Truist and\nTruist Bank are unchanged from those presented\nin the Company\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nminimums. Management evaluates whether capital\nratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above minimums specified by the FRB for\nthe annual CCAR process.

Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations, and related disclosures. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nsecurities, MSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and\nderivative assets and liabilities; goodwill\nand other intangible assets; income taxes; and\npension and postretirement benefit\nobligations.

Based on that evaluation,\nthe CEO and CFO concluded that the Company\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and procedures were\neffective.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial\nReporting\n\nManagement of Truist is responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as defined in\nRule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Truist\ncompleted platform conversions related to its\ncommercial, direct-to-consumer and mortgage\nlending portfolios, as well as platform\nconversions related to its deposits and\npayment processing systems. In connection with\nthese activities, Truist fully integrated\ncertain surviving applications into its\ngeneral ledger accounting system. Internal\ncontrols and processes have been appropriately\nmodified to address changes in key business\napplications and financial processes as a\nresult of these implementations.\n\nThere were no other changes in the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of\nthe Exchange Act) that occurred during the\nquarter ended March 31, 2022 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n          PART II.
