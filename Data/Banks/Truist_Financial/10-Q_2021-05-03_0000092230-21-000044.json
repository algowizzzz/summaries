Such statements\ninvolve inherent uncertainties, risks, and\nchanges in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. As such, Truist\u2019s actual results may\ndiffer materially from those contemplated by\nforward-looking statements. While there can be\nno assurance that any list of risks and\nuncertainties or risk factors is complete,\nimportant factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by forward-looking statements\ninclude the following, without limitation, as\nwell as the risks and uncertainties more fully\ndiscussed in Part II, Item 1A-Risk Factors in\nthis report and Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors\nin Truist\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020:\n\n\u2022 risks and uncertainties relating to the\nMerger of heritage BB&T and heritage

BB&T and heritage\nSunTrust;\n\n\u2022 deposit attrition, client loss or revenue\nloss following completed mergers or\nacquisitions may be greater than anticipated;\n\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the\nglobal economy, adversely impacted Truist\u2019s\nfinancial condition, and results of\noperations, including through increased\nexpenses, reduced fee income and net interest\nmargin and increases in the allowance for\ncredit losses, and continuation of current\nconditions could worsen these impacts and also\nadversely affect Truist\u2019s capital and\nliquidity position or cost of capital, impair\nthe ability of borrowers to repay outstanding\nloans, cause an outflow of deposits, and\nimpair goodwill or other assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist is subject to credit risk by lending\nor committing to lend money, and may have more\ncredit risk and higher credit losses to the\nextent that loans are concentrated by loan\ntype, industry segment, borrower type or\nlocation of the borrower or collateral;\n\n\u2022 changes in the interest rate environment,\nincluding the replacement of LIBOR as an\ninterest rate benchmark and potentially\nnegative interest rates, which could

short-term funding or\nliquidity, loss of client deposits or changes\nin Truist\u2019s credit ratings, which could\nincrease the cost of funding or limit access\nto capital markets;\n\n\u2022 risk management oversight functions may not\nidentify or address risks adequately, and\nmanagement may not be able to effectively\nmanage credit risk;\n\n\u2022 risks resulting from the extensive use of\nmodels in Truist\u2019s business, which may impact\ndecisions made by management and regulators;\n\n\u2022 failure to execute on strategic or\noperational plans, including the ability to\nsuccessfully complete or integrate mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\n\u2022 increased competition, including from (i)\nnew or existing competitors that could have\ngreater financial resources or be subject to\ndifferent regulatory standards, and (ii)\nproducts and services offered by non-bank\nfinancial technology companies, may reduce\nTruist\u2019s client base, cause Truist to lower\nprices for its products and services in order\nto maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public opinion, which could damage\nTruist\u2019s reputation;\n\n\u2022 increased scrutiny regarding Truist\u2019s\nconsumer sales practices, training practices,\nincentive compensation design, and governance;\n\n\u2022 regulatory matters, litigation or other\nlegal actions, which may result in, among\nother things, costs, fines, penalties,\nrestrictions on Truist\u2019s business activities,\nreputational harm, negative publicity, or\nother adverse consequences;\n\n\u2022 evolving legislative, accounting and\nregulatory standards, including with respect\nto capital and liquidity requirements, and\nresults of regulatory examinations may\nadversely affect Truist\u2019s financial condition\nand results of operations;\n\n\u2022 the monetary and fiscal policies of the\nfederal government and its agencies could have\na material adverse effect on profitability;\n\n\u2022 accounting policies and processes require\nmanagement to make estimates about matters\nthat are uncertain, including the potential\nwrite down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, and\ninstability in global geopolitical matters or\nvolatility in financial markets could result\nin, among other things, slower deposit or\nasset growth, a deterioration in credit\nquality, or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance, or other services;\n\n\u2022 risks related to originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as a loan\nservicer, including an increase in the scope\nor costs of the services Truist is required to\nperform, without any corresponding increase in\nservicing fees or a breach of Truist\u2019s\nobligations as servicer;\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s success depends on hiring and\nretaining key personnel, and if these\nindividuals leave or change roles without\neffective replacements, Truist\u2019s operations\nand integration activities could be adversely\nimpacted, which could be exacerbated as Truist\ncontinues to integrate the management teams of\nheritage BB&T and heritage SunTrust;\n\n\u2022 fraud or misconduct by internal or external\nparties, which Truist may not be able to\nprevent, detect, or mitigate;\n\n\u2022 security risks, including denial of service\nattacks, hacking, social engineering attacks\ntargeting Truist\u2019s teammates and clients,\nmalware intrusion, data corruption attempts,\nsystem breaches, cyber attacks, and identity\ntheft, could result in the disclosure of\nconfidential information, adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s business or reputation or create\nsignificant legal or financial exposure; and\n\n\u2022 widespread outages of operational,\ncommunication, or other systems, whether\ninternal or provided by third parties, natural\nor other disasters (including acts of\nterrorism and pandemics), and the effects of\nclimate change could have an adverse effect on\nTruist\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations, lead to material disruption of\nTruist\u2019s operations or the ability or\nwillingness of clients to access Truist\u2019s\nproducts and services.\n\nReaders are

These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements.

Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nfinancial instruments; valuation of MSRs;\ngoodwill, intangible assets and other purchase\naccounting related adjustments; benefit plan\nobligations and expenses; and tax assets,\nliabilities, and expense.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThere were no standards adopted during the\ncurrent year that had a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements, and no\nstandards not yet adopted by the Company that\nare expected to have a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\n                                              \n  NOTE 2.

The\ndecrease reflects a change in the composition\nof unfunded commitments and the improving\neconomic forecast.\n\nTruist\u2019s ACL estimate represents management\u2019s\nbest estimate of expected credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolio,\nincluding unfunded commitments, at the balance\nsheet date. This estimate incorporates both\nquantitatively-derived output, as well as\nqualitative components that represent expected\nlosses not otherwise captured by the models.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, which management has determined to be\ntwo years, followed by a reversion to long-\nterm historical loss conditions over a one-\nyear period. These macro-economic forecasts\ninclude a number of key economic variables\nutilized in loss forecasting that include, but\nare not limited to, unemployment trends, US\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates, property values, the primary 30-year\nmortgage rate, home price indices and used car\nprices.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 15\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird -party baseline forecast that is\nadjusted to reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate\noutlook. Management also considered multiple\nthird-party macro-economic forecasts that\nreflected a range of possible outcomes in\norder to capture uncertainty in the economic\nenvironment caused by the pandemic. The\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nMarch 31, 2021 included a GDP recovery to pre-\npandemic levels in the third quarter of 2021\nwith an improving unemployment rate to the\nmid-single-digits through the end of 2021\nfollowed by continued improvement through the\nremainder of the reasonable and supportable\nperiod.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses in\ntimes of rapidly changing macro-economic\nforecasts. As a result, management believes\nthat the qualitative component of the ACL,\nwhich incorporates management\u2019s expert\njudgment related to expected future credit\nlosses, will continue to represent a\nsignificant portion of the ACL for the\nforeseeable future. The March 31, 2021 ACL\nestimate includes qualitative adjustments to\naddress limitations in modeled results with\nrespect to forecasted economic conditions that\nare well outside of historic economic ranges\nused to develop the models. These adjustments\ngive consideration to other risks in the\nportfolio, including the impact of government\nrelief programs, stimulus and client\naccommodations, that are not directly\nconsidered in the quantitative models.\nPCD Loan Activity\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is recognized in the\nALLL on the date of acquisition using the same\nmethodology as other loans held for\ninvestment.

to\nbe predictive of future performance. As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are fixed income instruments\nprimarily composed of syndicated bank loans.\nThe TRS contracts pass through interest and\nother cash flows on the reference assets to\nthe third party clients, along with exposing\nthose clients to decreases in value on the\nassets and providing them with the rights to\nappreciation on the assets. The terms of the\nTRS contracts require the third parties to\npost initial margin collateral, as well as\nongoing margin as the fair values of the\nunderlying reference assets change.\n\nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, that could potentially be\nsignificant. At March 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet reflected $\n1.5billion of assets and $ 66million of other\nliabilities of the VIEs. At December 31, 2020,\nthe Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet\nreflected $ 1.3billion of assets and $\n41million of other liabilities of the VIEs.\nAssets at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\ninclude $ 1.3billion in trading loans and\nbonds. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird party clients via the TRS contracts.

Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law. Assets pledged\nto the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable\nasset discounts when determining borrowing\ncapacity. The Company obtains secured\nfinancing and letters of credit from the FRB\nand FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of credit from\nthe FHLB can be used to secure various client\ndeposits, including public fund relationships.\nExcluding assets related to employee benefit\nplans, the majority of the agreements\ngoverning the pledged assets do not permit the\nother party to sell or repledge the\ncollateral.

The matters range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with multiple class members\nand can involve claims for substantial\namounts. Investigations involve both formal\nand informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThese legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration, or investigation\nand may consist of a variety of claims,\nincluding common law tort and contract claims,\nas well as statutory antitrust, securities,\nand consumer protection claims. The ultimate\nresolution of any proceeding is uncertain and\ninherently difficult to predict. It is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters, if unfavorable, may be material to\nthe consolidated financial position,\nconsolidated results of operations, or\nconsolidated cash flows of Truist.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of March 31,\n2021. This estimate is based upon currently\navailable information and involves\nconsiderable judgment, given that claims often\ninclude significant legal uncertainties,\ndamages alleged by plaintiffs are often\nunspecified or overstated, discovery may not\nhave started or may not be complete and\nmaterial facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nwill change from time to time and actual\nlosses may vary significantly from this\nestimate. As a result, the Company does not\nbelieve that an estimate of reasonably\npossible losses can be made for certain\nmatters. Such matters are not reflected in the\nestimate provided herein.\n\nThe following is a description of a certain\nlegal proceeding in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived. On October 6, 2017, the trial court\ngranted plaintiff\u2019s motion for class\ncertification and defined the class as \u201cEvery\nGeorgia citizen who had or has one or more\naccounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July\n12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least\none overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting\nfrom an ATM or debit card transaction (the\n\u201cTransaction\u201d); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees\nas a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did\nnot receive a refund of those Fees,\u201d and the\ngranting of a certified class was affirmed on\nappeal. On April 8, 2020, the Company filed a\nmotion seeking to narrow the scope of this\nclass, and on May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed\nmotion to compel arbitration of the claims of\nsome of the class members. On February 9,\n2021, the trial court denied both motions as\npremature but held that the issues could be\nraised again after the conclusion of\ndiscovery, which is currently underway. The\nCompany believes that the claims are without\nmerit.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\n                                              \n  NOTE 14.

The remaining assets are\nmeasured at the lower of cost or fair value,\nless costs to sell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

investment\nbanking business, the Company enters into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, credit\ndefault swaps, risk participations, and TRS.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nThe Company has entered into TRS contracts on\nloans. To mitigate its credit risk, the\nCompany typically receives initial margin from\nthe counterparty upon entering into the TRS\nand variation margin if the fair value of the\nunderlying reference assets deteriorates. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s TRS\ncontracts, see \u201cNote 13. Commitments and\nContingencies.\u201d\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At March 31, 2021,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 10 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100 percent\ndefault by all obligors on the maximum value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

The FRB also\nannounced plans to propose several potential\nmodifications to the supplementary leverage\nratio to ensure that the supplementary\nleverage ratio remains effective in an\nenvironment of higher reserves, though such\nproposal had not been published as of the date\nof this report.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nTruist had a strong financial performance in\nthe first quarter of 2021 and several\nsignificant milestones that are reflective of\nits purpose in action.

On a TE basis, revenue was\nalso $5.5 billion for the first quarter of\n2021, a decrease of $138 million compared to\nthe same period in 2020, reflecting a decrease\nof $374 million in TE net interest income, and\nan increase of $236 million in noninterest\nincome.\n\nNIM was 3.01 percent for the first quarter of\n2021, down 57 basis points compared to the\nprior year.

Net charge-\noffs for the first quarter of 2021 totaled\n$238 million compared to $272 million in the\nearlier quarter. The net charge-off rate for\nthe current quarter of 0.33 percent was down\nthree basis points compared to the first\nquarter of 2020.\n\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of\n2021 increased $236 million compared to the\nearlier quarter, driven by increases in\ninsurance income of $77 million, and\ninvestment banking and trading income of $222\nmillion. Other income increased $76 million\nprimarily due to income from assets held for\ncertain post-retirement benefits, which is\nprimarily offset by higher personnel expense.\nOther income also includes a $37 million gain\nfrom the divestiture of certain businesses,\nwhich was mostly offset by gains from credit\ndefault swaps recorded in the earlier quarter.\nLending related fees increased $33 million.\nThese increases were partially offset by a\ndecline in residential mortgage income of $145\nmillion, as well as a decline in service\ncharges on deposits of $47 million.\n\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of\n2021 was up $179 million compared to the\nearlier quarter.

This produced an effective tax rate\nfor the first quarter of 2021 of 19.2 percent,\ncompared to 17.4 percent for the earlier\nquarter. The higher effective tax rate in the\nfirst quarter of 2021 was primarily due to\nhigher pre-tax income and discrete tax\nexpenses resulting from the divestiture of\ncertain businesses in the current year.\n\nTruist\u2019s total assets at March 31, 2021 were\n$517.5 billion, an increase of $8.3 billion\ncompared to December 31, 2020. The increase in\ntotal assets was primarily a result of an\nincrease of $13.2 billion in interest-bearing\ndeposits driving higher balances held at the\nFederal Reserve and an increase of $3.0\nbillion in AFS securities. These increases\nwere partially offset by an $8.6 billion\ndecline in total loans and leases.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 37\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2021 were $395.6\nbillion, an increase of $14.5 billion compared\nto December 31, 2020. Deposit growth was\nstrong for the first quarter of 2021 driven by\ngrowth resulting from additional government\nstimulus programs and pandemic-related client\nbehavior, partially offset by a decrease in\ntime deposits primarily due to the maturity of\nwholesale negotiable certificates of deposit\nand higher-cost personal accounts.\n\nAsset quality ratios were stable at March 31,\n2021. As of March 31, 2021, nonperforming\nassets were 0.25 percent of total assets.

Corporation\n\nNonperforming assets totaled $1.3 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021, down $88 million compared to\nDecember 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans and\nleases represented 0.42 percent of total loans\nand leases, down two basis points compared to\nDecember 31, 2020. Nonperforming loans and\nleases held for investment decreased $159\nmillion, primarily in the commercial and\nindustrial portfolio, while nonperforming\nloans held for sale increased $67 million as a\nportfolio of residential mortgage loans was\ntransferred to held for sale during the\nquarter.\n\nPerforming TDRs were up $178 million during\nthe first quarter primarily in the residential\nmortgage and commercial and industrial\nportfolios. The increase in residential\nmortgage was driven by modifications of loans\nthat were not eligible for relief in\naccordance with the provisions of the CARES\nAct. The increase in commercial and industrial\nloan modifications was driven by an increase\nin the volume of loans entering workout\nagreements.\n\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing totaled $2.1 billion at March 31,\n2021, up $64 million compared to the prior\nquarter. The increase was primarily in\nresidential mortgage loans due to the\nrepurchase of delinquent government guaranteed\nloans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing as a percentage of\nloans and leases was 0.71 percent at March 31,\n2021, up four basis points from the prior\nquarter. Excluding government guaranteed\nloans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing as a percentage of\nloans and leases was 0.04 percent at March 31,\n2021, unchanged from December 31, 2020.\n\nLoans 30-89 days past due and still accruing\ntotaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2021, down\n$432 million compared to the prior quarter.\nThe decrease was primarily in consumer loans\nfor residential mortgage and indirect\nautomobile due to seasonality and consumers\nreceiving stimulus funds. The ratio of loans\n30-89 days past due and still accruing as a\npercentage of loans and leases was 0.61\npercent at March 31, 2021 down, 13 basis\npoints from the prior quarter.\n\nProblem loans include NPLs and loans that are\n90 days or more past due and still accruing as\ndisclosed in Table 10. In addition, for the\ncommercial portfolio segment, loans that are\nrated special mention or substandard\nperforming are closely monitored by management\nas potential problem loans.

As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on a loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES\nAct, Truist implemented loan modification\nprograms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nin order to provide borrowers with flexibility\nwith respect to repayment terms. Payment\nrelief assistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-\naging programs, along with certain other\nmodification strategies. The Company adopted\ncertain provisions of the CARES Act and other\nregulatory guidance that provide relief from\nthe requirement to apply TDR accounting to (1)\ncertain modifications of federally backed\nmortgages upon request from the borrower, and\n(2) certain modifications of other non-\nfederally backed mortgages for borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that were\nless than 30 days past due at December 31,\n2019.

The allowance for loan\nand lease losses covered nonperforming loans\nand leases held for investment 4.84 times\ncompared to 4.39 times at December 31, 2020.\nAt March 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and\nlease losses was 5.87 times annualized net\ncharge-offs, compared to 7.15 times at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nNet charge-offs during the first quarter\ntotaled $238 million, up $33 million compared\nto the prior quarter. As a percentage of\naverage loans and leases, annualized net\ncharge-offs were 0.33 percent, up six basis\npoints compared to the prior quarter. The\nincrease in net charge-offs was primarily in\nthe indirect auto portfolio due to\nseasonality.\n\nThe following table presents an allocation of\nthe ALLL.

When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nTruist estimates second lien loans where the\nfirst lien is delinquent based on historical\nexperience; the increased risk of loss on\nthese credits is reflected in the ALLL.

The cost\nof average interest-bearing deposits was 0.07\npercent for the first quarter, down four basis\npoints compared to the prior quarter.\n\nBorrowings\n\nAt March 31, 2021, short-term borrowings\ntotaled $5.9 billion, a decrease of $203\nmillion compared to December 31, 2020, due\nprimarily to a decrease of $649 million in\nshort-term FHLB advances, partially offset by\nan increase of $272 million in securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase.\n\nAverage short-term borrowings were $6.7\nbillion or 1.6 percent of total funding for\nthe first quarter of 2021, as compared to\n$18.9 billion or 4.7 percent for the prior\nyear. Average short-term borrowings decreased\nas a percentage of funding sources due to\nstrong deposit growth. Long-term debt provides\nfunding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory\ncapital, and primarily consists of senior and\nsubordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist\nBank. Long-term debt totaled $37.8 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.8 billion\ncompared to December 31, 2020. During 2021,\n$3.0 billion of senior notes matured. These\nmaturities were partially offset by issuances\nof $1.3 billion of senior notes with an\ninterest rate of 1.27 percent maturing in\n2027. FHLB advances represented 2.3 percent of\ntotal outstanding long-term debt at March 31,\n2021, compared to 2.2 percent at December 31,\n2020. The average cost of long-term debt was\n1.57 percent for the three months ended March\n31, 2021, down 77 basis points compared to the\nsame period in 2020.\n\nIn April 2021, Truist redeemed $1.3 billion of\nfixed rate senior notes due in May 2021. In\nMay 2021, Truist redeemed $250 million of\nfloating rate senior notes due in June 2021.\n\nShareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity was $67.9 billion\nat March 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.0 billion\nfrom December 31, 2020. This decrease includes\na decrease of $2.2 billion in AOCI,\nredemptions of $950 million in preferred stock\nfor Series F and G, $722 million in dividends\nand $506 million in repurchases of common\nstock, partially offset by $1.5 billion in net\nincome available to common shareholders.\nTruist\u2019s book value per common share at March\n31, 2021 was $45.17, compared to $46.52 at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nIn connection with the redemptions of\npreferred stock, net income available to\ncommon shareholders was reduced by $26 million\nto recognize the difference between the\nredemption price and the carrying value.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\ntaxonomy that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk\nconversations and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces,\nboth presently and in the future, and the\nCompany\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate\u2019s adherence to and successful\nimplementation of Truist\u2019s risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany\u2019s compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the risks\nassociated with integrating heritage BB&T and\nheritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive\nLeadership oversee the change management\nprogram, which is designed to ensure key\ndecisions are reviewed and that there is\nappropriate oversight of integration\nactivities.\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s BUs. Interest\nrate risk results from differences between the\ntiming of rate changes and the timing of cash\nflows associated with assets and liabilities\n(re-pricing risk); from changing rate\nrelationships among different yield curves\naffecting bank activities (basis risk); from\nchanging rate relationships across the\nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and\nfrom interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk both on its assets and\non its liabilities. Truist actively manages\nits interest rate risk exposure through the\nstrategic repricing of its assets and\nliabilities, taking into account the volumes,\nmaturities, and mix, with the goal of keeping\nnet interest margin as stable as possible.\nTruist primarily uses three methods to measure\nand monitor its interest rate risk: (i)\nsimulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 53\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, and projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas are an important assumption in\nthe interest rate risk modeling process.\nTruist applies an average deposit beta (the\nsensitivity of deposit rate changes relative\nto market rate changes) of approximately 50\npercent to its non-maturity interest-bearing\ndeposit accounts when determining its interest\nrate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-\nbearing deposit accounts include interest\nchecking accounts, savings accounts, and money\nmarket accounts that do not have a contractual\nmaturity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nRate sensitivity increased compared to the\nprior periods, primarily driven by increased\ndeposits as a result of government stimulus\nprograms.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nwould increase interest-bearing funds to\noffset the loss of this advantageous funding\nsource.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of demand deposits and an\nassociated increase in managed rate deposits\nunder various scenarios. For purposes of this\nanalysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta\nof managed rate deposits for the replacement\nof the demand deposits at 100 percent.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  20:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resul\u2026                \n  Line\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assum\u2026                \n  Chan\u2026        at            a                \n  in        March       Decre\u2026                \n  Rates       31,           in                \n  (bps)      2021       Nonin\u2026                \n              (1)       Demand                \n                        Depos\u2026                \n              $20          $40                \n           Billi\u2026       Billi\u2026                \n  Up         3.74  %      2.92  %    2.09  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      2.92         2.32       1.72     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at March 31, 2021 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on\nlonger-term projected changes in asset and\nliability values given potential changes in\ninterest rates.

For most\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the administrator\nof LIBOR is extending publication until June\n30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently by Truist,\nincluding one week and two month U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, are still anticipated to cease\npublication at December 31, 2021, based on\nthis new guidance. Truist has U.S. dollar\nLIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June\n30, 2023. To prepare for the transition to an\nalternative reference rate, management has\nformed a cross-functional project team to\naddress the LIBOR transition. The project team\nhas performed an assessment to identify the\npotential risks related to the transition from\nLIBOR to a new index. The project team\nprovides updates to Executive Leadership and\nthe Board.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases is under review and certain\ncontracts will need updated provisions for the\ntransition. Current fallback language used for\nnew, renewed, and modified contracts is\ngenerally consistent with ARRC\nrecommendations. Updates to current fallback\nlanguage will be evaluated according to new\nregulatory guidance for the extension of\ntimelines for the transition and expectations\nfor production of U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts\nduring 2021. Truist continues to manage the\nimpact of these contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and related operational and market\nrisks on established project plans for\nbusiness and operational readiness for the\ntransition. Market risks associated with this\nchange are dependent on the alternative\nreference rates available and market\nconditions at transition.

Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall covered positions.

Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of March 31, 2021.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99 percent\nconfidence level. For Market Risk Rule\npurposes, the Company calculates VaR using a\n10-day holding period and a 99 percent\nconfidence level. Due to inherent limitations\nof the VaR methodology, such as the assumption\nthat past market behavior is indicative of\nfuture market performance, VaR is only one of\nseveral tools used to measure and manage\nmarket risk. Other tools used to actively\nmanage market risk include stress testing,\nprofit and loss attribution, and stop loss\nlimits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nHeightened market volatility experienced\nduring March 2020 significantly impacted the\nyear-over-year comparison.\n                                              \n  T\u2026                                          \n  2\u2026                                          \n  V\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026       20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (\u2026       10\u2026       1-\u2026       10\u2026       1-\u2026  \n  in       Ho\u2026       Ho\u2026       Ho\u2026       Ho\u2026  \n  m\u2026       Pe\u2026       Pe\u2026       Pe\u2026       Pe\u2026  \n  V\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $   68    $   16    $   30    $   10  \n  A\u2026        39        10        10         3  \n  M\u2026         3         3         3         1  \n  P\u2026         5         3        19         8  \n  V\u2026                                          \n  by                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                   2                   5  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                   4                   4  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                   1                   8  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                   \u2014                   \u2014  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                  -5                  -9  \n  D\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                   3                   8  \n                                              \nFor most of the first quarter of 2021, the\nrolling 12-month VaR historic look-back window\nincorporated the peak March 2020 volatility,\nwhich contributed to the increase in Average\nand Maximum VaR.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.\nThe total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities. As of March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, Truist\u2019s liquid asset buffer, as a\npercent of total assets, was 23.2 percent and\n20.2 percent, respectively.\n\nThe LCR rule directs large U.S. banking\norganizations to hold unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets sufficient to withstand\nprojected 30-day total net cash outflows, as\ndefined under the LCR rule. As of January 1,\n2020, Truist is subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist\u2019s average LCR\nwas 111 percent for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021, well above the regulatory\nminimum of 100 percent.\n\nThe ability to raise funding at competitive\nprices is affected by the rating agencies\u2019\nviews of the Parent Company\u2019s and Truist\nBank\u2019s credit quality, liquidity, capital, and\nearnings. Management meets with the rating\nagencies on a regular basis to discuss current\noutlooks. There were no changes to the ratings\nof Truist or Truist Bank by the major rating\nagencies during the quarter ended March 31,\n2021. See the \u201cLiquidity\u201d section of MD&A in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 for additional\ninformation regarding credit ratings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, retirement of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt.\n\nSee \u201cNote 22. Parent Company Financial\nInformation\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Parent Company had 40\nmonths and 43 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n22 months at each such date when including the\npayment of common stock dividends.\n\nTruist Bank\n\nTruist carefully manages liquidity risk at\nTruist Bank. Truist Bank\u2019s primary source of\nfunding is client deposits. Continued access\nto client deposits is highly dependent on\npublic confidence in the stability of Truist\nBank and its ability to return funds to\nclients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. At March 31, 2021, Truist\nBank had $203.4 billion of available secured\nborrowing capacity, which represents\napproximately 10.7 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless. In addition to secured borrowing\nsources, Truist had excess eligible cash at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of $26.8 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments,\nContingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 for\ndiscussion with respect to Truist\u2019s\nquantitative and qualitative disclosures about\nits fixed and determinable contractual\nobligations. Truist\u2019s commitments include\ninvestments in affordable housing projects\nthroughout its market area, renewable energy\ncredits, private equity funds, derivative\ncontracts to manage various financial risks,\nas well as other commitments.

Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, and provide a competitive return\nto shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios,\nwhich include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,\nand Total capital are calculated based on\nregulatory guidance related to the measurement\nof capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nminimums. Management has implemented stressed\ncapital ratio minimum targets to evaluate\nwhether capital ratios calculated after the\neffect of alternative capital actions are\nlikely to remain above minimums specified by\nthe FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches\nof stressed minimum targets prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist\u2019s capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n           \u2026               \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026                  \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Truist targets are subject to revision\nbased on regulatory guidance, feedback, and\nother strategic factors.\n\n(2) Truist\u2019s goal is to maintain capital\nlevels above all regulatory minimums.\n\n(3) Reflects a SCB of 270 basis points for\nTruist.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 59\nWhile nonrecurring events or management\ndecisions may result in the Company\ntemporarily falling below its operating\ntargets for one or more of these ratios, it is\nmanagement\u2019s intent to return to these\noperating targets within a reasonable period\nof time through capital planning.

For the\nsecond quarter of 2021, Truist intends to\nexecute share repurchases consistent with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s capital restrictions\nannounced on March 25, 2021.
