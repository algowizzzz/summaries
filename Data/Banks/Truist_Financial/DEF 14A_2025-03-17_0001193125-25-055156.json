Alternatively, the Board may reduce\nthe number of persons to be elected by the    \nnumber of directors unable to serve. In an    \nuncontested election of directors, our        \narticles of incorporation require each        \ndirector to be elected by the majority of the \nvotes cast at a meeting of shareholders. Under\nour Director Resignation Policy, as described \nin our Corporate Governance Guidelines, any   \nincumbent director nominee who fails to       \nreceive more votes in favor of the director\u2019s \nelection than against the director\u2019s election \nshall tender his or her resignation to the    \nBoard, which will be conditioned on the       \nBoard\u2019s acceptance of the resignation. The    \nNominating and Governance Committee will then \nconsider all of the relevant facts and        \ncircumstances and recommend to the Board      \nwhether to accept, reject, or otherwise act   \nwith respect to the tendered resignation. The \nBoard will act on the Nominating and          \nGovernance Committee\u2019s recommendation within  \n90 days following certification of the        \nshareholder vote and will publicly disclose   \nits decision within this 90-daytimeframe. A   \ndirector whose resignation is under           \nconsideration will abstain from participating \nin any recommendation or decision regarding   \nthat resignation. If a director\u2019s resignation \nis not accepted, the director will continue to\nserve until the next annual meeting of        \nshareholders and until the director\u2019s         \nsuccessor is elected and qualified, or until  \nthe director\u2019s earlier resignation or removal.\nEach of our director nominees has been        \nidentified as possessing good business acumen,\nstrength of character, and an independent     \nmind, as well as a reputation for integrity   \nand the highest personal and professional     \nethics. Sound judgment and community          \nleadership are also important characteristics \nthat our nominees possess. Each nominee       \nadditionally brings to us a strong and unique \nbackground and set of skills, providing our   \nBoard with collective strength in overseeing  \nTruist\u2019s strategy, culture, and performance.  \nBoard Composition The Board and the Nominating\nand Governance Committee strive to recruit and\nretain directors who possess a broad array of \nskills, backgrounds, and expertise that, taken\nas a whole, create a strong and effective     \ngoverning body.

Working with the       \nCompensation Consultant (as defined in the    \n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d), the  \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee      \nannually assesses the competitiveness of      \nTruist\u2019s director compensation program        \nrelative to our peers. In making this         \nassessment, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee reviews (i) the individual pay      \ncomponents of our program relative to the pay \ncomponents for directors at our peers, (ii)   \nthe average total compensation of our Board   \nmembers relative to directors at our peers,   \nand (iii) our aggregate Board compensation as \ncompared to our peer group. The director      \ncompensation shown in the 2024 Director       \nCompensation Table below reflects total       \ncompensation paid to each director for service\nas a member of the Boards of both the Company \nand Truist Bank. A director who is also a     \nteammate of Truist or its subsidiaries is not \neligible to receive any equity, retainer, or  \nfees for service on either Board. The table   \nbelow shows the fees paid to our non-         \nemployeedirectors for 2024. In its annual     \nreview of our director compensation program   \nfor 2025, the Compensation and Human Capital  \nCommittee determined that no adjustments      \nneeded to be made at the time to the fees our \nnon-employeedirectors are entitled to receive \nfor 2025. Each director receives a base       \nretainer of $100,000. The Lead Director,      \ncommittee chairs (other than Mr. Rogers, who  \nreceives no additional compensation for his   \nrole as Chair of the Executive Committee), and\nnon-chairmembers of the Audit and Risk        \nCommittees receive the additional retainers   \nset forth below.                              \n                                              \n  Amount of Annual       Position             \n  Retainer                                    \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aEach              \n  $100,000               non-employee         \n                         director             \n  $50,000                \u2022\u2002\u200aLead Director     \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aChair of the      \n                         Audit Committee \u2022\u2002\u200a  \n  $45,000                Chair of the Risk    \n                         Committee \u2022\u2002\u200aChair   \n                         of the Technology    \n                         Committee            \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aChair of the      \n                         Compensation and     \n                         Human Capital        \n  $30,000                Committee \u2022\u2002\u200aChair   \n                         of the Nominating    \n                         and Governance       \n                         Committee            \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aChair of the      \n  $20,000                Truist Bank Trust    \n                         Committee            \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aAll non-chair     \n  $15,000                members of the       \n                         Audit and Risk       \n                         Committees           \n                                              \nDirector Equity Awards                        \n                                              \n     For 2024 and 2025 service, the Board     \n     approved $180,000 in equity-based        \n  \u2022  compensation, issued in the form of      \n     RSUs that 100% vest at the end of the    \n     year in which they are granted (subject  \n     to deferral as described below).         \n                                              \n                                              \n     If Board service is terminated due to    \n     disability or death, all unvested RSUs   \n  \u2022  granted to a non-employee director       \n     fully vest as of the date of disability  \n     or death.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     If Board service is terminated for any   \n  \u2022  other reason, all unvested RSUs          \n     outstanding as of the date of            \n     termination are forfeited.               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Upon a change of control, all unvested   \n     RSUs become fully vested, and a          \n  \u2022  corresponding number of shares of        \n     Truist common stock would be issuable    \n     to each director holding such RSUs.      \n                                              \nNon-EmployeeDirectors\u2019 Deferred Compensation  \nPlan. The Truist Amended and Restated Non-    \nEmployeeDirectors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan \npermits participating non-employeedirectors to\ndefer 50% or 100% of their retainer fees into \na deferred savings account as well as 100% of \ntheir equity compensation awards.             \nParticipating non-employeedirectors make an   \nelection upon entering the plan regarding the \ndeferral of their non-employeedirector fees   \nand equity compensation awards and the form of\ndistributions under the plan. Deferrals of    \nretainer fees are fully vested at all times   \nand are payable in cash after termination of  \nthe director\u2019s service on the Board. Deferred \nequity awards are payable in Truist shares    \nafter termination of a director\u2019s service on  \nthe Board. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Truist \nrequires each non-employeedirector to hold or \ncontrol an amount of common stock having a    \nvalue equal to at least 5x the amount of his  \nor her annual cash retainer paid by Truist for\nsuch director\u2019s services. All non-            \nemployeedirectors are expected to meet this   \nownership requirement by the later of (i) five\nyears following initial appointment as a      \ndirector, or (ii) such period of time as it   \nmay take to reach the ownership requirement   \nthreshold by holding shares or RSUs granted by\nTruist pursuant to the                        \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    19  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nProposal 1\u2014Election of Directors equity       \ncompensation arrangements for directors.

The    \nCorporate Governance Guidelines address a     \nnumber of matters applicable to directors,    \nincluding director qualification standards,   \ndirector independence requirements, share     \nownership guidelines, Board responsibilities, \nBoard development, role of the independent    \nLead Director, retirement, meetings of non-   \nmanagementdirectors, and director             \ncompensation. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Our Board \nof Directors is committed to maintaining      \nobjective, independent oversight of           \nmanagement. The value we place on the         \nindependence of our directors is reflected in \nour corporate governance documents, Board     \ncommittee charters, annual independence review\nof our Board members, and the role of our Lead\nDirector. In determining director             \nindependence, our Board considers the New York\nStock Exchange\u2019s (\u201cNYSE\u201d) independence        \ncriteria and the standards set forth in our   \nCorporate Governance Guidelines. Consistent   \nwith NYSE rules, our Board of Directors       \nbroadly considers all relevant facts and      \ncircumstances that bear on the materiality of \neach director\u2019s relationship with Truist,     \nincluding the potential for conflicts of      \ninterest, when determining director           \nindependence. In making an independence       \ndetermination, no director qualifies as       \nindependent unless the Board affirmatively    \ndetermines that the director has no material  \nrelationship, and has not had such a          \nrelationship within the past three years, with\nTruist or any of its subsidiaries.            \n                                \n  22    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance                          \nTo assist it in making                        \nindependence                                  \ndeterminations, our                           \nBoard of Directors has                        \nadopted categorical                           \nstandards, which are                          \ncontained in our                              \nCorporate Governance                          \nGuidelines.

After duly considering all such       \ninformation, our Board of Directors has       \naffirmatively determined that the following   \ncurrent directors or nominees have no         \ndisqualifying material relationships with     \nTruist or its subsidiaries and are            \nindependent:                                  \n                                              \n  \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009       \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009        \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009       \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009      \n  Jennif\u2026    Dallas\u00a0     Charles    Bruce\u00a0L.  \n  S.\u00a0        S.\u00a0         A.\u00a0        Tanner    \n  Banner     Clement     Patton               \n  \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009K.     \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009        \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009       \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009      \n  David      Linnie\u00a0     Thomas\u00a0    Steven\u00a0   \n  Boyer,     M.\u00a0         E.\u00a0        C.\u00a0       \n  Jr.        Haynesw\u2026    Skains     Voorhees  \n  \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009       \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009        \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009                 \n  Agnes\u00a0     Donna\u00a0S.

Rogers, Jr. was deemed not to be   \nindependent due to his role as a current      \nexecutive officer of Truist. The Board also   \ndetermined that Christine Sears and Patrick C.\nGraney III, who each retired during 2024, were\nindependent. Each member of the Audit         \nCommittee, the Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee, and the Nominating and Governance  \nCommittee has been determined by the Board to \nbe independent in accordance with the         \nrequirements of the NYSE, SEC, and our        \nCorporate Governance Guidelines. The SEC and  \nthe NYSE also have established standards      \nrelating to audit committee membership and    \nfunctions. With regard to such membership     \nstandards, the Board has determined that      \nJennifer S. Banner, Dallas S. Clement, Bruce  \nL. Tanner, and Steven C. Voorhees meet the    \nrequirements of an \u201caudit committee financial \nexpert\u201d as defined by the SEC.

Prior to the resignation becoming  \neffective, the Board, through the Nominating  \nand Governance Committee, will review any such\nchange and determine the appropriateness of   \nthe director\u2019s continued membership on the    \nBoard. SERVICE ON OTHER BOARDS A director must\nadvise the Chairman of the Board and the Chair\nof the Nominating and Governance Committee    \nbefore accepting an invitation to serve on    \nanother public or private company board. If   \nthe invitation is to serve on another public  \ncompany board, the Nominating and Governance  \nCommittee will review whether such board      \nservice may unduly impact the ability of the  \ndirector to fulfill his or her                \nresponsibilities as a director of Truist and  \nmust approve such board service before the    \ndirector accepts the additional position. A   \nnon-employeedirector of Truist may not serve  \non more than three other public company       \nboards, and a non-employeedirector of Truist  \nwho is also the chief executive officer of    \nanother public company may not serve on more  \nthan one other public company board. In       \naddition, Audit Committee members shall not   \nsimultaneously serve on the audit committees  \nof more than a total of three public          \ncompanies, unless the Board approves such     \nadditional service before the director accepts\nthe additional audit committee position.      \nExecutive officers of Truist may serve on one \npublic company board, in addition to the      \nTruist Board, with the approval of the Chief  \nExecutive Officer or, in the case of the Chief\nExecutive Officer, the Nominating and         \nGovernance Committee. BOARD DEVELOPMENT Our   \nBoard Development Program is designed to      \nsupport the directors in their continuing     \neducation and the performance of their        \nresponsibilities as members of the Board and  \nBoard committees. The Board Development       \nProgram allows directors to supplement their  \nexisting skill sets and stay informed of      \nemerging risks and trends in Truist\u2019s business\nand the broader financial services industry in\ngeneral. The Board, through formal annual     \npolling and informal requests throughout the  \nyear, identifies areas of focus for           \ndevelopment opportunities. Programs and       \ncourses are provided by both in-houseexperts  \nand outside advisors on a wide range of topics\nto enhance the directors\u2019 knowledge in areas  \nimportant in carrying out their               \nresponsibilities as directors.                \n                                \n  24    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance To facilitate awareness  \nof outside learning opportunities, Truist     \nmakes available to directors a calendar of    \nrelevant programs. Management reports annually\nto the Nominating and Governance Committee    \nwith respect to completed development activity\nover the past year and plans for future       \ndevelopment opportunities. Newly elected      \ndirectors undergo an extensive director       \norientation process. We view the director     \norientation process as a means to acquaint    \nnewly elected directors with our culture,     \nbusinesses, operations, corporate governance, \nand risk-management framework and also to     \nfurther their understanding of Truist\u2019s       \ncompetitive position within the broader       \nfinancial-services industry. Additionally,    \ndirectors newly appointed to any of the       \nBoard\u2019s committees are offered an orientation \nto the committee and its duties and           \noperations. BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE SELF-   \nASSESSMENTS Cadence and Process On an annual  \nbasis, the Board and its committees evaluate  \ntheir performance and other attributes of     \ntheir effectiveness. The Nominating and       \nGovernance Committee is responsible for       \noverseeing these self-assessments and         \nrecommends a process for approval by the      \nBoard. In 2024 the process included written   \nsurveys that were completed by the members of \nthe Board and each committee and one-on-      \noneinterviews by the Chairman with each       \ndirector. Topics The self-assessments are     \ndesigned to support the Board and its         \ncommittees in adapting their structures and   \npractices as opportunities for enhancement are\nidentified and as Truist\u2019s size, scope of     \noperations, risk profile, and other           \ncharacteristics change over time. Topics      \ncovered in the Board\u2019s self-assessments       \ngenerally include:                            \n                                  \n  \u2022  strategy and risk appetite;  \n                                  \n                                              \n  \u2022  management succession and                \n     accountability;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  information needs and director           \n     development;                             \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u2022  stature of independent functions; and  \n                                            \n                                              \n  \u2022  Board composition and governance         \n     structure.                               \n                                              \nTopics covered in the assessments of the      \nBoard\u2019s committees generally include:         \n                         \n  \u2022  general oversight;  \n                         \n                                 \n  \u2022  management accountability;  \n                                 \n                             \n  \u2022  information needs; and  \n                             \n                                              \n  \u2022  committee composition and governance     \n     structure.                               \n                                              \nReporting and Action Items Results of the     \nself-assessments are discussed by the         \ndirectors in executive sessions and, as       \nappropriate, are conveyed to senior management\nto improve oversight by the Board and its     \ncommittees. For example, based in part on     \nprevious self-assessments, enhancements have  \nbeen made to meeting agendas and materials,   \nopportunities for director development, and   \nprocesses for management succession planning. \nSUCCESSION PLANNING AT TRUIST Human capital   \nmanagement and talent development are a       \npriority for the Board of Directors. Our      \nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that  \nthe Board of Directors is responsible for     \noverseeing an executive officer succession    \nplan, including procedures for Chief Executive\nOfficer selection in the event of an emergency\nor the retirement of the Chief Executive      \nOfficer. On the recommendation of the         \nNominating and Governance Committee, the Board\nof Directors has adopted a resolution         \nregarding emergency succession for the Chief  \nExecutive Officer. The Lead Director          \nfacilitates the Board\u2019s regular review and    \nevaluation of our executive officer succession\nplan. As part of the plan, our Chairman and   \nChief Executive Officer evaluates and         \nrecommends potential successors, along with a \nreview of any development plans of such       \nindividuals.                                  \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    25  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance Board Leadership         \nStructure CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF     \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER Our Board of Directors is   \nled by the Chairman. Under our bylaws, the    \nChairman is elected by the Board and presides \nover each Board meeting and performs such     \nother duties as may be incident to the office \nof Chairman. Our bylaws and Corporate         \nGovernance Guidelines each provide that the   \nChairman may also hold the position of Chief  \nExecutive Officer. Truist\u2019s Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer is not permitted to serve as\na member of any standing Board committee,     \nother than the Executive Committee, the Risk  \nCommittee, or the Technology Committee. Our   \nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that  \nwhen the position of Chairman of the Board is \nnot held by an independent director, the Board\nwill appoint an independent Lead Director. It \nis the Board\u2019s current belief that having a   \nunified Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  \nis appropriate and in the best interests of   \nTruist and its shareholders. The Board        \nbelieves that combining the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer roles at this time provides \nthe following advantages to us:               \n                                              \n     our Chief Executive Officer is more      \n     familiar with our current business and   \n  \u2022  industry than our non-management         \n     directors and is best situated to lead   \n     discussions on important matters         \n     affecting the business of Truist;        \n                                              \n                                              \n     combining the Chief Executive Officer    \n     and Chairman positions, along with a     \n     strong partnership with the independent  \n  \u2022  Lead Director, creates a firm link       \n     between management and the Board and     \n     promotes both the development and        \n     implementation of corporate strategy;    \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     combining the roles of Chief Executive   \n     Officer and Chairman contributes to a    \n  \u2022  more efficient and effective Board,      \n     promotes unity of vision for the         \n     Company, and avoids potential conflict   \n     among directors.                         \n                                              \nThe Board is aware of the potential issues    \nthat may arise when an insider chairs the     \nboard of a public company but believes these  \nare more than offset by existing safeguards,  \nwhich include the designation of a strong     \nindependent Lead Director with a clearly      \ndefined role and authority set forth in our   \nCorporate Governance Guidelines and discussed \nfurther below. In addition, our Board         \nregularly meets in executive session, chaired \nby the independent Lead Director, with the    \nindependent directors outside the presence of \nmanagement. Further, only our independent     \ndirectors are involved in meetings to discuss \nsuccession planning and Chief Executive       \nOfficer compensation. The Board believes its  \napproach to risk oversight, as more fully     \ndiscussed below under \u201cRisk Oversight,\u201d       \nenables the Board to choose the appropriate   \nleadership structure while continuing to      \neffectively oversee risk. INDEPENDENT LEAD    \nDIRECTOR Effective March 12, 2022, Thomas E.  \nSkains was appointed as the Board\u2019s           \nindependent Lead Director, subject to the     \nrotation policy for Lead Director service as  \nset forth in our Corporate Governance         \nGuidelines. Our Corporate Governance          \nGuidelines require that our Lead Director (i) \nbe appointed by a majority vote of the        \nindependent directors and (ii) serve in such  \ncapacity for an initial two-yearterm (subject \nto annual election as a director by the       \nshareholders), and may serve for subsequent   \none-yearterm(s) at the discretion of the      \nBoard. Mr. Skains\u2019 term as Lead Director was  \nrecently extended by the Board until March 12,\n2026. Our Board believes that the Lead        \nDirector serves an important corporate        \ngovernance function by providing strong,      \nindependent leadership for the non-           \nmanagementdirectors and provides an           \nappropriate balance to the Chairman and Chief \nExecutive Officer. In addition to the formal  \nlist of duties performed by our Lead Director \nas set forth in our Corporate Governance      \nGuidelines, he also meets with regulators,    \nsupports shareholder engagement, and attends  \nmeetings with senior management. A more       \ncomplete description of the role of our Lead  \nDirector is included in our Corporate         \nGovernance Guidelines and in the discussion   \nabove under \u201cStanding Board Committee         \nMembership and Lead Director                  \nResponsibilities.\u201d Director Refreshment As one\nof its primary responsibilities, the          \nNominating and Governance Committee routinely \nevaluates the size, composition, and structure\nof the Board. When refreshment may be         \nbeneficial, the Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee conducts a thoughtful evaluation and\nvetting process before recommending a         \ncandidate for Board membership. During the    \nprocess, the Nominating and Governance        \nCommittee considers factors such as the       \ncandidate\u2019s background, skills, and expertise,\nany additional characteristics that would best\ncomplement the current Board composition, the \nstrategic priorities of the Company, and any  \npotential conflicts of interest. The          \nNominating and Governance Committee has been  \nactively engaged in the refreshment process in\nrecent years. In October 2023, Truist         \nannounced changes to the Board, including a   \nreduction in the size of the Board from 21 to \n13 directors effective January 1, 2024. The   \nNominating and Governance Committee\u2019s         \nrefreshment efforts also resulted in Laurence \nStein\u2019s nomination and election to the Board  \nat the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.   \nMr. Stein brings valuable experience to the   \nBoard in financial services and financial risk\nmanagement as he retired in late 2023 after   \nserving for many years in various senior      \nexecutive roles with a large, complex         \nfinancial                                     \n                                \n  26    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance institution. With the    \naddition of Mr. Stein and two additional      \ndirector retirements in 2024, the Board now   \nhas 12 directors. Of these 12 directors,      \nseveral have broad experience in regulatory   \nstrategy and compliance, including directors  \nwho have served as (i) a former regional      \ndirector with the Consumer Financial          \nProtection Bureau and as Chief Compliance and \nPrivacy Officer for two major financial       \ninstitutions, (ii) CEO of a regional bank, and\n(iii) CEO of a major natural gas utility. Each\nof these directors has experience in leading  \nbusinesses or operations in a regulated       \nenvironment and interacting with regulatory   \nagencies. Several directors also have direct  \nexperience managing capital and liquidity. In \naddition to the directors with CEO experience \nmentioned above, the Board also includes      \ndirectors who serve or have served as (i) CFO \nof a major aerospace, defense, information    \nsecurity, and technology corporation, (ii) CEO\nand CFO of a multinational manufacturer of    \npaper and packaging products, and (iii)       \nPresident and CFO of a large media,           \ntechnology, and communications conglomerate.  \nIn these roles, the directors have overseen   \nthe capital structure of their companies and  \nmanaged liquidity planning and analysis.      \nNominating and Governance Committee Director  \nNominations The Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee is responsible for identifying and  \nrecommending to the Board nominees for        \nelection or reelection as directors. We seek  \nas director candidates individuals who possess\ngood business acumen, strength of character,  \nand an independent mind, as well as a         \nreputation for integrity and the highest      \npersonal and professional ethics in order to  \nmost effectively serve the long-term interests\nof Truist and its shareholders. The Nominating\nand Governance Committee considers candidates \nsubmitted by directors and third-party search \nfirms hired for identifying director          \ncandidates. The Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee also considers candidates           \nrecommended by shareholders. Director         \ncandidates, including those recommended by    \nshareholders, will be evaluated using the     \ndirector membership criteria described below. \nThe Board considers the Nominating and        \nGovernance Committee\u2019s recommendations when   \nappointing directors and selecting director   \nnominees to be submitted to shareholders for  \nelection at the annual meeting of             \nshareholders. DIRECTOR MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA A  \ndirector candidate is nominated to stand for  \nelection based on his or her professional     \nexperience, strategic insights, recognized    \nachievement in his or her respective field, an\nability to contribute to our business,        \nexperience in risk management, and the        \nwillingness to make the commitment of time and\neffort required of a Truist director over an  \nextended period of time. A director must be   \n\u201cfinancially literate\u201d and should understand  \nthe intricacies of a public company. A        \ndirector should possess good business acumen, \nstrength of character, and an independent     \nmind, as well as a reputation for integrity   \nand the highest personal and professional     \nethics. Other factors are also considered in  \nthe context of assessing the overall          \ncomposition of the Board. An important goal of\nthe Board, pursued through the Nominating and \nGovernance Committee, is to recruit and retain\ndirectors who possess a broad array of skills,\nbackgrounds, and expertise, that, taken as a  \nwhole, create a strong and effective governing\nbody. The Nominating and Governance Committee \nannually assesses these factors in the        \ndirector selection and nomination process.    \nDIRECTOR CANDIDATES RECOMMENDED BY            \nSHAREHOLDERS The Board of Directors will      \nconsider qualified director nominees          \nrecommended by shareholders. Those            \nrecommendations should be sent in writing to  \nthe Corporate Secretary, Truist Financial     \nCorporation, 214 N. Tryon Street, 43rd Floor, \nMail Code 500-93-43-13,Charlotte, North       \nCarolina 28202. The Nominating and Governance \nCommittee will evaluate director candidates   \nrecommended by shareholders using the director\nmembership criteria described above. Majority \nVoting and Director Resignation Policy Our    \narticles of incorporation require each        \ndirector to be elected by the majority of the \nvotes cast at a meeting of shareholders. Under\nNorth Carolina law, an incumbent director who \nfails to receive a majority of votes cast for \nhis or her reelection remains in office until \nthe director\u2019s successor is elected and       \nqualified, the size of the Board is reduced,  \nor the director resigns or is otherwise       \nremoved. Our current Director Resignation     \nPolicy addresses this \u201choldover\u201d issue by     \nrequiring any director who does not receive   \nthe requisite affirmative majority of the     \nvotes cast for his or her reelection to tender\nhis or her resignation to the Board. Under our\nDirector Resignation Policy, as described in  \nour Corporate Governance Guidelines, any      \nincumbent director nominee who fails to       \nreceive more votes in favor of the director\u2019s \nelection than against the director\u2019s election \nshall tender his or her resignation to the    \nBoard, which will be conditioned on the       \nBoard\u2019s acceptance of the resignation. The    \nNominating and Governance Committee will then \nconsider all of the relevant facts and        \ncircumstances and recommend to the Board      \nwhether to accept, reject, or otherwise act   \nwith respect to the tendered resignation. The \nBoard will act on the Nominating and          \nGovernance Committee\u2019s recommendation within  \n90 days following certification of the        \nshareholder vote and will publicly disclose   \nits decision within this 90-day timeframe. A  \ndirector whose resignation is under           \nconsideration will abstain from participating \nin any recommendation or decision regarding   \nthat resignation. If a director\u2019s resignation \nis not accepted, the director will continue to\nserve until the next annual meeting of        \nshareholders and until the director\u2019s         \nsuccessor is elected and qualified, or until  \nthe director\u2019s earlier resignation or removal.\n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    27  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance Related Person           \nTransactions The Board, acting through the    \nNominating and Governance Committee, approves \nor ratifies related person transactions in    \naccordance with the Related Person            \nTransactions Policy. The term \u201crelated person \ntransaction,\u201d under the Related Person        \nTransactions Policy, generally means a        \ntransaction in which Truist was, is, or will  \nbe a participant, the amount involved exceeds \n$120,000, and in which a related person has,  \nhad, or will have a direct or indirect        \nmaterial interest. A \u201crelated person\u201d under   \nthe Related Person Transactions Policy        \ngenerally means any person who was in any of  \nthe following categories: (i) at any time     \nduring the relevant period for disclosure of  \nrelated person transactions, (a) a director,  \ndirector nominee, or executive officer of     \nTruist, or (b) an immediate family member of  \nany of the foregoing, and (ii) at any time    \nwhen a transaction in which the person had a  \ndirect or indirect material interest occurred \nor existed, (a) a beneficial owner of more    \nthan five percent of any class of the         \nCompany\u2019s voting securities, and (b) any      \nimmediate family member of any such beneficial\nowner. An immediate family member is, for any \nperson, the person\u2019s child, stepchild, parent,\nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law,   \nfather-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,   \nbrother-in-law,or sister-in-law\u2014including,in  \neach case, adoptive relationships\u2014and any     \nperson (other than a tenant or employee)      \nsharing the household of the person. As       \nprovided in the Related Person Transactions   \nPolicy, any charitable contribution in excess \nof $5 million made by Truist to any charitable\nor non-profitorganization of which a director \nor executive officer of Truist serves as a    \ndirector, trustee, executive officer, advisory\nboard member, or in any similar leadership    \ncapacity and that is not a related person     \ntransaction must be approved by the Nominating\nand Governance Committee. Further, charitable \ncontributions between $500,000 and $5 million \nto such organizations that are not related    \nperson transactions must be reported at the   \nnext Nominating and Governance Committee      \nmeeting. A number of our directors, executive \nofficers, and their affiliates utilize certain\nproducts and services offered by Truist,      \nincluding personal and corporate banking,     \nsecurities brokerage, investment advisory, and\nwealth management services, in the ordinary   \ncourse of our business. Since January 1, 2024,\nother than as described below, there have been\nno related person transactions that were      \nrequired either to be approved or ratified    \nunder our Related Person Transactions Policy  \nor reported under the SEC\u2019s related person    \ntransaction rules. Based on information       \ncontained in separate Schedule 13G/A or Form  \n13F-HRfilings with the SEC, each of BlackRock,\nInc., Capital International Investors, and    \nVanguard Group, Inc. reported that it (or its \naffiliates) beneficially owned or had         \ninvestment discretion over more than 5% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock as of  \nDecember 31, 2024. During 2024, we, and our   \naffiliates, engaged in transactions in the    \nordinary course of business with BlackRock,   \nCapital International Investors, and Vanguard \n(or their respective affiliates), including   \nsales of debt securities of the Company in    \npublic offerings of those securities, sales of\nfixed income and equity securities by our     \ninstitutional broker-dealer subsidiary, and,  \nin the case of BlackRock, the licensing of a  \ntechnology solution that is embedded in       \nTruist\u2019s robo-advisor application, Truist     \nInvest, to process and rebalance client       \ninvestment portfolios. Such transactions were \non substantially the same terms as those      \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \ntransactions with unrelated third parties.    \nShareholder Engagement Program GENERAL        \nTruist\u2019s shareholder engagement program is a  \nrobust, year-round process, incorporating     \nanalysis of results of our annual shareholder \nmeeting, key topics of importance to our      \nshareholders, and Board deliberations. We     \nlisten closely to our shareholders to         \nunderstand their views on a variety of topics,\nincluding our executive compensation and      \ncorporate governance programs, as well as     \ncorporate responsibility and sustainability   \nissues involving the Company. At Truist, our  \nshareholder engagement program is designed to \nencompass a dialogue with our shareholders on \nseveral levels, including:                    \n                                              \n  \u2022  Periodic telephonic meetings with our    \n     larger institutional shareholders;       \n                                              \n                                              \n     In-person, or virtual, meetings with     \n  \u2022  institutional shareholder                \n     representatives as requested;            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Responses to shareholder                 \n     correspondence;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Dialogue with proponents of shareholder  \n     proposals; and                           \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u2022  Engagement with proxy advisory firms.  \n                                            \nTruist\u2019s Nominating and Governance Committee  \nis responsible for overseeing our shareholder \nengagement program, which includes meetings   \nwith our largest shareholders led by senior   \nmanagement and, in certain cases, our         \nindependent Lead Director or Chair of the     \nNominating and Governance Committee.

We invited each of these  \nshareholders to a call with representatives   \nfrom the Company, including our independent   \nLead Director or Chair of our Nominating and  \nGovernance Committee in instances in which the\nshareholder held more than 1% of our          \noutstanding shares. The Truist team met with  \n12 shareholders during our fall 2024          \nengagement. Topics discussed at the meetings  \nwith these shareholders included (i) corporate\ngovernance, (ii) executive compensation, (iii)\ncorporate responsibility and sustainability,  \n(iv) cybersecurity, (v) political             \ncontributions and lobbying, and (vi) human    \ncapital management. Following these calls,    \nsenior management reviewed shareholder        \nfeedback with the Nominating and Governance   \nCommittee and other Board committees as       \nappropriate. Senior management, the Nominating\nand Governance Committee, and the Board will  \ncontinue to take that feedback into           \nconsideration, along with feedback from       \nshareholders received outside of our fall     \noutreach effort and peer practices, when      \nplanning future company policies, practices,  \nand disclosures in public filings. The Board  \nand senior management endeavor to listen,     \nconsider, and respond to the results of our   \nshareholder engagement process throughout the \nyear in shaping the goals and objectives of   \nTruist.

This is consistent with our     \npurpose to inspire and build better lives and \ncommunities. Corporate responsibility and     \nsustainability programs are expressed through \nactivities like investments in communities and\ninnovative technologies as well as responsible\nbusiness practices and sound governance. We   \ncollaborate with commercial clients of all    \nsizes and across all industries as they set   \nand achieve their sustainability goals.

GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND   \nOVERSIGHT The Board oversees corporate        \nresponsibility and sustainability programs,   \nrisks, and disclosures. The Nominating and    \nGovernance Committee is the primary committee \nresponsible for oversight of corporate        \nresponsibility and sustainability matters,    \nincluding reporting and, along with the Audit \nCommittee, disclosure practices. As needed,   \nother Board committees receive updates on     \ncorporate responsibility and sustainability   \nmatters that relate directly to their         \nresponsibilities. For example, the            \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee      \nreceives updates on human capital management  \nstrategies and initiatives, and the Risk      \nCommittee reviews Truist\u2019s climate-related    \nrisks and risk-management practices. The full \nBoard also receives updates on key programs,  \naccomplishments, and plans. Management        \ncommittees support the Board committees in    \ntheir oversight of corporate responsibility   \nand sustainability matters. The Corporate     \nResponsibility and Sustainability Committee,  \nwhich reports to the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, is composed of internal leaders who\nguide related public affairs and              \ncommunications, disclosures and reporting,    \noperational sustainability, and sustainable   \nfinance activities. The Disclosure Committee  \nreports to the Audit Committee and reviews our\nprincipal corporate responsibility and        \nsustainability disclosures prior to           \npublication.                                  \n                                \n  30    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance CURRENT PRACTICES AND    \nACCOMPLISHMENTS In expressing our purpose, we \nmake investments that strengthen the          \ncommunities where we live and work and conduct\nbusiness in an ethical and responsible way.   \nCorporate Responsibility and Sustainability   \nReporting Practices As a responsible corporate\ncitizen, we disclose our performance and      \nprogress on corporate responsibility and      \nsustainability metrics consistent with        \ngenerally accepted voluntary reporting        \nframeworks.

Complaints or concerns        \nregarding these matters are referred to our   \nChief Legal Officer, who is responsible for   \nassessing and, if reasonably possible and     \nappropriate in the judgment of the Chief Legal\nOfficer, overseeing the investigation of      \nreported matters. The Audit Committee         \nperiodically reviews and recommends changes to\nthis policy and receives reports on both non- \nsubstantiatedand substantiated matters. Risk  \nOversight Truist seeks to maintain a          \ncomprehensive ERM Framework supported by      \npeople, processes, and systems to identify,   \nmeasure, monitor, manage, and report on       \nsignificant risks arising from exposures and  \nbusiness activities. Truist\u2019s ERM Framework is\ndesigned to promote the execution of strategic\ngoals and objectives in alignment with        \nTruist\u2019s risk appetite to realize its Purpose,\nMission, and Values. We place significant     \nemphasis on risk management and maintain a    \nseparate Board-level Risk Committee, which    \nplays a key risk oversight role within our ERM\nFramework. Among its responsibilities, the    \nRisk Committee monitors our policies,         \nprograms, and plans established by management \nto identify, measure, monitor, assess, manage,\nand report on risks arising from Truist\u2019s     \nexposures and business activities. The Risk   \nManagement Organization (\u201cRMO\u201d) is led by the \nChief Risk Officer and is responsible for     \noverseeing (i) the establishment and          \nmonitoring of enterprise-wide risk limits,    \n(ii) the implementation and ongoing compliance\nwith risk management policies, procedures,    \nprocesses, and systems, and (iii) the         \nmanagement of risks, controls, monitoring, and\ntesting. The Chief Risk Officer chairs the    \nEnterprise Risk Committee, which provides     \noversight based on an integrated view of risks\nacross our organization, including strategic, \ncompliance, credit, liquidity, market,        \noperational, technology, and reputational     \nrisks, and is responsible for escalating and  \nresolving risk management concerns and        \nreporting emerging risks to the Risk          \nCommittee. The ERM Framework is supported by  \nthree lines of defense to manage risk as      \nfollows.                                      \n                                              \n     First Line of Defense. Consisting of     \n     the Business Unit Risk Owners (\u201cBU Risk  \n     Owners\u201d) and the Governance and          \n     Controls Organization (\u201cGCO\u201d),           \n     teammates in the first line of defense   \n     operate at the point where risks         \n     originate\u2013either through serving         \n     clients directly or providing            \n     functional services and support. BU      \n     Risk Owners are responsible for risks    \n  \u2022  within their business, including the     \n     identification, escalation, mitigation,  \n     and management of risks. The GCO         \n     standardizes first-line risk execution   \n     and ownership across the Company in      \n     partnership with the business units and  \n     enterprise functions. As part of the     \n     first-line of defense, the GCO provides  \n     risk advice and oversight, issues        \n     management, testing, reporting, and      \n     business continuity expertise to         \n     first-line execution efforts.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Second Line of Defense. The second line  \n     of defense provides independent risk     \n     management, oversight, and challenge of  \n     the first line of defense. The second    \n  \u2022  line of defense resides within the RMO,  \n     which establishes policies and           \n     procedures to guide and oversee the      \n     execution of ERM Framework requirements  \n     across Truist and independently          \n     identify and escalate issues.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Third Line of Defense. Truist Audit      \n     Services (Truist\u2019s internal audit        \n     function) provides independent and       \n     objective assurance for Truist by        \n  \u2022  evaluating the design and effectiveness  \n     of risk management activities,           \n     oversight, and challenge. Results are    \n     reported to senior management and the    \n     Board of Directors according to the      \n     Audit Services Policy.                   \n                                              \n                                \n  32    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance Strategic Direction and  \nPlanning One of the Board\u2019s most important    \nresponsibilities is to provide oversight,     \nguidance, and direction with respect to       \nTruist\u2019s Corporate Strategic Plan (\u201cStrategic \nPlan\u201d). The Strategic Plan is designed to     \ntranslate the Company\u2019s Purpose, Mission, and \nValues into actionable priorities which       \nprovide direction for Truist. The Company\u2019s   \nstrategic planning process: (i) includes an   \nindependent risk evaluation to confirm that   \nstrategic activities are consistent with the  \nBoard-approved risk appetite (including       \ncorresponding limits and warning thresholds); \n(ii) reflects alignment with Truist\u2019s capital \nplanning; and (iii) takes into consideration  \nenterprise objectives, corresponding business \nunit objectives, and operating plans. Board   \ninput on these factors informs management\u2019s   \nupdates to the Strategic Plan, which are      \ngenerally presented to the Board for adoption \non an annual basis. The resulting Strategic   \nPlan guides Truist\u2019s activities for the       \napplicable years, and implementation of the   \nStrategic Plan is monitored by the Enterprise \nStrategy and Execution Committee and the      \nBoard. The Board also approves the annual     \nProfit Plan, which is a detailed one-         \nyearfinancial plan that outlines our goals for\ngenerating revenue, managing expenses, and    \nmaintaining a strong framework for managing   \ncapital, liquidity, interest rate, and credit \nrisk. After the sale of the Company\u2019s         \nremaining interest in Truist Insurance        \nHoldings, LLC (\u201cTIH\u201d), which was completed    \nduring the second quarter of 2024, the Board  \nrevised the Company\u2019s Strategic Plan and the  \nProfit Plan to reflect the TIH sale and       \nsubsequent strategic balance sheet            \nrepositioning, including removing TIH         \nearnings, incorporating discontinued          \noperations accounting related to the TIH sale,\nand adding net interest income from the       \nreinvestment of proceeds from the TIH sale and\nbalance sheet repositioning. These adjustments\nwere necessary to provide a more accurate     \nrepresentation of the Company\u2019s expected      \nfinancial performance for the 2024 fiscal     \nyear. For purposes of this proxy statement, we\nrefer to the initially-approved Profit Plan   \nfor 2024 as the \u201cOriginal Plan\u201d and the       \nrevised Profit Plan as the \u201cFinal Plan.\u201d      \nInformation Security/Cybersecurity Like other \nfinancial services firms, Truist faces an     \nincreasingly complex and evolving             \ncybersecurity threat environment. We maintain \na risk-based cybersecurity framework that is  \npart of our ERM Framework. It is implemented  \nthrough people, processes, and technology,    \nwhereby we assess, identify, and manage       \nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats and \nseek to adapt our risk mitigation activities  \naccordingly. Our Board has primary            \nresponsibility for the oversight of our       \nenterprise risk management and exercises its  \noversight function in respect of cybersecurity\nrisk through the Risk Committee. The Risk     \nCommittee is responsible for overseeing       \nTruist\u2019s risk management function, including  \napproving and reviewing Truist\u2019s risk         \nmanagement framework and policies, and        \noverseeing management\u2019s implementation of such\nframework and policies. Our information       \nsecurity program, which specifies how we      \nexecute our cybersecurity framework, is       \noperated and maintained by management,        \nincluding the Chief Information Officer, the  \nChief Information Security Officer, and the   \nChief Risk Officer. These senior officers are \nresponsible for assessing and managing        \nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity risks. Our information \nsecurity program also includes processes for  \nescalating and considering the materiality of \nincidents that impact Truist, including       \nescalation to executive management and the    \nBoard, which are periodically tested through  \ntabletop exercises to assess Truist\u2019s         \npreparedness. Our cybersecurity framework     \nstrategy, which is overseen by the Chief      \nInformation Security Officer, is informed by  \nvarious risk and control assessments, control \ntesting, external assessments, threat         \nintelligence, and public and private          \ninformation sharing. For more information on  \nour management of cybersecurity risks, please \nsee the \u201cCybersecurity\u201d section of our Annual \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December\n31, 2024. Statement of Political Engagement   \nOur executive officers have direct            \nresponsibility for our political activities,  \nwhile our Nominating and Governance Committee \noversees the Company\u2019s policies and practices \nrelating to political contributions and       \nlobbying. A copy of Truist\u2019s Statement of     \nPolitical Engagement may be obtained from our \ninvestor relations website (                  \nhttps://ir.truist.com). Truist participates in\npolicy debates on issues to support our       \ninterests. Truist does not use corporate funds\nto contribute to federal, state, or local     \npolitical candidates, political parties, or   \npolitical committees organized for the        \nadvancement of a political candidate,         \nincluding super political action committees,  \nor otherwise employ its resources, including  \nin-kindresources, for the benefit of any of   \nthe foregoing. In some cases, Truist may      \ncontribute corporate funds to 501(c) tax-     \nexemptorganizations that engage in advocacy   \nand education to promote a robust financial   \nservices industry and a vibrant, growing      \neconomy. Truist may also occasionally make    \ncorporate contributions to ballot measure     \ncommittees where permitted by law. Truist     \ndiscloses any ballot measure contributions in \nits annual political contributions reporting. \nAs part of Truist\u2019s involvement in the public \npolicy process, Truist regularly expresses its\nviews on policy matters to elected officials  \nand their staff, as well as the principals and\nstaff of various regulatory organizations.    \nTruist generally does not engage in grassroots\nlobbying, which consists of directly          \ncommunicating with the public advocating      \naction with respect to specific legislation.  \nIf Truist does engage in grassroots lobbying, \nTruist will disclose such activity where and  \nas required by law. Truist sponsors nonprofit,\nunincorporated political action committees    \n(\u201cPACs\u201d), which allow directors and teammates \nto voluntarily pool their financial resources \nto support federal and state candidates who   \ndrive policies to help financial institutions \ncontinue to innovate,                         \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    33  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCorporate Governance serve our communities,   \nand advance the success and prosperity of our \nclients.

The Audit Committee of the Board\nof Directors is currently composed of four    \nindependent directors and operates under an   \namended and restated charter adopted by the   \nBoard of Directors on December 17, 2024. The  \nprimary duties and responsibilities of the    \nAudit Committee are to assist the Board of    \nDirectors in monitoring: (i) the integrity of \nthe financial statements of the Company; (ii) \ncompliance by the Company with legal and      \nregulatory requirements; (iii) the independent\nregistered public accounting firm\u2019s           \nqualifications and independence; (iv) the     \nCompany\u2019s internal controls and procedures;   \nand (v) the performance of the Company\u2019s      \ninternal audit function and the Company\u2019s     \nindependent auditors. While the Audit         \nCommittee has the duties and responsibilities \nset forth above and those set forth in its    \ncharter, our management is responsible for the\ninternal controls and the financial reporting \nprocess, and the independent registered public\naccounting firm is responsible for performing \nan integrated audit of our financial          \nstatements and of the effectiveness of our    \ninternal control over financial reporting in  \naccordance with standards established by the  \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and \nissuing a report thereon. In the performance  \nof its oversight function, the Audit Committee\nhas performed the duties required by its      \ncharter, including meeting and holding        \ndiscussions with management, the independent  \nregistered public accounting firm, and the    \ninternal auditor, and has reviewed and        \ndiscussed the audited consolidated financial  \nstatements with management and the independent\nregistered public accounting firm. The Audit  \nCommittee has also discussed with the         \nindependent registered public accounting firm \nthe matters required to be discussed by the   \napplicable requirements of the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board and the SEC. In    \naddition, the Audit Committee discussed with  \nthe independent registered public accounting  \nfirm its views on fraud risks and how it      \ndemonstrates its independence. The Audit      \nCommittee has received the written disclosures\nand the letters from the independent          \nregistered public accounting firm stipulated  \nby applicable requirements of the Public      \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board, as        \ncurrently in effect, regarding the independent\nregistered public accounting firm\u2019s           \ncommunications with the Audit Committee       \nconcerning independence, and the Audit        \nCommittee has discussed with the independent  \nregistered public accounting firm its         \nindependence with respect to the Company. The \nAudit Committee also has considered whether   \nthe provision of any non-auditservices by the \nindependent registered public accounting firm \nis compatible with maintaining the            \nindependence of the auditors. Based upon a    \nreview of the reports by, and discussions     \nwith, management and the independent          \nregistered public accounting firm, and the    \nAudit Committee\u2019s review of the               \nrepresentations of management and the Report  \nof the Independent Registered Public          \nAccounting Firm, the Audit Committee          \nrecommended on February 24, 2025 to the Board \nof Directors that the audited financial       \nstatements be included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2024,\nfiled with the SEC on February 25, 2025.      \nSubmitted by the Audit Committee of the Truist\nBoard of Directors as of February 24, 2025:   \n                                              \n  Dallas S.

The       \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee and  \nthe Board believe that our executive-         \ncompensation program, as described in the     \n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis,\u201d       \nreflects a pay-for-performanceculture at      \nTruist that is rooted in our Purpose, Mission,\nand Values. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and the Board also believe that the \nexecutive-compensation program is well        \ndesigned and effective in aligning the        \ninterests of the executives with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders, while          \nminimizing incentives for unnecessary and     \nexcessive risk taking consistent with         \napplicable banking and other laws. In making a\ndecision on whether to approve our executive- \ncompensation program, we ask that you consider\nthe \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis,\u201d   \nthe compensation tables, and the related      \nnarrative disclosures in this proxy statement.\nThe say-on-payadvisory vote is not intended to\naddress any specific item of compensation but \nrather the overall compensation of our named  \nexecutive officers and the compensation       \nphilosophy, policies, and practices described \nin this proxy statement.

Entering    \n2024, senior management and the Board were    \nevaluating the potential for a transformative \nstrategic move through the sale of our        \nremaining interest in TIH and a balance sheet \nrepositioning to replace TIH\u2019s earnings after \nclosing. Due to the significance of these     \ntransactions for Truist and in alignment with \npeer practices, the Committee adopted a       \nstructured scorecard for the Annual Incentive \nPerformance (\u201cAIP\u201d) award program that        \nestablished financial and non-                \nfinancialperformance expectations for senior  \nmanagement within the context of this         \nstrategic transition. See \u201cAnnual Incentive   \nPerformance Awards\u201d beginning on page 46. For \nthe 2024 long-term incentive awards,          \nrecognizing that the sale of TIH would present\ndifficulties in setting quantitative          \nobjectives for return on average common equity\n(\u201cROACE\u201d), the Committee selected absolute and\nrelative adjusted diluted earnings per share  \n(\u201cEPS\u201d)* growth as the performance measures,  \nsubject to minimum capital requirements and a \nrelative total shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d)     \nmodifier, to emphasize core banking growth    \nover the next three years in creating long-   \nterm value for shareholders. See \u201cLong-Term   \nIncentive Awards\u201d beginning on page 51. *     \nRepresents a non-GAAP measure.

With an   \nimplied enterprise valuation of $15.5 billion,\nthis divestiture strengthened Truist\u2019s balance\nsheet by adding 230 basis points of Common    \nEquity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital and increased  \ntangible book value per share (\u201cTBVPS\u201d)* by   \n33%. The transaction and related balance sheet\nrepositioning also created financial          \nflexibility for Truist to decisively pivot to \noffense in its core wholesale- and consumer-  \nbanking businesses. In addition, on June 28,  \n2024, we announced that the Board had         \nauthorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion \nof shares of our common stock through the end \nof 2026 with repurchases expected to begin    \nduring the third quarter. After the successful\ncompletion of these strategic initiatives, the\nCommittee focused on leadership continuity and\ngranted one-timeleadership awards to Messrs.  \nMaguire and Wilson to drive future performance\nand to support continuity. The awards were    \nstructured as Performance Share Units (\u201cPSUs\u201d)\nthat would be earned based on minimum capital \nrequirements and relative TSR performance,    \neach measured over a three-year performance   \nperiod. Our Chairman and CEO did not receive  \nsuch an award. See \u201cOne-TimePerformance-Based \nLeadership Awards\u201d beginning on page 55.      \nHeading into the end of the year, senior      \nmanagement and the Board continued their work \nto further crystallize the strategic aim of   \nour more streamlined and strengthened Truist. \nOur strategic ambition is to build the top    \nsuper-regional bank that grows with our       \nclients through care.

Reviewing 2024, the     \nCommittee noted that senior management had    \nsuccessfully negotiated and executed the      \nhighly challenging sale of TIH and subsequent \nbalance-sheet repositioning without losing    \nbusiness and operational momentum. Adjusted   \npre-provisionnet revenue (\u201cPPNR\u201d)* was down   \nonly negligibly year-over-year despite the    \nsizeable divestiture, with improvements in    \nPPNR from Wholesale Banking and Consumer and  \nSmall Business Banking. Our capital position  \nwas enhanced relative to peers, while the     \ninterest-rate-risk position of the firm was   \nmeaningfully improved. The leadership of the  \nfirm was enhanced by adding highly talented   \nexecutives from competitors and appropriately \nincentivizing select officers already in      \nplace.

As      \nhighlighted in the \u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d senior\nmanagement and the Board entered 2024         \nevaluating the potential for a transformative \nstrategic move through the sale of our        \nremaining interest in TIH and a balance sheet \nrepositioning to replace TIH\u2019s earnings after \nclosing. With an implied enterprise valuation \nof $15.5 billion, this divestiture            \nstrengthened the balance sheet and created    \nfinancial flexibility for Truist to decisively\npivot to offense in its core wholesale- and   \nconsumer-banking businesses. Due to the       \nsignificance of the TIH sale and balance sheet\nrepositioning for Truist and in alignment with\npeer practices, the Committee adopted a       \nstructured scorecard for the AIP award program\nthat emphasizes a comprehensive evaluation of \nperformance across multiple categories. The   \nstructured scorecard is designed to align with\nthe interests of shareholders, drive long-term\nvalue creation for the franchise, and account \nfor the safety and soundness of Truist        \ncommensurate with its structure, risk profile,\ncomplexity, activities, and size. This        \nscorecard provides the Committee with a       \nframework to comprehensively evaluate         \nperformance relative to Truist\u2019s strategic    \ninitiatives and support strategic and risk-   \nmanagement decisions that are in the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders within the      \ncontext of the current economic and           \ncompetitive environment.

After this is completed, the Committee\nassesses relevant business or function        \nresults, individual performance, and risk-    \nmanagement execution to determine each Covered\nExecutive\u2019s contribution to Truist\u2019s success  \nand AIP award. The corporate payouts for the  \nAIP award program for 2024 range from 0% to   \n200%. * Metrics other than CET1 Capital Ratio,\nOne-and Three-Year TSR, and Revenue may be    \nadjusted to account for unusual or significant\nitems.                                        \n                                \n  46    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Compensation Discussion and Analysis2024    \n  KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES AND STRATEGIC        \n  PRIORITIESThe Committee reviewed the        \n  strategic initiatives for 2024 and          \n  selected from the structured scorecard      \n  those key financial measures and strategic  \n  priorities that were the focus of AIP       \n  corporate performance. While the Committee  \n  selects specific measures for emphasis,     \n  all scorecard components are ultimately     \n  taken into account when determining         \n  corporate performance.The strategic         \n  initiatives for 2024 and the resulting key  \n  financial measures and strategic            \n  priorities selected by the Committee for    \n  2024 were:* Represents anon-GAAPfinancial   \n  measure. Please see Annex A for a           \n  reconciliation from the GAAP amount to the  \n  adjusted amount.The Committee focused on    \n  these financial metrics for their strong    \n  correlation with shareholder returns in     \n  the context of Truist\u2019s strategic,          \n  business, and operational priorities for    \n  2024. EPS and PPNR directly reflect         \n  profitability and the generation of         \n  earnings, which enable us to grow the       \n  franchise. TBVPS plus dividend growth       \n  aligns with the creation of long-term       \n  value for shareholders. Adjusted            \n  noninterest expense (\u201cNIE\u201d)* reflects our   \n  2024 priority to limit expense growth to    \n  0\u20131%. The CET1 Capital Ratio reflects our   \n  2024 priority to create a relative capital  \n  advantage that enhances our ability to      \n  compete. TheOne-YearTSR metric directly     \n  captures the short-term return to           \n  shareholders, which maintains a focus on    \n  our incremental progress in long-term       \n  value creation.The Committee approves       \n  adjustments to GAAP results so that         \n  participants are compensated for core       \n  financial, business, and operational        \n  performance relative to planned levels and  \n  are not artificially penalized or rewarded  \n  fornon-coreevents and other factors         \n  that2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|47                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis do not   \nreflect the ongoing management of the         \nfranchise, such as the gain on the sale of TIH\nand the losses incurred in connection with the\nsubsequent balance-sheet restructuring. The   \nCommittee also believes that these adjustments\nenhance the comparability of the Company\u2019s    \nresults with prior periods. In addition, to   \nfacilitate assessments of performance relative\nto peers, the Committee considers comparable  \nadjustments to their results. The 2024        \nstrategic priorities selected by the Committee\nreflect our strategic transition with the sale\nof TIH, our commitment to business growth and \nexpense discipline, the focus on risk         \nmanagement required of a Category III firm    \nunder federal banking laws, and the cultural  \nand other foundations on which financial,     \nbusiness, and operational results are built.  \nCORPORATE PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED Against 2024   \nKey Financial Measures The table below        \npresents the Company\u2019s achievement with       \nrespect to the financial performance factors  \nselected to be the focus for 2024. The        \nCommittee assessed overall financial          \nperformance as exceeding expectations. The    \nCommittee noted in particular that EPS        \nsignificantly exceeded both the higher        \nexpectations in the Original Plan at the      \nbeginning of 2024 and the revised expectations\nfollowing the TIH transaction in the Final    \nPlan, reflecting both the overall benefit of  \nthe TIH transaction and management\u2019s          \noutperformance in effecting it and the balance\nsheet repositioning. The exceptional EPS      \nperformance was driven by NIE decreasing by   \n0.4% versus 2023, investment banking and      \ntrading income increasing by 46% versus 2023, \nand lower net charge-offs than expected. NIE  \nexceeded our commitment to limit expense      \ngrowth to 0-1%through the successful          \ncompletion of the cost-savings program        \nannounced in September 2023 and disciplined   \nexpense management throughout 2024. Capital   \nsignificantly improved in 2024 primarily due  \nto the sale of TIH, as evidenced by the 47.0% \nTBVPS plus dividend growth and the            \n140-basispoint improvement in the CET1 capital\nratio. Truist maintained the CET1 capital     \nratio at 11.5% while also returning $3.8      \nbillion of capital to shareholders through    \n$2.8 billion in common stock dividends and    \n$1.0 billion in share repurchases. The        \nOriginal Plan and the Final Plan did not      \ninclude the share repurchase program that     \ncommenced in the second half of 2025. In      \naddition, Truist placed in the top half of the\npeer group on all financial measures, except  \nfor One-YearTSR.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents Truist\u2019s ranking out of 11  \n       banks (Truist and its peer group       \n       members) based on percentage growth    \n       in the applicable financial measure    \n       relative to 2023, except that the      \n       ranking for the CET1 capital ratio is  \n       based on the CET1 capital ratios of    \n       Truist and its peer group members      \n  (1)  calculated as of December\u00a031, 2024.    \n       The Committee assessment also          \n       considers the number of positions the  \n       Company improved over the year         \n       relative to January 2024 consensus     \n       estimates for the Company and its      \n       peer group members with respect to     \n       the applicable financial measure for   \n       2024.

The Board approved the     \n       Original Plan prior to the Company     \n       entering into this sale agreement      \n       and, as a result, the Original Plan    \n       does not present PPNR and NIE under    \n       the discontinued operations basis of   \n       presentation.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       TBVPS + Dividend Growth is a growth    \n  (3)  rate. Accordingly, the 2024 Results    \n       vs. 2023 Results value is the 2024     \n       growth rate.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Lower NIE indicates that resources     \n       are being used more effectively.       \n  (4)  Therefore, we have presented           \n       decreases in NIE as a positive change  \n       when compared to the Original Plan,    \n       the Final Plan, and the 2023 results.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the Company\u2019s ranking       \n       relative to its peer group members     \n  (5)  based on actual One-Year TSR results   \n       for 2024.

\nCommittee determined that Truist exceeded its \nfinancial performance goals through the sale  \nof TIH, the securities portfolio              \nrepositioning, as well as growth in its core  \nbusinesses. The Committee also recognized that\nthe Company made tangible progress on its     \nstrategic priorities. These factors supported \nthe Committee\u2019s conclusion that, in the       \naggregate, Truist achieved towards the high   \nend of \u201cAt Expectations\u201d for 2024, and,       \naccordingly, the Committee funded the AIP     \nawards at 107.5% of target. INDIVIDUAL        \nPERFORMANCE The Committee analyzed individual \nNEO performance against their goals for 2024  \nand against risk management execution and     \nestablished final individual AIP awards. In   \neach case, the Committee considered its       \nassessment of risk management under the 2024  \nstrategic priorities and concluded that Truist\ncontinues to mature and enhance its risk      \nmanagement program and processes. The         \nCommittee determined to decrease the overall  \nfunding of the AIP award for Mr. Rogers to 95%\nof target in recognition of his ultimate      \noversight of these processes and limited      \nindividual awards for Messrs. Cummins and     \nMaguire to emphasize their shared oversight of\nthese processes. The Committee adjusted       \npositively the funding of the AIP awards for  \nMs. Lesher and Mr. Wilson, who drove strong   \nperformance for their respective lines of     \nbusiness. FINAL 2024 AIP AWARDS Based on its  \nassessment of corporate and individual        \nresults, the Committee approved the following \nAIP payouts to the named executives:          \n                                              \n                 T\u2026        A\u2026                 \n       B\u2026        A\u2026        A\u2026        AIP      \n  \u2026    S\u2026        (%        (%        Aw\u2026      \n       (\u2026        of        of        ($)      \n                 B\u2026        T\u2026                 \n                 S\u2026                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        1\u2026        3\u2026        9\u2026         3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        7\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026         1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        8\u2026        2\u2026        1\u2026         2\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        7\u2026        2\u2026        1\u2026         1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        7\u2026        2\u2026        1\u2026         1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                \n  50    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis 2025     \nPROGRAM For 2025, the Committee reviewed our  \n2025 strategic objectives and identified the  \nfollowing key financial measures and strategic\npriorities for the year. * Metrics may be     \nadjusted to account for unusual or significant\nitems for Truist and peers. Long-Term         \nIncentive Awards The long-term incentive      \nprogram is intended to provide a significant  \nportion of executive pay opportunity based on \nour future performance and value creation for \nour shareholders. Under this program, 65% of  \nan executive\u2019s long-term incentive opportunity\nis at risk based purely on our performance    \nover a three-year performance period: 40% as  \nPSU awards, which settle in stock; and 25% as \nLTIP awards, which typically settle in cash.  \nThe PSU and LTIP awards use the same          \nperformance measures and weightings. The      \nremaining 35% of the long-term incentive      \nopportunity is granted as time-based RSU      \nawards that do not start vesting until the end\nof the second year and then vest ratably over \nthe next three years. Our 2024\u20132026 long-term \nincentive awards are subject to the general   \nterms set forth in the below chart.

The Committee also\nprovided that the ultimate payout for the PSU \nand LTIP awards is subject to a relative TSR  \nmodifier and the achievement of minimum       \ncapital requirements, each measured over the  \n2024\u20132026 performance period. Together, these \nmetrics are designed to align management      \npriorities with shareholder values\u2014supporting \nprofitability and earnings growth, generating \ncapital, operating within sound risk controls,\nand preserving strong asset quality metrics.  \nFor 2022 and 2023, we granted PSU and LTIP    \nawards that vest based on the achievement of  \nROACE and Return on Average Tangible Common   \nEquity (\u201cROATCE\u201d) goals relative to Truist\u2019s  \npeer group (for awards granted in 2022) and   \nROACE goals relative to Truist\u2019s peer group   \n(for awards granted in 2023). In considering  \nperformance metrics for awards granted in     \n2024, the Committee determined to emphasize   \nprofitability and growth through the use of   \nabsolute and relative EPS metrics and also    \nconsidered that the TIH transaction would     \nimpact our capital structure during the       \nperformance period, making it difficult to    \nevaluate ROACE. 2024\u20132026 PSU and LTIP Award  \nPerformance Measures EPS The absolute EPS and \nrelative EPS growth applicable to the         \n2024\u20132026 PSU and LTIP awards will be         \ncalculated each year based on GAAP EPS, as    \nadjusted for the impact of significant unusual\nitems and, in the case of the absolute EPS    \nmetric, substituting net charge-offs for any  \nprovision benefit or expense. Absolute EPS is \nevaluated against performance levels on a     \n3-yearcumulative basis. Relative EPS is       \nevaluated compared to peer performance on an  \nannual basis with the payout determined each  \nyear, and the final payout is the average of  \nthe payout earned over the three-year period. \nThe payout will be 0% for performance results \nbelow the threshold level.

EPS and      \nROATCE will be calculated based on GAAP net   \nincome available to common shareholders,      \nadjusted for the impact of significant unusual\nitems and substituting net charge-offs for any\nprovision benefit or expense. The Committee   \nselected these performance measures due to    \ntheir alignment with shareholder return. EPS  \nis correlated with TSR and is used as a       \nprimary financial income statement metric for \nbanks and public companies. ROATCE is also    \ncorrelated with TSR and aligns with Truist\u2019s  \npublicly stated medium-term goal to improve   \nROATCE to the mid-teens.The Committee changed \nTSR from a modifier to a metric to directly   \nmeasure shareholder value in determining the  \npayout. In addition, consistent with previous \nPSU and LTIP awards, Truist must maintain a   \nCET1 capital ratio above the minimum capital  \nrequirement, including the stress capital     \nbuffer, as of the last day of the performance \nperiod in order for the awards to pay out.    \nOne-TimePerformance-Based Leadership Awards On\nAugust 26, 2024, the Committee approved the   \ngrant of one-time leadership awards           \n(\u201cLeadership Awards\u201d) with a grant date of    \nSeptember 3, 2024 to support the retention of \nkey leaders who are critical to taking full   \nadvantage of the business opportunities       \ncreated by the TIH sale. With respect to      \nperformance, the Leadership Awards are        \ndesigned to drive the strategic plan and      \nshareholder value creation while incentivizing\nmaintenance of appropriate capital levels and \nappropriate risk management. The Committee    \nchose to make the awards in the form of PSUs  \nrather than RSUs to reflect that recipients   \nmust play a key role in Truist\u2019s long-term    \nsuccess and to reinforce our commitment to a  \npay-for-performancephilosophy. The Committee\u2019s\nrationale for granting the one-timeawards, as \ndescribed more below, was based on Truist\u2019s   \nunique circumstances as it transforms its     \nbusiness. The Committee grants one-timeawards \ninfrequently and believes that the limited and\nstrategic use of targeted one-timeawards may  \nbe an effective tool in times of critical     \ntransformation. The Leadership Awards are     \nsubject to the general terms set forth in the \nbelow chart. Note that dividends are not paid \non any unvested awards.                       \n                                              \n          Perfo\u2026                              \n          Period                              \n          Three     Vest\u2026    Poten\u2026           \n          years     Thre\u2026    Reduc\u2026           \n          (Sept\u2026    cliff    or        Payo\u2026  \n          1,\u00a0       vest\u2026    Forfe\u2026    75%    \n  Awa\u2026    2024 \u2013    on       on        to     \n  Type    August    Augu\u2026    Certa\u2026    125%   \n  Lea\u2026    31,       31,      Event\u2026    of     \n  Awa\u2026    2027)     2027     Yes       targ\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Awards are subject to reduction or     \n       forfeiture if there is an aggregate    \n       operating loss for the performance     \n  (1)  period or the Committee determines     \n       that there has been a significant      \n       negative risk outcome as a result of   \n       a corporate or individual action.      \n                                              \nPERFORMANCE METRICS FOR ONE-TIMELEADERSHIP    \nAWARDS Relative TSR Performance Payouts are   \nbased on our TSR relative to the performance  \nof the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (BKX) over the   \nperformance period.

INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATIONS The     \nCommittee determined to grant Leadership      \nAwards to two named executives, Messrs.       \nMaguire and Wilson, as a retention incentive  \nto mitigate potential flight risk, as both are\nat mid-careerstages with significant tenure   \nand expertise that are critical to Truist\u2019s   \nongoing success. 2024 was an instrumental year\nfor Truist\u2019s Finance team under Mr. Maguire\u2019s \nleadership. The Finance team successfully led \nmany large-scale strategic initiatives that   \nhelped drive the new strategic direction of   \nTruist and position the Company for long-term \nsuccess, including the TIH sale, repositioning\nthe balance sheet, significant work from the  \nInvestor Relations team to manage Truist\u2019s    \nengagement with the investor community, the   \nestablishment of a new Capital Adequacy and   \nResolution Planning team, and significant     \nprogress to strengthen financial risk         \nmanagement. Under Mr. Wilson\u2019s leadership, the\nConsumer and Small Business Banking team      \nexceeded 2024 expectations in several         \ncategories including deposits, loans, non-    \ninterestincome, PPNR, and client engagement   \nand satisfaction scores. In particular, the   \nteam grew net new checking accounts by        \n103,700, and the number of digital banking    \ntransactions surpassed 323 million in 2024.   \nGiven the career progression and marketability\nof Messrs. Maguire and Wilson, the Leadership \nAwards are intended to reinforce their        \ncommitment to our organization. Messrs. Rogers\nand Cummins did not receive the Leadership    \nAwards because they are at later stages in    \ntheir careers, with Mr. Rogers bringing long- \nstanding stability to Truist and Mr. Cummins  \nsubsequently resigning as a result of material\nchanges to his responsibilities, effective    \nJanuary 13, 2025. Meanwhile, Ms. Lesher was   \nrecently hired, and her negotiated            \ncompensation package already includes tailored\nincentives appropriate for her role. In       \ndetermining the size of the Leadership Award  \nfor each of Messrs. Maguire and Wilson, the   \nCommittee took into account the executive\u2019s   \nexpected contribution to the success of the   \nCompany, the holding power of the executive\u2019s \noutstanding equity awards in an increasingly  \ncompetitive environment, the executive\u2019s total\ntarget direct compensation, and the           \nexecutive\u2019s skill set and attractiveness in   \nthe market for talent.                        \n                                              \n                             Grant            \n           Perfo\u2026            Date             \n  Name     Share             Fair             \n           Units             Value            \n                             ($)(1)           \n  Mich\u2026                                       \n  B.               101,7\u2026             4,500\u2026  \n  Magu\u2026                                       \n  Dont\u00e1                                       \n  L.               101,7\u2026             4,500\u2026  \n  Wils\u2026                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       The grant date fair values listed      \n  (1)  above are calculated in accordance     \n       with FASB ASC Topic 718.               \n                                              \nOther Compensation Benefits and Elements      \nLIMITED PERQUISITES Our named executives      \nreceive limited perquisites and other personal\nbenefits that the Committee believes are      \nreasonable and consistent with our overall    \nexecutive-compensation program. Such          \nperquisites may include residential security  \nservices, executive physical wellness         \nexaminations, occasional use of sports        \ntickets, spousal participation in certain     \ncorporate events, and limited personal use of \nthe company aircraft and driver.

These plans consist of the following: \n                                              \n     the Truist Financial Corporation 401(k)  \n     Savings Plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d), which  \n     in 2024 permitted teammates to           \n     contribute up to 50% of their cash       \n     compensation on a tax-deferred or        \n     after-tax basis, within certain          \n  \u2022  Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d)         \n     limits, with Truist providing (a)\u00a0       \n     matching contributions of up to 4% of a  \n     participant\u2019s cash compensation and (b)  \n     discretionary contributions based on     \n     Truist\u2019s achievement of certain          \n     financial goals, which in each case are  \n     100% vested when made                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     the Truist Financial Corporation         \n     Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan  \n     (the \u201cNon-Qualified Defined              \n     Contribution Plan\u201d), which is designed   \n     to augment the benefits under the        \n     401(k) Plan to the extent such benefits  \n     are curtailed by IRS limits (during      \n     2024, eligible participants in the       \n     Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan  \n     were permitted to defer up to 50% of     \n     their cash compensation, with certain    \n     participants eligible to receive a       \n     matching contribution of up to 6% of     \n     their cash compensation (matching        \n     contributions were reduced to 4% of      \n     eligible participants\u2019 cash              \n     compensation beginning January\u00a01,        \n  \u2022  2025))                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  a medical plan that provides coverage    \n     for all eligible teammates               \n                                              \n                                              \n     disability insurance which pays a        \n     teammate 50% of their monthly            \n  \u2022  compensation in the event of             \n     disability, subject to a cap of $35,000  \n     per month (excluding executive           \n     officers)                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     certain other teammate benefits (such    \n  \u2022  as sick leave, vacation, dental and      \n     vision coverage, etc.)                   \n                                              \nThese teammate benefits are determined by the \nsame criteria applicable to all of our        \nteammates, unless otherwise noted. In general,\nbenefits are designed to provide a safety net \nof protection against the financial           \ncatastrophes that can result from illness,    \ndisability, or death, and to provide a        \nreasonable level of retirement income based on\nyears of service with Truist. These benefits  \nare part of the strong value proposition we   \noffer our teammates and help keep us          \ncompetitive in attracting and retaining       \nteammates. We believe that our teammate       \nbenefits are generally on par with benefits   \nprovided by our peer group and consistent with\nindustry standards. PENSION PLANS In addition \nto the benefit plans described above, we      \nmaintain two pension plans:                   \n                                              \n     the Truist Financial Corporation         \n  \u2022  Pension Plan (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d), a     \n     tax-qualified defined benefit            \n     retirement plan for eligible teammates   \n                                              \n                                              \n     the Truist Financial Corporation         \n     Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan (the  \n     \u201cNon-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan\u201d),   \n  \u2022  which is designed to augment the         \n     benefits payable under the Pension Plan  \n     to the extent such benefits are          \n     curtailed by IRS limits                  \n                                              \nThe Pension Plan and the Non-QualifiedDefined \nBenefit Plan are broad-based benefits, and the\nnamed executives participate in both plans on \nthe same basis as other similarly situated    \nteammates. The plans provide retirement       \nbenefits based on length of service and cash  \ncompensation level prior to retirement, with  \nbenefits generally increasing substantially as\na participant approaches retirement. As we are\namong the few remaining companies that offer a\ntraditional pension plan for our teammates, we\nbelieve this benefit provides a competitive   \nadvantage for attracting and retaining talent.\nWe believe the retirement benefits provided by\nthe Pension Plan are meaningful to all        \nteammates, but especially to those who have   \ndevoted substantial service to Truist. For    \nadditional information regarding the benefits \nprovided to our named executives under the    \nPension Plan and the Non-QualifiedDefined     \nBenefit Plan, see the 2024 Pension Benefits   \nTable and the accompanying narrative.         \nSEVERANCE The Company maintains the Amended   \nand Restated Management Change of Control,    \nSeverance and Noncompetition Plan (the        \n\u201cSeverance Plan\u201d), which covers executive     \nofficers, including each of the named         \nexecutives.

The Committee engaged Meridian    \nCompensation Partners, LLC as the Committee\u2019s \nindependent compensation advisor through      \nOctober 31, 2024, and engaged and appointed   \nFarient Advisors LLC as the Committee\u2019s       \nindependent compensation advisor beginning on \nNovember 1, 2024 (each, for the relevant      \nperiods, the \u201ccompensation consultant\u201d). The  \nCommittee also considers summary analyses of  \ntotal compensation delineating each           \ncompensation element (sometimes referred to as\n\u201ctally sheets\u201d), an assessment of executive   \nrisk outcomes (which is reviewed and approved \nby the Risk Committee), competitive           \nbenchmarking, and a review of the Company\u2019s   \ninternal control effectiveness. Performance   \nAdjustments The Committee retains discretion  \nto make adjustments to our performance, as    \nwell as the reported results from members of  \nour peer group, for purposes of performance-  \nbased compensation awards.                    \n                                              \n     Throughout the year, the Committee       \n     reviews projected results and items for  \n     possible adjustment. At the beginning    \n     of each year, the Committee receives     \n     final performance information for the    \n  \u2022  prior year, and historically has made    \n     adjustments to our reported results      \n     (e.g., net income) so that the           \n     applicable compensatory plans fairly     \n     compensate participants for core Truist  \n     performance                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Committee may also make adjustments  \n     to the reported performance of peer      \n  \u2022  group members for awards that measure    \n     our performance relative to the peer     \n     group                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     A reconciliation of adjustments that     \n  \u2022  the Committee made for the purposes of   \n     evaluating 2024 performance is included  \n     in Annex A to this proxy statement       \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated, discussions of    \n2024 performance for compensation purposes in \nthis proxy statement include these adjustments\nmade by the Committee. ROLE OF MANAGEMENT The \nCommittee periodically receives reports from  \nour Chief Audit Officer, the head of our      \ninternal audit function, regarding our        \ninternal controls. After review and approval  \nby the Risk Committee of the executive risk   \noutcomes assessment, the Committee also       \nreceives reports from our Chief Risk Officer  \non our executive risk outcomes assessment for \nthe Company and individual executives. The    \npurpose of these reports is to allow the      \nCommittee to evaluate our current risk        \nenvironment and internal control positions    \nrelevant to incentive compensation, and to    \ntake these issues into consideration when     \ndetermining short-term incentive compensation.\nThe CEO is also involved in compensation      \ndeterminations for executive officers, other  \nthan himself, including for each of the other \nnamed executives, and makes recommendations to\nthe Committee. The CEO is in the best position\nto assess the performance of the other        \nexecutive officers, and he plays an important \nrole in the compensation setting process for  \nexecutive officers. Ultimately, however,      \ndecisions about individual compensation       \nelements and total compensation of all        \nexecutive officers are made by the Committee, \nbased primarily on the executive officer\u2019s    \nperformance and our overall performance, with \nconsideration of the business environment in  \nwhich the results were achieved. In addition, \nthe Risk Committee provides input with respect\nto, and approves the compensation of, the     \nChief Risk Officer, and the Audit Committee   \nprovides input with respect to, and approves  \nthe compensation of, the Chief Audit Officer. \nROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANT The Committee \nengaged each of the compensation consultants  \nto provide market reference perspective and   \nserve as an advisor during their respective   \nterms. The compensation consultant serves at  \nthe request of, and reports directly to, the  \nCommittee. The Committee has the sole         \nauthority to approve the compensation         \nconsultant\u2019s fees and other retention terms,  \nincluding the authority to limit the amount of\nfees the compensation consultant may earn from\nother services provided to Truist. The        \ncompensation consultant performs a review of  \nour executive compensation programs, provides \npeer group analyses, and advises on regulatory\ndevelopments, corporate governance, and best  \npractice trends.                              \n                                \n  58    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The      \nCommittee reviewed whether each of the        \ncompensation consultants is independent and   \nwhether the engagements presented any         \nconflicts of interest. In conducting this     \nreview, the Committee noted that each of the  \ncompensation consultants (i) provides or      \nprovided no services to Truist other than     \ncompensation consulting, (ii) has or had no   \npersonal or business relationships with       \nmembers of our Board or executive officers,   \n(iii) does or did not directly own any shares \nof Truist stock, and (iv) retains or retained \na written policy designed to avoid conflicts  \nof interest that may arise. Each of the       \ncompensation consultants determined that they \nwere independent from our management and      \nconfirmed this in a written statement provided\nto the Chair of the Committee. During 2024,   \nthe compensation consultant provided the      \nfollowing services to the Committee:          \n                                              \n     reviewed Truist\u2019s total compensation     \n  \u2022  philosophy for reasonableness and        \n     appropriateness                          \n                                              \n                                           \n  \u2022  reviewed overall compensation levels  \n                                           \n                                              \n     reviewed our total                       \n     executive-compensation program relative  \n  \u2022  to peers and advised the Committee of    \n     plans or practices that may be changed   \n     to improve effectiveness                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     provided market and peer data and        \n  \u2022  recommendations on executive officer     \n     and senior management compensation       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  reviewed and advised the Committee on    \n     the composition of our peer group        \n                                              \n                                              \n     reviewed public disclosure on            \n  \u2022  compensation, including compensation     \n     disclosures in this proxy statement      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  advised the Committee regarding the      \n     compensation of outside directors        \n                                              \nIn order for the compensation consultant to   \nprovide effective advice, the Committee       \nexpects it to interact with our management    \nfrom time to time.

The Committee      \napproves a group of publicly-traded banks or  \nfinancial services holding companies each year\nto serve as the peer group. The Committee     \nevaluates its peer group on an annual basis.  \nIn evaluating the peer group, the Committee   \nconsiders a number of factors, including      \nindustry and business mix, regulatory         \noversight, assets, revenues, and market       \ncapitalization. The Committee believes it is  \nimportant for the peer group to focus on other\nbanks for performance comparisons and as our  \nprimary market for executive talent. However, \nthe Committee recognizes that there are       \ncurrently only two regional banks similar to  \nour size (i.e., within one-halfto two times   \nour assets and revenues) and business mix. To \ncreate a reasonable sample size for pay and   \nperformance comparisons, the Committee        \ndetermined it appropriate to include          \nadditional companies that provide a balance of\nlarger and smaller banks. Based on its        \ncomprehensive review, the Committee approved  \nmaintaining the peer group consisting of the  \nfollowing 10 companies. Given the wide range  \nin sizes among the peer banks, the Committee  \nuses its judgment in evaluating pay levels    \nrelative to the market data and does not      \ntarget pay at a specific percentile of peers. \n                                              \n        TRUI\u2026                                 \n        2024                                  \n        PEER                                  \n        GROUP                                 \n                 Asse\u2026           Mark\u2026        \n  Com\u2026           ($\u00a0in           Capi\u2026        \n  Name           bill\u2026           ($\u00a0in        \n                                 bill\u2026        \n  JPM\u2026                                        \n  Cha\u2026                  $4,0\u2026           $675  \n  (NY\u2026                                        \n  JPM)                                        \n  Bank                                        \n  of                                          \n  Ame\u2026                  $3,2\u2026           $337  \n  (NY\u2026                                        \n  BAC)                                        \n  Wel\u2026                                        \n  Far\u2026                  $1,9\u2026           $234  \n  (NY\u2026                                        \n  WFC)                                        \n  U.S.                                        \n  Ban\u2026                      $           $\u200775  \n  (NY\u2026                    678                 \n  USB)                                        \n  PNC                                         \n  Fin\u2026                      $           $\u200777  \n  (NY\u2026                    560                 \n  PNC)                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                      $                 \n  Cor\u2026                    531           $\u200758  \n  (NY\u2026                                        \n  TFC)                                        \n  Cit\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                      $           $\u200719  \n  (NY\u2026                    218                 \n  CFG)                                        \n  Fif\u2026                                        \n  Thi\u2026                      $           $\u200728  \n  (NA\u2026                    213                 \n  FIT\u2026                                        \n  M&T                       $                 \n  (NY\u2026                    208           $\u200731  \n  MTB)                                        \n  Key                                         \n  Corp                      $           $\u200719  \n  (NY\u2026                    187                 \n  KEY)                                        \n  Reg\u2026                      $                 \n  (NY\u2026                    157           $\u200721  \n  RF)                                         \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                    50%            50%  \n  per\u2026                                        \n  ran\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  (1)  Data sourced from S&P Global Market    \n       Intelligence as of December\u00a031, 2024.  \n                                              \nIn establishing target pay opportunities, the \nCommittee generally compares each element of  \ncompensation as well as total compensation    \nrelative to the peer group. The Committee also\nreviews market data from other financial      \nservices firms. The Committee establishes pay \nlevels for each executive that are appropriate\nbased on market data as well as other critical\nfactors, including each executive\u2019s specific  \nrole, performance, experience, expertise,     \ninternal pay comparisons, and relative        \nresponsibilities of the named executives.     \nSHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK The Committee considers  \nfeedback from shareholders received during    \nTruist\u2019s annual shareholder engagement        \noutreach and the results of the shareholder   \nadvisory \u201csay-on-pay\u201dvote in its oversight of \nTruist\u2019s executive-compensation program. In   \n2024, the executive compensation for our named\nexecutives received support from approximately\n89% of the votes cast at the annual           \nshareholders meeting. In addition, we         \nproactively discussed the changes made to our \nexecutive-compensation program and the one-   \ntime performance-based Leadership Awards      \ngranted in 2024 during our fall 2024          \nshareholder engagement outreach. For more     \ninformation regarding our Shareholder         \nEngagement program, see \u201cShareholder          \nEngagement Program\u201d beginning on page 28. RISK\nCONSIDERATIONS IN SETTING COMPENSATION We     \nexpect all executive officers to exhibit the  \nhighest levels of ethics and demonstrate best \npractices to discourage unnecessary or        \nexcessive risk taking when conducting         \nactivities on behalf of Truist. The Committee \nroutinely considers whether our executive-    \ncompensation program encourages unnecessary or\nexcessive risk taking, with the goal of       \ndesigning an executive-compensation program to\nencourage prudent risk management and         \ndiscourage inappropriate risk-taking by       \noffering a balanced portfolio of compensation \nopportunities to our named executives that is \nexpected to reward the creation of shareholder\nvalue over time. When determining short-term  \nincentive compensation, and consistent with   \nregulatory guidance, the Committee evaluates  \nour current risk environment and internal     \ncontrol structure relevant to incentive       \ncompensation and reviews an executive risk    \noutcomes assessment and other reports. The    \nCommittee also receives reports from our Chief\nAudit Officer regarding the effectiveness of  \nour overall system of internal controls.      \n                                \n  60    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Balanced \nCompensation Elements The Committee believes  \nthat having market-competitive fixed base     \nsalaries discourages inappropriate risk-      \ntaking. In addition, executives have a        \nsignificant proportion of compensation        \nprovided in the form of equity awards, such as\nPSUs and RSUs that have performance and       \nvesting features that extend over several     \nyears. Additionally, LTIP awards are based on \nour performance over a three-year period,     \nencouraging our named executives to focus on  \nlong-term performance, rather than just annual\nresults, and further reducing risk-taking that\nis likely to produce only short-term benefits \nand allowing sufficient time for risk outcomes\nto emerge. Performance Measures that Adjust   \nfor Risk Under our incentive programs, we use \nperformance metrics that closely correlate to \nshareholder return. Similarly, our incentive  \nprograms include measures that adjust for     \nrisk, including the use of the executive risk \noutcomes assessment for short-term incentive  \ncompensation. Responsible Equity Grant        \nPractices Generally, the timing of our regular\nannual equity awards is determined months in  \nadvance of the actual grants in order to      \ncoincide with the regularly scheduled February\nmeetings of the Board and the Committee. The  \ngrant date is established when the grants and \nall key terms are approved by the Board or the\nCommittee, as the case may be. For the 2024   \nPSU and RSU awards, the Committee used the    \nclosing price of our common stock on the grant\ndate to determine the number of PSU and RSU   \nawards that were granted. In addition, the    \n2022 Incentive Plan includes prohibitions on  \nthe repricing of stock options without        \nshareholder approval. We are required to      \nrecognize the expense of all share-based      \nawards (such as PSUs and RSUs) in our income  \nstatement over the award\u2019s minimum required   \nservice period. Executive Risk Outcomes       \nAssessment / Risk Adjustments We utilize an   \nexecutive risk outcomes assessment process,   \nwhich the Committee may use to adjust, if     \nnecessary, the short-term incentive           \ncompensation of each named executive. In March\n2024, the Committee amended the Executive Risk\nOutcomes Assessment Policy to enhance the     \nprocess, focusing on strengthening the linkage\nbetween risk management and effectiveness and \nthe overall performance of executive and      \nsenior leaders. The executive risk outcomes   \nassessment now includes an independent        \nqualitative risk management effectiveness     \nassessment supported by data and conducted by \nthe Chief Risk Officer and Business Unit Chief\nRisk Officers as a key component of the       \nperformance management process. In addition to\nthe CEO, the executive risk outcomes          \nassessment is now applicable to both direct   \nreports to the CEO and their direct reports, a\npopulation that has the most direct impact on \nTruist\u2019s risk and control environment. In     \nconducting the qualitative assessments of risk\nmanagement effectiveness, the Chief Risk      \nOfficer and Business Unit Chief Risk Officers \nevaluate factors based on impact to the risk  \nprofile of the enterprise and relevant areas  \nof management control and influence. The Risk \nCommittee reviews and approves the assessment \nbefore the outcomes are presented to the      \nCommittee. The executive risk outcomes        \nassessment:                                   \n                                              \n     provides for evaluation of both          \n  \u2022  corporate and individual results that    \n     can be compared to stated risk           \n     appetites in all risk categories         \n                                              \n                                              \n     presents the positive and negative risk  \n     outcomes that have influenced each risk  \n  \u2022  category, if necessary, and includes     \n     recommended actions with respect to      \n     significant negative outcomes            \n                                              \n                                             \n  \u2022  reinforces a culture of accountability  \n                                             \n                                              \n     aligns performance and short-term        \n     incentive compensation with the          \n  \u2022  expectations and outcomes for key        \n     elements of risk management              \n     effectiveness                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     informs the recommendations of the       \n  \u2022  Chief Risk Officer, the CEO, and the     \n     Committee\u2019s own insight and evaluation   \n                                              \n                                              \n     informs our risk review process, in      \n     which 100% of each executive officer\u2019s   \n  \u2022  short-term incentive compensation for    \n     2024 was subject to potential            \n     adjustment                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  is reviewed by the compensation          \n     consultant                               \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the executive risk\noutcomes assessment is an important element to\nappropriately balance incentive compensation  \nat the executive officer level based on risk. \nThe use of this executive risk outcomes       \nassessment has been discussed with our        \nregulators as an additional way to conform to \nincentive compensation guidance and best      \npractices. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS IN       \nSETTING COMPENSATION Banking regulators have  \nprovided input on and influenced the          \ncompensation practices and incentive          \ncompensation structures at the largest        \nfinancial institutions in the United States,  \nfocusing on the risks intrinsic to the design \nand implementation of compensation plans as   \nwell as the reasonableness of each element of \ncompensation. Regulatory guidance is          \nconsidered in the design and implementation of\nour executive-compensation programs. The      \nCommittee continues to assess our pay         \npractices to balance risks and meet           \nstakeholder expectations with our commitment  \nto link named executive pay to our performance\nwhile maintaining executive-compensation      \nprograms that are market competitive and      \nshareholder aligned.                          \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    61  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Section  \n7\u2014Related Policies and Practices Clawback     \nPolicies The Committee adopted the Executive  \nCompensation Recoupment Policy (the           \n\u201cRecoupment Policy\u201d) in 2023. If there is a   \nrestatement of Truist\u2019s financial statements, \nTruist is required to recover, unless the     \nCommittee determines that the recovery is     \nimpractical, the excess of any incentive-based\ncompensation received by any (i) current or   \nformer executive officer and (ii) any other   \nteammate of Truist and its subsidiaries       \ndesignated by the Committee as subject to the \nRecoupment Policy (each, a \u201cdesignated        \nexecutive\u201d), over the incentive-based         \ncompensation that should have been received by\nthe designated executive during the recoupment\nperiod. The recoupment period is the three    \nfiscal years completed immediately preceding  \nthe earlier of (i) the date that Truist       \nconcludes, or reasonably should have          \nconcluded, that Truist is required to prepare \na financial restatement, and (ii) the date on \nwhich a legally authorized body causes Truist \nto prepare a financial restatement. Under the \nRecoupment Policy, Truist may not indemnify   \nany designated executive for any losses in    \nconnection with the recovery of erroneously   \nawarded compensation. Truist\u2019s obligation to  \nrecover erroneously awarded compensation is   \nnot dependent on if or when the restated      \nfinancial statements are filed or any fault of\nthe designated executive for the accounting   \nerrors leading to a restatement. In addition, \nour 2022 Incentive Plan, which is the plan    \npursuant to which we grant all of our AIP,    \nPSU, LTIP, and RSU awards, and related award  \nagreements contain broad language regarding   \nclawbacks and make all awards under the 2022  \nIncentive Plan subject to recoupment,         \nforfeiture, or reduction to the extent        \ndetermined by the Committee as necessary to   \ncomply with applicable law or Truist\u2019s        \npolicies. Our award agreements also allow the \nCommittee to adjust the terms and conditions  \nof the awards in recognition of certain       \nevents, including material restatement of our \nfinancial statements, to prevent dilution or  \nenlargement of benefits intended to be made   \nunder the applicable award. In 2024, the      \nCommittee enhanced its Incentive Compensation \nPolicy to provide that the Committee may      \ncancel, adjust, or clawback all or any part of\nany awards under the 2022 Incentive Plan (i)  \nin the event of certain teammate misconduct,  \nsuch as sales practices violations, a material\nmisrepresentation by the teammate, conduct    \nthat causes material financial or reputational\nharm to Truist, or improperly failing to      \nidentify, raise, or assess, in a timely manner\nand as reasonably expected, issues or concerns\nwith respect to risks material to Truist; (ii)\nif the award was based on materially          \ninaccurate performance metrics, and the       \nteammate was responsible for the inaccuracy;  \nor (iii) for any other reason stated in other \napplicable policies, plans, or agreements. Our\nBoard believes that the current structure of  \nTruist\u2019s incentive compensation recoupment    \npractices is appropriate, effective, provides \na balanced approach to risk management and    \nproperly aligns the interests of our executive\nofficers and shareholders. Share Ownership    \nRequirements The Committee believes that      \nexecutive officers, including the named       \nexecutives, should accumulate meaningful      \nequity stakes in Truist over time to further  \nalign their economic interests with the       \ninterests of shareholders, thereby promoting  \nour objective of increasing shareholder value.\nWe have robust stock ownership requirements so\nthat our executives have significant value    \ntied to long-term stock price performance,    \nwhich discourages a focus on short-term       \nresults and imprudent risk-taking. Our        \nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that  \nour CEO is required to own Truist stock having\na value equal to at least 6x his base salary, \nwhile other executive officers are required to\nown Truist stock having a value of at least 3x\ntheir base salary. The Corporate Governance   \nGuidelines require the minimum level of       \nownership to be met by the later of (i) five  \nyears after initially being appointed an      \nexecutive officer, or (ii) such period of time\nas it takes to reach the ownership requirement\nby continuously holding the shares or RSUs    \ngranted by Truist pursuant to its equity      \ncompensation arrangements. As of December 31, \n2024, each executive officer met these        \nrequirements as applicable to him or her      \n(whether by owning the required value of      \nshares or still being within the grace period \nto achieve such ownership level).

The Corporate Insider Trading     \nPolicy also prohibits a teammate, director, or\nother restricted party who, in the course of  \nperforming services for Truist, learns of     \nmaterial, nonpublic information about a       \ncompany or other entity other than Truist or a\nsecurity of a company or other entity other   \nthan Truist\u2014including a client of Truist, a   \nsupplier of Truist, and a company or other    \nentity involved in financial services\u2014from (i)\nengaging in a securities transaction relating \nto the company or other entity, and (ii)      \ndisclosing the information to any person or   \nentity where the restricted party knows or has\nreason to know that the recipient of the      \ninformation will execute a related securities \ntransaction or will disclose the information  \nto another person or entity who will execute a\nrelated securities transaction. In addition,  \nthe Corporate Insider Trading Policy sets     \nforth blackout period limitations, including  \nregular blackout periods for directors,       \nexecutive officers, and other senior Truist   \nparties prohibiting them from trading in      \nTruist securities in the weeks leading up to  \nTruist\u2019s quarterly earnings announcements     \nuntil the trading day after one full trading  \nday has passed since the release of Truist\u2019s  \nquarterly earnings announcements.             \n                               \n  62    |2025 Proxy Statement  \n                               \nTable of Contents\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The      \nCorporate Trading Policy addresses            \ntransactions by Truist Financial Corporation  \nor Truist Bank involving the purchase, sale,  \ngift, transfer, trade, or issuance of any     \nsecurity of Truist Financial Corporation or   \nTruist Bank outside of a Rule 10b5-1plan or   \nentry into, amendment of, or termination of a \nRule 10b5-1plan by Truist Financial           \nCorporation or Truist Bank involving any of   \nthose transactions.

In 2024,      \n       annual PSUs and RSUs were granted to   \n       the NEOs on February\u00a026, 2024. In      \n       addition, a one-time award of RSUs     \n       was granted to Ms.\u00a0Lesher on March 1,  \n       2024 in connection with her            \n       commencement of employment with        \n       Truist, and on September\u00a03, 2024,      \n       one-time Leadership Awards of PSUs     \n       were granted to Messrs.\u00a0Maguire and    \n       Wilson. For 2024, PSUs were valued     \n       using a Monte Carlo simulation         \n       assuming a probable payout as of the   \n       grant date of target performance and   \n       estimating the fair value associated   \n       with a probable payout at target       \n       ($29.72 for February\u00a026, 2024 grants   \n       and $40.28 for September\u00a03, 2024       \n       grants) consistent with the approach   \n       for FASB ASC Topic 718 expensing. The  \n       February\u00a026, 2024 RSUs were valued     \n       using the grant price of $34.53 less   \n  (2)  the present value of future dividends  \n       of $5.79, or $28.74, and the March\u00a01,  \n       2024 RSUs were valued using the grant  \n       price of $35.26 less the present       \n       value of future dividends of $3.94,    \n       or $31.32, consistent with the         \n       approach for FASB ASC Topic 718        \n       expensing.

SEC rules     \nrequire that the number of shares reported in \ncolumn (i) is based on achieving threshold    \nperformance goals, except that if the previous\nfiscal year\u2019s performance has exceeded the    \nthreshold, the number of shares must be based \non the next higher performance measure (target\nor maximum) that exceeds the previous fiscal  \nyear\u2019s performance. The vesting date for all  \nPSU awards is March 15 of the year following  \nthe final year of the performance period. If  \nthe performance criteria are not met, up to   \n100% of the PSUs is subject to forfeiture.    \nOption Exercises and Stock Vested in 2024 (1) \n                                              \n       O\u2026                 S\u2026                  \n       A\u2026                 A\u2026                  \n       N\u2026                 N\u2026                  \n       of       Va\u2026       of         V\u2026       \n       S\u2026       Re\u2026       S\u2026         R\u2026       \n  \u2026    A\u2026       on        A\u2026         on       \n       on       Ex\u2026       on         V\u2026       \n       E\u2026       ($)       V\u2026         (\u2026       \n       (\u2026                 (\u2026                  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        70\u2026        2,\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        12\u2026        44\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014          \u2014          \u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        49\u2026        1,\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014         \u2014        17\u2026        60\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       This table presents gross share        \n  (1)  amounts without accounting for shares  \n       withheld upon vesting for payment of   \n       taxes.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Based on the $34.86 closing price of   \n       Truist\u2019s common stock on March\u00a015,     \n  (2)  2024, $41.84 on September\u00a013, 2024,    \n       and $45.78 on December\u00a013, 2024, the   \n       dates of vesting.                      \n                                              \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    69  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation of Executive Officers 2024       \nPension Benefits (1)                          \n                                              \n               Nu\u2026        Pr\u2026         Pa\u2026     \n               of\u00a0        Va\u2026         Du\u2026     \n  N\u2026    Pl\u2026    Ye\u2026        of          La\u2026     \n        Na\u2026    Cr\u2026        Ac\u2026         Fi\u2026     \n               Se\u2026        Be\u2026         Ye\u2026     \n               (#)        ($)         ($)     \n  W\u2026                                          \n  H.

Those plans have\nprovisions which differ from the Truist plans \ndiscussed below. The Company merged the       \nSunTrust qualified pension plan into the      \nTruist Pension Plan in 2020. Mr. Rogers       \ncontinues to participate in the SunTrust ERISA\nExcess Plan and the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Tier \n2 SERP, although any future benefit accruals  \nwill come only from the Pension Plan and Non- \nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan as benefit      \naccruals under these heritage SunTrust plans  \nwere frozen prior to the merger. Mr. Cummins  \nparticipated in the SunTrust ERISA Excess Plan\nuntil his resignation. Tax-QualifiedDefined   \nBenefit Plan. The Pension Plan is a tax-      \nqualifieddefined benefit pension plan for     \neligible teammates. Most teammates of Truist  \nand its subsidiaries who have attained age 21 \nare eligible to participate in the Pension    \nPlan after completing one year of service. Our\ncontributions to the Pension Plan are computed\non an actuarial basis. No participant         \ncontributions are permitted. Except as        \ndescribed below for teammates hired or rehired\non or after January 1, 2024, a participant\u2019s  \nannual normal retirement benefit under the    \nPension Plan at age 65 is an amount equal to  \n1.0% of the participant\u2019s final average       \ncompensation plus 0.5% of the participant\u2019s   \nfinal average compensation in excess of Social\nSecurity covered compensation, multiplied by  \nthe number of years of creditable service     \ncompleted up to a maximum of 35 years. A      \nparticipant\u2019s final average compensation is   \nhis or her average annual cash compensation,  \nincluding salary, wages, overtime, bonuses,   \nand nonequity incentive compensation, for the \nfive consecutive years in the last ten years  \nin which he or she receives compensation that \nproduces the highest average.                 \n                                \n  70    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation of Executive Officers Effective  \nJanuary 1, 2024, the formula for the pension  \nplan was modified for new hires and rehires.  \nEach of those participant\u2019s annual normal     \nretirement benefit under the Pension Plan is  \nan amount equal to 0.94% of the participant\u2019s \nfinal average compensation plus 0.47% of the  \nparticipant\u2019s final average compensation in   \nexcess of Social Security covered             \ncompensation, multiplied by the number of     \nyears of creditable service completed up to a \nmaximum of 35 years. The new formula requires \nthese participants to work two additional     \nyears in order to receive the same benefit as \nunder the formula for participants already    \nexisting prior to January 1, 2024, in essence,\nmoving full retirement benefits to 67 years of\nage. Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan.The    \nNon-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan is an excess\nbenefit plan designed to provide supplemental \npension benefits for certain highly           \ncompensated teammates, including the NEOs, to \nthe extent that their benefits under the      \nPension Plan are curtailed due to IRS         \ncompensation and benefit limitations. Benefits\nunder the Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan   \nare included in the table above.              \nRetirement.Messrs. Rogers and Cummins have met\nthe requirements for retirement under the     \nPension Plan and the Non-QualifiedDefined     \nBenefit Plan. While the general retirement age\nis 65, teammates with at least 10 years of    \nservice who have attained age 55 are eligible \nto retire and begin receiving a reduced       \npension immediately. If a teammate begins     \npension payments prior to the normal          \nretirement age of 65, the payments are reduced\nbased on a plan-specified reduction schedule  \nranging from receipt of 50% at age 55,        \nincreasing until reaching 98% at age 64, with \nthe increases weighted more heavily toward the\nearlier years. Generally, pension benefits    \nunder each plan are paid to qualifying        \nparticipants in the form of a life annuity for\nnon-marriedparticipants and a joint and 50%   \nsurvivor annuity for married participants.    \n2024 Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation       \n                                              \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       A\u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       W\u2026       B\u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       at     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       (\u2026       1\u2026     \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                (\u2026     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2014        \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014        \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2014        \u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2014        \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         Executive contributions were based   \n         on each NEO\u2019s deferral elections     \n  (1)    and the salaries, AIP awards, and    \n         LTIP payments, if any, received by   \n         each NEO in 2024.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n         This column represents Truist\u2019s      \n         matching contributions credited to   \n         the accounts of the NEOs during      \n  (2)    2024 in respect of the NEO\u2019s         \n         contributions.

Matching         \ncontributions were reduced to 4% of eligible  \nparticipants\u2019 cash compensation beginning     \nJanuary 1, 2025. All cash compensation is     \neligible for deferral unless prohibited under \nInternal Revenue Code Section 409A. Plan      \nparticipants may select deemed investment     \nfunds under the Non-QualifiedDefined          \nContribution Plan that are identical to the   \ninvestment funds offered under the 401(k) Plan\nwith the exception that no deemed investments \nin Truist common stock are permitted.         \nParticipants make an election upon entering   \nthe Non-QualifiedDefined Contribution Plan    \nregarding the timing of plan distributions.   \nThe two allowable distribution elections are  \ndistribution upon termination or distribution \nbased on a selected age following termination \nnot to exceed age 65. The Non-QualifiedDefined\nContribution Plan also allows for an in-      \nservicehardship withdrawal based on facts and \ncircumstances that meet IRS guidelines. The   \nNon-QualifiedDefined Contribution Plan also   \nprovides participants in our incentive        \ncompensation plans with an effective means of \nelecting to defer, on a pre-taxbasis, a       \nportion of the payments that they are entitled\nto receive under such plans.                  \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    71  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation of Executive Officers Potential  \nPayments Upon Termination or Change of Control\nThe potential payments to the NEOs, with the  \nexception of Mr. Cummins, pursuant to existing\nplans and arrangements in the event of their  \ntermination or a change of control at December\n31, 2024 are shown in the table below.

(1)  will receive pro-rated short-term      \n       incentive awards. The amounts for      \n       these NEOs reflect fiscal year 2024    \n       actual AIP award payouts as the table  \n       assumes termination on December\u00a031,    \n       2024.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Following termination due to           \n       retirement, death, disability, or      \n       other than for Cause or for Good       \n       Reason, LTIP and PSU awards remain     \n       subject to the Company\u2019s actual        \n       performance. Therefore, we have        \n       calculated these amounts using actual  \n       performance for the 2022 LTIP and PSU  \n       awards and an assumption of target     \n       performance for both the 2023 and      \n       2024 LTIP and PSU awards. However,     \n       these are forward-looking statements   \n       that may not be representative of      \n       actual performance. For these          \n       scenarios, the amounts include for     \n       the 2023 and 2024 LTIP awards          \n       pro-rated numbers reflecting a         \n       termination date of December\u00a031, 2024  \n       as LTIP awards are calculated as a     \n       percentage of the NEO\u2019s average        \n       salary over the three-year             \n       performance period, and salary for     \n       periods after termination is zero.     \n       Following a change of control, the     \n       NEO is entitled to LTIP payments       \n  (2)  prorated through the date of the       \n       change of control.

The actual amounts to be\npaid can only be determined at the time of a  \nNEO\u2019s termination of employment. The amounts  \nreported above do not include amounts that    \nwould be provided to the NEOs under plans and \narrangements that are generally available to  \nall salaried teammates or amounts reported in \nthe \u201c2024 Pension Benefits\u201d and \u201c2024 Non-    \nQualifiedDeferred Compensation\u201d tables.

Named Executive Officers   \nUnder the Severance Plan, each of the NEOs,   \nwho undergoes a qualifying termination (i)    \nother than for Cause, or (ii) for Good Reason,\nincluding in the case of such a termination of\nemployment that occurs within 24 months after \na Change of Control, will receive, subject to \nthe NEO\u2019s execution of a general release of   \nclaims:                                       \n                                              \n       A lump sum payment equal to two times  \n       the sum of (a)\u00a0the NEO\u2019s annual base   \n       salary (annualized), as most recently  \n       increased, plus (b)\u00a0the annual cash    \n       bonus the NEO would have received for  \n  (i)  the year of termination assuming       \n       target performance, offset by the      \n       extent to which the NEO receives base  \n       salary or annual cash bonus payments   \n       during the garden leave period         \n       described below; and                   \n                                              \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    73  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCompensation of Executive Officers            \n                                              \n        To the extent the NEO has been        \n        participating in the medical,         \n        dental, or vision plans of Truist or  \n        an affiliate as of the date of        \n        termination, Truist will pay to the   \n        NEO a lump sum payment in cash equal  \n        to the product of (a) 24 multiplied   \n        by (b)\u00a0the monthly COBRA premium as   \n  (ii)  of the date of termination for the    \n        medical, dental, and vision coverage  \n        the NEO had immediately prior to the  \n        date of termination minus the         \n        monthly dollar amount the NEO would   \n        have paid to Truist for such          \n        coverage, offset by the extent to     \n        which the NEO participates in such    \n        benefit plans during the garden       \n        leave period described below.         \n                                              \nAll outstanding PSUs, RSUs, and LTIP awards as\nof the termination date will either be        \nforfeited or vest under the terms and         \nconditions of the incentive plans and award   \nagreements under which they were granted      \ndepending on the circumstances of the         \ntermination and the retirement eligibility of \nthe NEO. In the event of the death or         \ndisability of any NEO, the Company and Truist \nBank will use their best efforts to accelerate\nvesting of any unvested benefits to which the \nNEO may be entitled under any stock-based or  \nother benefit plan or arrangement to the      \nextent permitted by the terms of such plans.  \nThe Severance Plan also includes a non-       \ncompetitionobligation applicable to           \nparticipants who have been designated by the  \nBoard as \u201cofficers\u201d within the meaning of Rule\n16a-1(f)promulgated under the Exchange Act    \n(\u201cSection 16 Officers\u201d), and for all          \nparticipants an obligation not to solicit     \nTruist teammates or clients, each obligation  \ncontinuing for 12 consecutive months after the\ndate of termination of employment. These      \nprohibitions generally preclude the Section 16\nOfficers (currently all NEOs participating in \nthe Severance Plan are Section 16 Officers)   \nfrom working for a direct competitor providing\nbanking or financial products or services     \nwithin the continental United States.         \nAdditionally, the non-solicitationcovenants   \nprohibit the participant from soliciting or   \nassisting in the solicitation of any recipient\nof the Company\u2019s banking or financial products\nor services and other Company clients or      \ninducing any of our teammates to terminate    \ntheir employment with the Company or its      \naffiliates. The Severance Plan also provides  \nfor a three month garden leave period for     \nparticipants who resign with or without Good  \nReason. The participant must provide the      \nCompany with three months\u2019 advance written    \nnotice of his or her termination of           \nemployment, and during the three month garden \nleave period, he or she will remain employed  \nby Truist. The Severance Plan provides for    \nreductions in payments to the extent necessary\nto avoid exceeding the limits established by  \nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.    \nPayments in excess of these limits are often  \nreferred to as \u201cexcess parachute payments,\u201d   \nand exceeding the Section 280G limits         \ngenerally triggers an excise tax on the       \npayments. Under the Severance Plan, if        \ntermination payments and benefits to be       \nprovided (along with any other payments and   \nbenefits available to the NEO) will constitute\nan excess parachute payment, then the payments\nwill be reduced to an amount that is $1.00    \nless than the amount that would cause the     \npayments to be an excess parachute payment;   \nprovided, however, that such a reduction will \nonly be imposed if the reduction results in a \ngreater after-taxbenefit to the NEO than if   \nsuch payments had not been reduced. For       \npurposes of the Severance Plan, the 2012      \nIncentive Plan, the 2022 Incentive Plan, and  \naward agreements, \u201cChange of Control\u201d means a \nchange in ownership or effective control of   \nTruist or a change in the ownership of a      \nsubstantial portion of the assets of Truist   \n(as described under Section 409A of the       \nInternal Revenue Code). For purposes of the   \nSeverance Plan, \u201cCause\u201d generally means one or\nmore of the following by the NEO: (i)         \ndishonesty, theft, or embezzlement; (ii)      \nrefusal or failure to perform the NEO\u2019s       \nassigned duties for the Company or any of its \naffiliates in a satisfactory manner; or (iii) \nengaging in any conduct that could be         \nmaterially damaging to the Company or any of  \nits affiliates without a reasonable good faith\nbelief that such conduct was in the best      \ninterest of the Company or any of its         \naffiliates; provided, however, that if capable\nof cure, a termination for Cause under clauses\n(ii) or (iii) will only be effective if the   \nNEO fails to cure the circumstances giving    \nrise to termination for Cause within 30 days  \nfollowing delivery of a notice of termination \nby the Company. The Severance Plan generally  \ndefines \u201cGood Reason\u201d as one or more of the   \nfollowing conditions without the NEO\u2019s express\nwritten consent, in each case, that is not    \ncured by the Company within 30 days following \ndelivery of a notice of termination by the    \nNEO:                                          \n                                              \n       a material diminution in the NEO\u2019s     \n       position, authority, duties, or        \n       responsibilities (including the        \n       assignment to the NEO of any duties    \n       or responsibilities materially and     \n       adversely inconsistent with the NEO\u2019s  \n  (i)  position, authority, duties, or        \n       responsibilities then in effect,       \n       excluding for this purpose an          \n       isolated, insubstantial, and           \n       inadvertent action not taken in bad    \n       faith and which is remedied by the     \n       Company promptly after receipt of      \n       notice thereof given by the NEO);      \n                                              \n                                              \n        a material reduction (other than      \n        pursuant to a uniform reduction       \n  (ii)  applicable to other similarly         \n        situated executives of the Company)   \n        in the base salary or annual target   \n        bonus opportunity of the NEO;         \n                                              \n                                              \n         the Company\u2019s requirement that the   \n         NEO relocate the NEO\u2019s principal     \n  (iii)  business office to any location      \n         more than 35 miles from its          \n         then-current location; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n        the Company\u2019s failure to obtain the   \n        assumption of the Severance Plan by   \n        any successor (whether direct or      \n        indirect, by purchase, merger,        \n  (iv)  consolidation, or otherwise) to all   \n        or substantially all of the business  \n        or assets of the Company, or any      \n        business of the Company for which     \n        the NEO\u2019s services are principally    \n        performed.                            \n                                              \nThe NEO must deliver the notice of termination\nto the Company within 90 days of actual       \nknowledge of the act or omission constituting \nGood Reason.                                  \n                                \n  74    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Compensation of Executive OfficersFor       \n  purposes of the 2012 Incentive Plan, the    \n  2022 Incentive Plan, and related award      \n  agreements, \u201cDisability\u201d means: (i)\u00a0the     \n  NEO incurs a separation from service for    \n  disability under a disability insurance     \n  program of Truist or an affiliate in which  \n  the NEO participates, (ii)\u00a0if the NEO is    \n  not a participant in a disability           \n  insurance program of Truist or an           \n  affiliate, if the NEO suffers from any      \n  medically determinable physical or mental   \n  impairment that can be expected to result   \n  in death or can be expected to last for a   \n  continuous period of not less than six      \n  months, where such impairment causes the    \n  individual to be unable to perform the      \n  duties of employment or any substantially   \n  similar position of employment and the NEO  \n  incurs a \u201cseparation from service,\u201d within  \n  the meaning of Internal Revenue Code        \n  Section\u00a0409A, from Truist and its           \n  affiliates, and (iii)\u00a0with respect to any   \n  incentive option, the \u201cpermanent and total  \n  disability\u201d of the NEO as defined in        \n  Section\u00a022(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue    \n  Code.Hugh S. Cummins IIIMr.\u00a0Cummins\u2019        \n  resignation resulted from material changes  \n  to his responsibilities by Truist           \n  following completion of several strategic   \n  initiatives in which Mr.\u00a0Cummins played a   \n  key role, including the sale of TIH and     \n  the development of Truist\u2019s strategic       \n  direction after that transaction. As a      \n  result, Mr.\u00a0Cummins was entitled to the     \n  benefits of a resignation for Good Reason   \n  under the Severance Plan and received       \n  separation pay in the gross amount of       \n  $6,174,701.92 (including welfare            \n  benefits). Mr.\u00a0Cummins also remained        \n  eligible for his full AIP award for 2024    \n  and is receiving outplacement benefits      \n  from Truist.

As a result of a         \n  resignation for Good Reason, PSU and LTIP   \n  awards continue to vest based on the        \n  Company\u2019s actual performance, and RSU       \n  awards continue to vest on the original     \n  schedule, except that the remaining         \n  outstanding RSU awards granted to Mr.\u00a0      \n  Cummins on September\u00a01, 2021 were           \n  forfeited as they were conditioned on       \n  employment without continued vesting for    \n  retirement or resignation for Good          \n  Reason.2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|75             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nPay Ratio Disclosure SEC rules require us to  \ndisclose the ratio of the annual total        \ncompensation of our CEO to the median         \nemployee\u2019s (teammate\u2019s) annual total          \ncompensation. For 2024, Mr. Roger\u2019s annual    \ntotal compensation was $13,968,666, and the   \nmedian teammate\u2019s annual total compensation   \nwas $93,785. These amounts include the value  \nof certain non-discriminatorybenefits. Based  \nupon this information, the ratio of the annual\ntotal compensation of our CEO to the median   \nteammate was 149 to 1. The CEO pay ratio rules\nallow us to use the same median teammate for  \ncomparison purposes for up to three years.    \nAlthough we identified a median teammate for  \n2023, we have decided to select a new median  \nteammate for 2024 due to changes in our       \nteammate population as a result of the cost   \nsavings program we completed in early 2025 and\nthe sale of TIH. For purposes of identifying  \nour median teammate for 2024, we examined our \nteammate population, excluding our CEO, as of \nDecember 31, 2024.

EPS for   \n      purposes of our incentive compensation  \n      plans is anon-GAAPfinancial measure.    \n      SeeAnnex Afor a reconciliation of GAAP  \n      earnings per share to EPS for purposes  \n      of our incentive compensation plans     \n      for 2024 and 2023.

Analysis of the Information         \nPresented in the Pay Versus Performance Table \nAs described in more detail in the CD&A, the  \nCompany\u2019s executive-compensation program      \nreflects a pay-for-performancephilosophy.     \nWhile the Company utilizes several performance\nmeasures to align executive compensation with \nCompany performance, all of those Company     \nmeasures are not presented in the PvP table   \nset forth above. Moreover, the Company        \ngenerally seeks to incentivize long-term      \nperformance, and therefore does not           \nspecifically align the Company\u2019s performance  \nmeasures with compensation that is actually   \npaid (as computed in accordance with Item     \n402(v) of Regulation S-K)for a particular     \nyear. In accordance with Item 402(v) of       \nRegulation S-K,the Company is providing the   \nfollowing descriptions of the relationships   \nbetween information presented in the PvP      \ntable.                                        \n                                \n  2025 Proxy Statement\u2002|    79  \n                                \nTable of Contents\nPay Versus Performance Compensation Actually  \nPaid and Cumulative TSR The amount of         \ncompensation actually paid to the PEOs,       \nMessrs. King and Rogers (as applicable), and  \nthe average amount of compensation actually   \npaid to the Company\u2019s NEOs as a group         \n(excluding Messrs. King and/or Rogers, as     \napplicable) is generally aligned with the     \nCompany\u2019s cumulative TSR over the five years  \npresented in the table. The alignment of      \ncompensation actually paid with the Company\u2019s \ncumulative TSR over the period presented is   \nprimarily because a significant portion of the\ncompensation actually paid to the NEOs is     \ncomprised of equity awards. As described in   \nmore detail in the CD&A, as of December 31,   \n2024, approximately 51% of the value of total \ntarget compensation awarded to the CEO and 47%\nof the value of total target compensation     \nawarded to the other NEOs consists of equity  \nawards, including RSU and PSU awards.         \nCompensation Actually Paid and GAAP Net Income\nThe amount of compensation actually paid to   \nthe PEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as         \napplicable), and the average amount of        \ncompensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s   \nNEOs as a group (excluding Messrs. King and/or\nRogers, as applicable) is generally           \nalignedwith the Company\u2019s GAAP net income over\nthe five years presented in the PvP table.    \nWhile the Company has not emphasized net      \nincome as a performance measure in the overall\nexecutive-compensation program, the measure of\nnet income is correlated with several of the  \nperformance measures which the Company uses   \nwhen assessing performance or setting goals in\nthe Company\u2019s short-term and long-term        \nincentive compensation plans, such as EPS and \nPPNR. Each of these measures is either        \ncalculated using net income as a component or \nis a significant driver of net income. As     \ndescribed in more detail in the CD&A, as of   \nDecember 31, 2024, approximately 68% of the   \nvalue of total target compensation awarded to \nthe CEO and 66% of the value of total target  \ncompensation                                  \n                               \n  80    |2025 Proxy Statement  \n                               \nTable of Contents\nPay Versus Performance awarded to the other   \nNEOs is performance-based pay largely         \ndependent on financial measures that are      \ncalculated using net income as a key element  \nor that have a significant impact on net      \nincome. Compensation Actually Paid and EPS The\namount of compensation actually paid to the   \nPEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as applicable),\nand the average amount of compensation        \nactually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs as a group\n(excluding Messrs. King and/or Rogers, as     \napplicable) is generally aligned with the     \nCompany\u2019s EPS over the five years presented in\nthe PvP table, although EPS remained flat in  \n2024 while compensation actually paid         \nincreased as discussed below. For purposes of \nour incentive compensation plans, EPS is      \ndefined as the Company\u2019s net income available \nto common shareholders for the applicable     \nyear, adjusted for certain unexpected or non- \ncoreperformance items as determined by the    \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee,     \ndivided by the average number of fully diluted\ncommon shares outstanding during the year.EPS \nfor purposes of our incentive compensation    \nplans is a non-GAAPfinancial measure. See     \nAnnex Afor a reconciliation of GAAP earnings  \nper share to EPS as used in our incentive     \ncompensation plans for 2024 and 2023. While   \nthe Company uses numerous financial and non-  \nfinancialperformance measures for the purpose \nof evaluating performance for the Company\u2019s   \ncompensation programs, the Company has        \ndetermined that EPS is the financial          \nperformance measure that, in the Company\u2019s    \nassessment, represents the most important     \nperformance measure (that is not otherwise    \nrequired to be disclosed in the PvP table)    \nused by the Company to link compensation      \nactually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs, for the  \nmost recently completed fiscal year, to       \nCompany performance. The Compensation and     \nHuman Capital Committee has chosen EPS as a   \nprimary financial measure in the Company\u2019s AIP\naward program. In 2024, the Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee determined to use EPS \n(both absolute EPS and EPS growth relative to \npeers) as the primary performance metrics for \nthe 2024\u20132026 PSU and LTIP awards.

Each share of our common stock\nissued and outstanding on the record date is  \nentitled to one vote on each proposal at the  \nmeeting. Shares held in a fiduciary capacity  \nby Truist Bank and certain other of our       \naffiliates may only be voted in accordance    \nwith the instruments creating the fiduciary   \ncapacity. As of the close of business on      \nFebruary 20, 2025, there were 1,305,390,708   \nshares of our common stock outstanding and    \nentitled to vote. Quorum Requirements In order\nto obtain a quorum to conduct the Annual      \nMeeting, a majority of shares of our common   \nstock outstanding at the record date must be  \npresent (virtually) or by proxy. Shareholders \nwho deliver valid proxies or attend the       \nvirtual meeting will be considered part of the\nquorum. Once a share is represented for any   \npurpose at the meeting, it is deemed present  \nfor quorum purposes for the remainder of the  \nmeeting and for any adjourned meeting, unless \na new record date is or must be set for the   \nadjourned meeting. Abstentions and broker     \n\u201cnon-votes\u201d(explained below) are counted as   \npresent and entitled to vote for purposes of  \ndetermining whether a quorum exists.

We may not\nbe able to address all questions asked during \nthe time allotted for questions during the    \nAnnual Meeting and will focus on those issues \nthat appear to be of the greatest interest to \nshareholders. You may log into and attend the \nvirtual Annual Meeting beginning at 10:45 a.m.\nET on April 29, 2025. The Annual Meeting will \nbegin promptly at 11:00 a.m. ET.

Shareholders who participate in the  \nAnnual Meeting virtually by way of the link   \nprovided above will be deemed to be present in\nperson, including for purposes of determining \na quorum. Please note that participation in   \nthe virtual Annual Meeting is subject to      \ncapacity limits of the virtual meeting        \nplatform provider and access to the meeting   \nwill be granted on a first-come, first-served \nbasis. Additional information regarding the   \nrules and procedures for participating in our \nAnnual Meeting will be provided in our meeting\nrules of conduct, which shareholders can view \nduring the meeting on the meeting website.    \nVotes Required, Non-Votes,Abstentions, and    \nRevocations For the election of directors,    \neach director nominee must receive the        \naffirmative vote of a majority of votes cast  \nin order to be elected. Proposals 2 and 3     \nrequire the affirmative vote of a majority of \nvotes cast on each proposal. An affirmative   \nmajority of the votes cast means the number of\nvotes cast \u201cfor\u201d the applicable director or   \nproposal exceeds the number of votes cast     \n\u201cagainst\u201d the applicable director or proposal.\nA broker or other nominee may generally vote  \nyour shares without instruction on routine    \nmatters but not on non-routinematters. A      \nbroker \u201cnon-vote\u201doccurs when your broker      \nsubmits a proxy for your shares but does not  \nindicate a vote for a particular \u201cnon-        \nroutine\u201dproposal because your broker does not \nhave authority to vote on that proposal and   \nhas not received specific voting instructions \nfrom you. Brokers and other nominees who are  \nNew York Stock Exchange members are expected  \nto have discretionary voting power only for   \nProposal 2, the ratification of               \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent \nauditor, but not for any other proposals. As a\nresult, if you do not provide specific voting \ninstructions to your record holder, New York  \nStock Exchange rules will allow the record    \nholder to vote only on Proposal 2, and not on \nProposals 1 or 3. Broker non-votes,as well as \nabstentions, will be counted in the number of \nshares represented for purposes of determining\nwhether a quorum is present, but they will not\nbe counted as votes cast for or against any of\nthe proposals, and therefore will not affect  \nthe outcome of the vote. Holders of our common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights in \nthe election of directors. A proxy may be     \nrevoked by a shareholder at any time before it\nis exercised by submitting to the Corporate   \nSecretary of Truist an instrument revoking it,\nsubmitting a duly executed proxy bearing a    \nlater date (including a proxy given over the  \ninternet or by telephone), or by attending the\nvirtual Annual Meeting and electing to vote   \nusing the virtual platform. Even if you plan  \nto attend the virtual Annual Meeting, you are \nencouraged to vote your shares in advance by  \nproxy. Delivering Proxy Materials We deliver  \nproxy materials primarily through the internet\nin accordance with SEC rules. In addition to  \nreducing the amount of paper used in producing\nthe materials, this method lowers the costs   \nassociated with mailing the proxy materials to\nshareholders. Shareholders who own Truist     \ncommon shares directly and not through a bank,\nbroker, or nominee (\u201crecord holders\u201d) will    \nhave proxy materials or the Notice of Internet\nAvailability delivered directly to their      \nmailing address or electronically if they have\npreviously consented to delivery by email.    \nShareholders whose shares are held for them by\nbanks, brokers, or other nominees (\u201cbeneficial\nholders\u201d) will have the proxy materials or the\nNotice of Internet Availability forwarded to  \nthem by the intermediary that holds the       \nshares.                                       \n                                \n  86    |\u20022025 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nVoting and Other Information If you received  \nonly a Notice of Internet Availability by     \nmail, you will not receive a printed copy of  \nthe proxy materials unless you request a copy \nby following the instructions on the notice.  \nThe Notice of Internet Availability also      \ncontains instructions for accessing and       \nreviewing the proxy materials over the        \ninternet and provides directions for          \nsubmitting your vote over the internet.

To reduce the expenses of  \ndelivering duplicate proxy materials to       \nshareholders, we rely on SEC rules that permit\nus to deliver only one set of applicable proxy\nmaterials to multiple shareholders who share  \nan address, unless we receive contrary        \ninstructions from any shareholder at that     \naddress. All shareholders sharing an address  \nwill continue to receive separate proxy cards \nbased on their registered ownership of Truist \ncommon stock.

In    \naddition to satisfying the foregoing          \nrequirements under our bylaws, to comply with \nthe universal proxy rules, shareholders who   \nintend to solicit proxies in support of       \ndirector nominees other than Truist\u2019s nominees\nmust provide notice to Truist that sets forth \nthe information required by SEC Rule 14a-19no \nlater than March 2, 2026.

Typically, the Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee adjusts Truist\u2019s GAAP \nresults for items such as gains or losses on  \nsales of businesses, restructuring charges,   \nand similar non-coreperformance items, on a   \npre-taxbasis, provided the adjustment is not  \nsolely a tax-relateditem. These adjustments   \nare made so that participants are compensated \nfor Truist\u2019s core performance in comparison to\nplanned levels and are neither penalized nor  \nrewarded for non-corecharges, unusual gains,  \nor similar non-coreevents. Senior management  \nalso uses these financial measures in         \nevaluating Truist\u2019s financial performance. To \nthe extent practicable, the Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee also makes similar    \nadjustments to the reported performance of    \npeer group members when assessing Truist\u2019s    \nperformance relative to the peer group. The   \nadjustments for 2024 affect the EPS, PPNR, and\nNIE performance metrics for the AIP awards and\nthe three-year average ROACE and ROATCE for   \nLTIP and PSU purposes. Each of these adjusted \nfinancial measures is determined by methods   \nother than in accordance with GAAP and are    \nthus non-GAAPmetrics. The EPS, PPNR, and NIE  \nmeasures are calculated in the same manner as \ntheir GAAP or unadjusted counterparts, except \nthat the Compensation and Human Capital       \nCommittee approved adjustments shown in the   \ntables below are taken into account in the    \ncalculations. In addition, the calculation of \nEPS uses a different number of weighted       \naverage shares outstanding than the           \ncalculation of GAAP earnings per share for    \nperiods ended with a net loss available to    \ncommon shareholders from continuing           \noperations, which was the case in 2023 and    \n2024, as described in footnote (2) to the     \ntable below. Tangible common equity per common\nshare, which is a component of a primary      \nfinancial metric assessed in the AIP award    \nprogram (TBVPS plus dividend growth), is a    \nnon-GAAPfinancial measure that excludes the   \nimpact of intangible assets, net of deferred  \ntaxes. A reconciliation from common           \nshareholders\u2019 equity to tangible common       \nshareholders\u2019 equity is shown in the third    \ntable below. Please refer to the LTIP and PSU \nadjustments table and accompanying narratives \nbelow for additional detail on the adjusted   \nROACE and ROATCE calculations and GAAP        \nreconciliations. 2024 Adjusted Financial      \nMetrics for Annual Incentive Performance Award\n                                              \n        Adju\u2026                                 \n        Net                                   \n        Inco\u2026                                 \n        and                                   \n        EPS                                   \n        ($ in                                 \n        mill\u2026                                 \n        exce\u2026                                 \n        per                                   \n        share                                 \n        data;                                 \n        shar\u2026         Dec.
