and results of operations,\nincluding through increased expenses, reduced\nfee income and net interest margin, decreased\ndemand for certain types of loans, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses;\na resurgence of the pandemic, whether due to\nnew variants of the coronavirus or other\nfactors, could reintroduce or prolong these\nnegative impacts and also adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s capital and liquidity position or\ncost of capital, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an\noutflow of deposits, and impair goodwill or\nother assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist

to\nsuccessfully complete or integrate mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\n\u2022 increased competition, including from (i)\nnew or existing competitors that could have\ngreater financial resources or be subject to\ndifferent regulatory standards, and (ii)\nproducts and services offered by non-bank\nfinancial technology companies, may reduce\nTruist\u2019s client base, cause Truist to lower\nprices for its products and services in order\nto maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public

the\nfederal government and its agencies, including\nin response to rising inflation, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the economy and\nTruist\u2019s profitability;\n\n\u2022 accounting policies and processes require\nmanagement to make estimates about matters\nthat are uncertain, including the potential\nwrite down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, including as\na result of supply chain disruptions,\ninflationary pressures and labor shortages,\nand instability in global geopolitical matters\nor volatility in financial markets could\nresult in, among other things, slower deposit\nor asset growth, a deterioration in credit\nquality, or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance, or other services;\n\n\u2022 risks related to originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an

teammates, and if these\nindividuals leave or change roles without\neffective replacements, Truist\u2019s operations\nand integration activities could be adversely\nimpacted, which could be exacerbated in the\nincreased work-from-home environment caused by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic as job markets may be\nless constrained by physical geography;\n\n\u2022 fraud or misconduct by internal or external\nparties, which Truist may not be able to\nprevent, detect, or mitigate;\n\n\u2022 security risks, including denial of service\nattacks, hacking, social engineering attacks\ntargeting

These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. There were\nno significant changes to the Company\u2019s\naccounting policies from those disclosed in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 that could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods.

Management determined that it has\nboth the positive intent and ability to hold\nthese securities to maturity. On the date of\ntransfer, the difference between the par value\nand the fair value of these securities, which\nwas recorded as a loss in AOCI, resulted in a\nnet discount of $ 3.7billion, inclusive of $\n510million of basis adjustment gains from\nterminated fair value hedges attributable to\nthe transferred securities. The discount will\nbe accreted and unrealized loss in AOCI will\nbe amortized, offsetting within interest\nincome over the remaining life of the\nsecurities using the interest method. There\nwere no gains or losses recognized as a result\nof this transfer.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of\ncertain MBS securities issued by FNMA and\nFHLMC that exceeded 10% of shareholders\u2019\nequity are shown in the table below:\n                                              \n                   September                  \n                         30,                  \n                        2022                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars         Amortized            Fair  \n  in                    Cost           Value  \n  millions)                                   \n  FNMA         $      43,028    $     36,065  \n  FHLMC               43,545          36,239  \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n                                              \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n             2                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026                                \n             \u2014                                \n             \u2026      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \nAt September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nnoACL was established for AFS or HTM\nsecurities.

and\n$ 246million and the consumer ALLL increased $\n78million and $ 16million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2022,\nrespectively. The decrease in the commercial\nALLL primarily reflects continued strong\ncommercial portfolio performance and loan\ngrowth concentrated in higher quality loans,\npartially offset by a moderately slower\neconomic outlook. The increase in the consumer\nALLL was primarily driven by loan growth,\nnormalizing loss trends in certain consumer\nportfolios, and a moderately slower economic\noutlook. Considerations for the moderately\nslower economic outlook include the potential\nimpacts related to Hurricane Ian, and risks\nassociated with inflation, rising rates,\nsupply chain disruption, geopolitical events,\nand recession.\n\nThe RUFC increased $ 3million and decreased $\n10million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, respectively.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nUS real GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates, property values, the primary 30-year\nmortgage rate, home price indices, and used\ncar prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the September 30, 2022 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2021. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, each\nforecast scenario reflected a moderate\ndeterioration in certain economic variables\nover the reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod when compared to the prior period. The\nprimary economic forecast shaping the ACL\nestimate at September 30, 2022 included GDP\ngrowth in the low-single digits and an\nunemployment rate starting in the low-single\ndigits with a slight increase towards mid-\nsingle digits by the end of the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The September\n30, 2022 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases.

The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of September 30,\n2022. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. In addition,\nthe matters underlying this estimate will\nchange from time to time. Estimated losses are\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolve considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived, and seeks damages on a class-wide\nbasis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nCompany previously filed a motion to amend the\nclass definition in which it sought to narrow\nthe scope of the class and renewed motions to\ncompel arbitration against certain class\nmembers, which the court found were premature.\nOn September 22, 2022, the trial court entered\na scheduling order holding that the court will\nconsider such motions after discovery is\ncompleted. The Company continues to believe\nthat the underlying claims are without merit.\n\nUnited Services Automobile Association v.\nTruist Bank\n\nUSAA filed a lawsuit on July 29, 2022 against\nthe Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nalleging that the Company\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe certain\npatents held by USAA. The complaint seeks\ndamages, including for alleged willful\ninfringement and a corresponding request that\nthe amount of actual damages be trebled, as\nwell as injunctive and other equitable relief.\nThe Company filed its answer and affirmative\ndefenses on October 11, 2022, denying USAA\u2019s\nclaims, including its claims of willful\ninfringement. Also on October 11, 2022, the\nCompany filed a petition for inter partes\nreview challenging the validity of one of the\npatents asserted in the lawsuit.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

ROU assets are\nmeasured based on the fair value of the\nassets, which considers the potential for\nsublease income. The remaining assets are\nmeasured at LOCOM, less costs to sell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At September 30,\n2022, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 16 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

While some states have already\nadopted LIBOR legislation, the federal\nlegislation expressly preempts any provision\nof any state or local law, statute, rule,\nregulation, or standard.\n\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule\nto increase initial base deposit insurance\nassessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis\npoints, beginning on January 1, 2023. This\nrule is expected to increase regulatory\npremiums by approximately $100 million\nannually. The FDIC also concurrently\nmaintained the Designated Reserve Ratio for\nthe DIF at 2%.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nOur third quarter 2022 performance reflects\nstrong progress in many areas of the business,\nas we delivered strong broad-based loan\ngrowth, significant margin expansion and\ncontinued exceptional asset quality.

On a diluted per common share basis,\nearnings for the third quarter of 2022 were\n$1.15, a decrease of $0.05, or 4.2%, compared\nto the third quarter of 2021. Truist\u2019s results\nof operations for the third quarter of 2022\nproduced an annualized return on average\nassets of 1.19% and an annualized return on\naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity of 10.7%\ncompared to prior year returns of 1.28% and\n10.2%, respectively.\n\nResults for the third quarter of 2022 included\nmerger-related and restructuring charges of\n$62 million ($48 million after-tax) and\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger of $90 million ($69 million after-tax).\nResults for the third quarter of 2021 included\n$172 million ($132 million after-tax) of\nmerger-related and restructuring charges, $191\nmillion ($147 million after-tax) of\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger, and a one-time professional fee to\ndevelop an ongoing program to identify,\nprioritize, and roadmap teammate generated\nrevenue growth and expense savings\nopportunities beyond the Merger of $30 million\n($23 million after tax).\n\nOn a TE basis, revenue was $5.9 billion for\nthe third quarter of 2022, an increase of $259\nmillion, or 4.6%, compared to the same period\nin 2021. TE net interest income for the third\nquarter of 2022 was up $522 million, or 16%,\ncompared to the earlier quarter primarily due\nto strong loan growth, higher market interest\nrates coupled with well controlled deposit\ncosts and solid deposit growth. These\nincreases were partially offset by lower\npurchase accounting accretion and lower PPP\nrevenue. Average earning assets increased\n$20.6 billion, or 4.5%, compared to the\nearlier quarter primarily due to growth in\naverage total loans of $21.5 billion, or 7.4%.\nAverage deposits increased $17.4 billion, or\n4.3%, and average short-term borrowings\nincreased $12.0 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter, while average long-term debt\ndecreased $5.9 billion, or 16%.\n\nNet interest margin was 3.12%, up 31 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter. The\nyield on the total loan portfolio for the\nthird quarter of 2022 was 4.49%, up 59 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter,\nprimarily reflecting higher market interest\nrates, partially offset by lower purchase\naccounting accretion and lower PPP revenue.\nThe yield on the average securities portfolio\nwas 1.95%, up 45 basis points compared to the\nearlier quarter primarily due to the higher\nrate environment.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.31%,\nup 28 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter. The average cost of short-term\nborrowings was 2.34%, up 166 basis points\ncompared to the earlier quarter. The average\ncost of long-term debt was 2.43%, up 82 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter. The\nincrease in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $234\nmillion, compared to a benefit of $324 million\nfor the earlier quarter. The earlier quarter\nincluded a reserve release due to the\nimproving credit environment during that\nperiod. Net charge-offs for the third quarter\nof 2022 totaled $213 million compared to $135\nmillion in the earlier quarter. The net\ncharge-off ratio for the current quarter of\n0.27% was up eight basis points compared to\nthe earlier quarter primarily driven by\nnormalizing trends across certain consumer\nportfolios.\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of\n2022 decreased $263 million, or 11%, compared\nto the earlier quarter. Other income decreased\n$139 million due to valuation changes from\nassets held for certain post-retirement\nbenefits, which is primarily offset by lower\npersonnel expense, and lower investment income\nand valuation marks from the Company\u2019s SBIC\nand other strategic investments. Residential\nmortgage income decreased $107 million, or\n60%, as lower production income (due to lower\nmargins and refinance volumes resulting from\nthe higher rate environment) was partially\noffset by higher servicing income (due to\nlower prepayments and servicing portfolio\npurchases). Investment banking and trading\nincome decreased $94 million, or 30%, due to\nlower bond and equity originations and merger\nand acquisition fees, partially offset by\nhigher trading income. These decreases were\npartially offset by an increase of $80\nmillion, or 12%, in insurance income due to\norganic growth and acquisitions.\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of\n2022 was down $182 million, or 4.8%, compared\nto the earlier quarter. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges decreased $110 million\nand incremental operating expenses related to\nthe Merger decreased $101 million due to\ndiminishing integration-related activities.\nThe earlier quarter included a $30 million\nprofessional fee to develop an ongoing program\nto identify, prioritize, and roadmap teammate\ngenerated revenue growth and expense savings\nopportunities beyond the Merger.\n\n40 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nExcluding the aforementioned items and the\namortization of intangibles, adjusted\nnoninterest expense increased $64 million, or\n2.0%, compared to the earlier quarter. Other\nexpense increased $81 million ($87 million, or\n104%, on an adjusted basis) primarily due to\nincreased operational losses and teammate\ntravel expenses. Professional fees and outside\nprocessing expenses decreased $20 million, but\nwas up $70 million, or 33%, on an adjusted\nbasis due to increased project spend for\nenterprise technology investments and\nincreased call center staffing. Equipment\nexpense decreased $32 million ($38 million, or\n25%, on an adjusted basis) primarily due to\nlaptop purchases in the prior period. Software\nexpense decreased $26 million ($24 million, or\n9.6%, on an adjusted basis) primarily due to\nlower maintenance expense and decommissioned\nsoftware. Personnel expense decreased $71\nmillion ($32 million, or 1.5%, on an adjusted\nbasis) due to lower other employee benefits as\na result of the decrease in noninterest income\nfor post-retirement benefits and lower\nincentives, partially offset by higher\nsalaries due to annual merit increases,\ninvestments in revenue producing businesses\nand enterprise technology, as well as\nadditional personnel costs for acquisitions.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $363\nmillion for the third quarter of 2022,\ncompared to $423 million for the earlier\nquarter. The effective tax rate for the third\nquarter of 2022 was 18.2%, compared to 19.9%\nfor the earlier quarter. The decrease in the\neffective tax rate was primarily driven by an\nincrease in discrete tax benefits and changes\nin the full year forecasted effective tax\nrate.\n\nTruist\u2019s total assets at September 30, 2022\nwere $548.4 billion, an increase of $7.2\nbillion, or 1.3%, compared to December 31,\n2021. Total loans and leases at September 30,\n2022, were $316.6 billion, an increase of\n$22.3 billion, or 7.6% compared with December\n31, 2021. The increase in loans reflects\nstrong production during the second and third\nquarters of this year across most industry\nverticals and product groups in the commercial\nand industrial portfolio and the majority of\nthe consumer portfolios. Total deposits at\nSeptember 30, 2022 were $416.0 billion, a\ndecrease of $496 million, or 0.1%, compared to\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nAsset quality remains excellent, reflecting\nTruist\u2019s prudent risk culture and diverse\nportfolio. Nonperforming loans and leases held\nfor investment were 0.35% of loans and leases\nheld for investment at September 30, 2022,\ndown one basis point compared to June 30,\n2022. The ALLL ratio was 1.34% compared to\n1.38% for second quarter 2022. The ALLL\ncoverage ratio was 4.98X annualized net\ncharge-offs, versus 6.54X for second quarter\n2022.\n\nTruist maintained strong capital and liquidity\nlevels relative to the company\u2019s risk profile.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the CET1 ratio was\n9.1% and the average LCR for the third quarter\nof 2022 was 111%. The decline in the CET1\nratio compared to June 30, 2022 primarily\nreflects the BenefitMall acquisition and\nstrong loan growth. Truist increased its\nquarterly common dividend 8% to $0.52 per\nshare in the third quarter of 2022, resulting\nin a dividend payout ratio of 45% for the\nthird quarter of 2022. Truist entered into an\nagreement to purchase BankDirect Capital\nFinance, the insurance premium finance unit of\nTexas Capital Bancshares, which is anticipated\nto close in the fourth quarter of 2022. This\nwill add approximately $3.2 billion in loans\nand deploys 15 basis points of capital.

While integration\nactivities are largely complete, the Board and\nExecutive Leadership oversee the change\nmanagement program, which is designed to\nensure appropriate oversight of application\nand data center decommissioning and residual\nintegration activities, achieved through\nTruist\u2019s risk management process.\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist utilizes a tiered\ndeposit beta assumption framework that\naccounts for historically observed behaviors\nof clients and the Company. As interest rates\nrise, the deposit beta assumptions also rise\nto reflect increasing competition among banks\nas well as increased client demand for\ninterest-bearing deposits. Based on the\nFederal funds target range at September 30,\n2022 of 3.00% to 3.25%, Truist applies an\naverage deposit beta of approximately 50% for\nany additional increases in the Federal funds\nrate. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 50 and 100 rate scenarios\nincorporate a floor of one basis point.\n\nRate sensitivity decreased compared to prior\nperiods, primarily driven by higher starting\nrates, higher deposit betas as rates increase\nand move into the highest beta tiers, and the\naddition of forward starting swaps.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nmay increase interest-bearing funds to offset\nthe loss of this advantageous funding source.\nAlternatively, the Company may reduce the size\nof its investment portfolio to offset the loss\nof noninterest-bearing demand deposits to\nlimit the impact on the balance sheet\u2019s asset\nsensitivity.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at\n100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  18:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resu\u2026                 \n  Grad\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assu\u2026                 \n  Chan\u2026        at           a                 \n  in       Septe\u2026       Decr\u2026                 \n  Rates       30,          in                 \n  (bps)      2022       Noni\u2026                 \n              (1)       Dema\u2026                 \n                        Depo\u2026                 \n              $20         $40                 \n           Billi\u2026       Bill\u2026                 \n  Up         0.37  %    -0.29  %    -0.96  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      0.39       -0.10       -0.58     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at September 30, 2022 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nand mortgage banking operations, long-term\ndebt, and other funding sources. Truist has\nutilized derivatives to facilitate\ntransactions on behalf of its clients and as\npart of associated hedging activities. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, Truist had derivative\nfinancial instruments outstanding with\nnotional amounts totaling $336.1 billion, with\nan associated net negative fair value of $2.3\nbillion.

Tenors used infrequently\nby Truist, including one week and two month\nU.S. dollar LIBOR and all non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, ceased publication at December 31,\n2021, based on the October 20, 2021\ninteragency Joint Statement on Managing the\nLIBOR transition. To prepare for the\ntransition to an alternative reference rate,\nmanagement formed a cross-functional project\nteam to address the LIBOR transition. The\nproject team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, Truist had outstanding\nLIBOR-based instruments that mature after June\n30, 2023, including loan and lease exposures\ntotaling approximately $148 billion, notional\nderivative exposure totaling approximately\n$135 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion,\nand preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These\namounts are inclusive of remediated contracts,\nwhich contain adequate fallback language for\nthe transition.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases has largely been reviewed and\ncertain contracts will require amendments to\nsupport the transition away from LIBOR.\nImpacted lines of business have started\nremediating these contracts to include\nstandardized fallback language, or amending\ncontracts to new reference rates at maturities\nor based on client request. Current fallback\nlanguage used to remediate contracts that\nmature after June 30, 2023 is generally\nconsistent with ARRC recommendations and\nincludes use of \u201chardwired fallback\u201d language,\nwhich will transition loans to a SOFR based\nrate after June 30, 2023.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 59\nThe progress and approach to remediation will\nvary based on the type of contract and\nexisting language used in the agreement. For\ncommercial lending and general consumer\nlending, a significant number of remaining\nLIBOR contracts will require client outreach\nand remediation. Through mid-2022, the\nCompany\u2019s primary focus was contract\nremediation for maturities earlier than June\n30, 2023 and expanding usage of alternative\nreference rates. Efforts have shifted to amend\nand remediate contracts, excluding mortgage\nand student loans, that mature post June 30,\n2023 ($139 billion), which will continue to be\nthe focus during the remainder of 2022. Truist\nhas determined that adjustable rate mortgage\nproducts ($3.6 billion) have consistent and\nadequate fallback language to transition away\nfrom LIBOR in line with industry expectations;\ntherefore, these contracts will not require\nremediation. Remediation of student loans\n($5.2 billion) will follow pending guidance\nfrom the Department of Education on the\nreplacement rate for payment allowances on\ncertain student loans and recent guidance from\nthe CFPB to allow transition to \u201ccomparable\nrates,\u201d in the private student loan portfolio,\nwhere LIBOR is used directly. Certain\nderivatives without a clearly defined or\npracticable replacement benchmark rate will\nuse the recent Federal legislation to replace\nLIBOR with a SOFR-based rate that will be\nestablished by FRB rulemaking and following\nthe ISDA Protocol for transition. This\nlegislation will also provide additional\nadministrative benefit for a small portion of\nthe commercial and consumer lending portfolios\nwhere contracts do not contain fallback\nlanguage and have not yet been remediated,\nproviding a remediation path to a SOFR based\nrate.\n\nTraining has been provided for impacted\nteammates and will continue during 2022.\nTruist will continue to provide timely notices\nand information to impacted clients about the\ntransition during 2022 and the first half of\n2023. Truist continues to manage the impact of\nthese contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and related operational and market\nrisks on established project plans for\nbusiness and operational readiness to support\nthe transition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate for all product offerings,\nexcept on a limited basis, as permissible. The\nCompany is actively using SOFR as a reference\nrate and has originated approximately $80\nbillion of loans, issued $8.4 billion of long-\nterm debt, and has $91 billion in notional\nderivative exposure using this alternative\nreference rate as of September 30, 2022.\nAlternatives, such as SOFR, may react\ndifferently from LIBOR in times of economic\nstress. Truist expects SOFR to be the primary\npricing benchmark used across the industry and\nwill continue to offer additional SOFR based\nproducts. Market risks associated with the\ntransition to alternative reference rates are\ndependent on market conditions as loans are\ntransitioned to alternative reference rates\nduring 2022 and early 2023. Additional\nalternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg\nShort Term Bank Yield will be supported based\non market demand. Other emerging credit\nsensitive rates will be evaluated as\nadditional alternatives for LIBOR based on\nmarket developments. For a further discussion\nof the various risks associated with the\npotential cessation of LIBOR and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates,\nrefer to the section titled \u201cItem1A. Risk\nFactors\u201d in the Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$23 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of September 30, 2022.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths and nine months ended September 30,\n2022 and 2021. Average one and ten-day VaR\nmeasures for the three months ended September\n30, 2022 increased from the same period of\nlast year, primarily driven by higher market\nvolatility in 2022.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, VaR\nmeasures briefly increased in the first\nquarter of 2022 due to the increase in market\nvolatility that normalized towards the end of\nthe quarter. There were no Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions during the twelve\nmonths ended September 30, 2022. The total\nnumber of Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions over the preceding twelve months is\nused to determine the multiplication factor\nfor the VaR-based capital requirement under\nthe Market Risk Rule. The capital\nmultiplication factor increases from a minimum\nof three to a maximum of four, depending on\nthe number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed\nin the context of VaR model use and\nperformance. There was no change in the\ncapital multiplication factor over the\npreceding twelve months.\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $88.6 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 111% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2022.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At September 30,\n2022, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 21:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Sep 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      49,525    $     52,170  \n  FHLB                28,548          49,244  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           96,894         116,600  \n  (after                                      \n  haircuts)                                   \n  Available                                   \n  secured            174,967         218,014  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             16,699          14,714  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     191,666    $    232,728  \n                                              \nAt September 30, 2022, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 3.7 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless. FHLB unused borrowing capacity was $28.5\nbillion at September 30, 2022, down from $49.2\nbillion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to\nincreases in short-term borrowings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Parent Company had 32\nmonths and 35 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n22 months and 19 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nRecent changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings\nand outlooks include:\n\nOn August 15, 2022, DBRS Morningstar upgraded\nthe ratings of Truist, including the Long-Term\nIssuer Rating to \u201cAA (low)\u201d from \u201cA (high).\u201d\nDBRS Morningstar also upgraded the ratings of\nTruist Bank, including the Long-Term Issuer\nRating to \u201cAA\u201d from \u201cAA (low).\u201d The trend for\nall ratings was revised to \u201cStable\u201d from\n\u201cPositive.\u201d The rating actions reflected the\nscale, quality, and diversity of Truist\u2019s\nfranchise; the completion of the Merger\nintegration; Truist\u2019s diversified products and\ngeography; and the Company\u2019s sound balance\nsheet fundamentals and conservative risk\nprofile.\n\nAfter the end of the third quarter, on October\n21, 2022, Fitch Ratings affirmed the ratings\nof Truist and Truist Bank, including the long-\nterm and short-term issuer default ratings at\n\u201cA+\u201d and \u201cF1,\u201d respectively, for both\nentities. Fitch Ratings also maintained a\n\u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook for all ratings. In\naffirming the ratings, Fitch cited Truist\u2019s\ndiverse business model, conservative credit\nculture, and the completion of the Merger\nintegration.\n\nSee Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital targets, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented stress capital\nratio minimum targets to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above minimums specified by the FRB for\nthe annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed\nminimum targets prompt a review of the planned\ncapital actions included in Truist\u2019s capital\nplan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB of 2.5% applicable to\nTruist as of September 30, 2022.
