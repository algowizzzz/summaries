As such, Truist\u2019s actual results may\ndiffer materially from those contemplated by\nforward-looking statements. While there can be\nno assurance that any list of risks and\nuncertainties or risk factors is complete,\nimportant factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from

conditions;\n\n\u2022 inability to access short-term funding or\nliquidity, loss of client deposits or changes\nin Truist\u2019s credit ratings could increase the\ncost of funding, limit access to

including as a result of the\nfinancial or operational failure of a major\nfinancial institution, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a financial\ninstitution or its ability to fulfill its\nobligations, which can cause substantial and\ncascading disruption within the financial\nmarkets and increased expenses, including FDIC\ninsurance premiums, and could affect our\nability to attract and retain depositors and\nto borrow or raise capital;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, including as\na result of supply chain disruptions,\ninflationary pressures and labor shortages,\nand instability in global geopolitical\nmatters, including due to an outbreak or\nescalation of

could fail to execute on strategic or\noperational plans, including the ability to\nsuccessfully complete or integrate mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\n\u2022 increased competition, including from (i)\nnew or existing competitors that could have\ngreater financial resources or be subject to\ndifferent regulatory standards or compliance\ncosts, and (ii) products and services offered\nby non-bank financial technology companies,\nmay reduce Truist\u2019s client base, cause Truist\nto lower prices for its products and services\nin order to maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services, and technology, whether

more stringent\nin light of recent market events, such as\nlong-term debt requirements, and results of\nregulatory examinations may adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations;\n\n\u2022 increased scrutiny regarding Truist\u2019s\nconsumer sales practices, training practices,\nincentive compensation design, and governance\ncould damage its reputation and adversely\nimpact business and revenues;\n\n\u2022 accounting policies and processes require\nmanagement to make estimates about matters\nthat are uncertain, including the potential\nwrite down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 Truist faces risks related to originating\nand selling mortgages, including repurchase\nand indemnity demands from purchasers related\nto representations and warranties on loans\nsold, which could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 there are risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as\na loan servicer, including an increase in the\nscope or costs of the services Truist is\nrequired to perform without any corresponding\nincrease in servicing fees or a breach of\nTruist\u2019s obligations as servicer;\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s success depends on hiring and\nretaining key teammates, and if these\nindividuals leave or change roles without\neffective replacements, Truist\u2019s operations\ncould be adversely impacted, which could be\nexacerbated in the increased work-from-home\nenvironment as job markets may be less\nconstrained by physical geography;\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s operations rely on its ability, and\nthe ability of key external parties,

Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company\nupdated its accounting policies in connection\nwith recently adopted accounting standards,\nwhich are described in this footnote. There\nwere no other significant changes to the\nCompany\u2019s accounting policies from those\ndisclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 that\ncould have a material effect on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial statements.\nReclassifications\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, Truist\nreclassified certain portfolios within the\nconsumer portfolio segment to delineate home\nequity from other consumer portfolios.\nAdditionally, Truist realigned Prime Rate\nPremium Finance Corporation, which includes\nAFCO Credit Corporation and CAFO Holding\nCompany, into the C&CB segment from the IH\nsegment. Prior period results have been\nrevised to conform to the current\npresentation.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, Truist\nupdated its segment cost allocation\nmethodology. Results for the first quarter of\n2023 have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent presentation. Management concluded the\nimpact to 2022 was not material.\nCertain other amounts reported in prior\nperiods\u2019 consolidated financial statements\nhave been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent presentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nLoan Modifications\nIn certain circumstances, the Company enters\ninto agreements to modify the terms of loans\nto borrowers that are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The scope of these loan\nmodifications varies from portfolio to\nportfolio but generally falls into one of the\nfollowing categories:\n\u2022 Renewals: represent the renewal of a loan\nwhere the Company has concluded that the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nCommercial renewals result in an extension of\nthe maturity date of the loan (or in some\ncases a contraction of the loan term), and\nother significant terms of the loan (e.g.,\ninterest rate, collateral, guarantor support,\netc.) are re-evaluated in connection with the\nrenewal event.\n\u2022 Term extensions: represent an adjustment to\nthe maturity date of the loan that typically\nresults in a reduction to the borrower\u2019s\nscheduled payment over the remainder of the\nloan.\n\u2022 Capitalizations: represents the\ncapitalization of forborne loan payments\nand/or other amounts advanced on behalf of the\nborrower into the principal balance of a\nresidential mortgage loan.\n\u2022 Payment delays: provide the borrower with a\ntemporary postponement of loan payments that\nis considered other-than-insignificant, which\nhas been defined as a payment delay that\nexceeds 90 days, or three payment cycles, over\na rolling 12-month period. These postponed\nloan payments may result in an extension of\nthe ultimate maturity date of the loan or may\nbe capitalized into the principal balance of\nthe loan in certain circumstances.\n\u2022 Combinations: in certain circumstances more\nthan one type of a modification is provided to\na borrower (e.g., interest rate reduction and\nterm extension).\n\u2022 Other: represents other types of loan\nmodifications that are not considered\nsignificant for disclosure purposes.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nThe Company has identified borrowers that are\nincluded in the Loan Modifications disclosures\nin \u201cNote 5. Loans and ACL\u201d as follows:\n\n\u2022 Commercial: the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of loans to commercial borrowers\nthat are rated substandard or worse and\nincludes the modifications in its disclosure\nto the extent that the modification is\nconsidered other-than-insignificant.\n\n\u2022 Consumer and credit card: loan modifications\nto consumer and credit card borrowers are\ngenerally limited to borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty. As a\nresult, the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of consumer and credit card\nloans and includes them in the disclosure to\nthe extent that they are considered other-than\ninsignificant.\n\nRefer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 for\naccounting policies related to prior period,\nincluding the Company\u2019s TDR policies.\nALLL\nThe ALLL represents management\u2019s best estimate\nof expected future credit losses related to\nits loan and lease portfolio at the balance\nsheet date. The Company\u2019s ALLL estimation\nprocess gives consideration to relevant\navailable information from internal and\nexternal sources relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The quantitative models\nused to forecast expected credit losses use\nportfolio balances, macroeconomic forecast\ndata, portfolio composition and loan\nattributes as the primary inputs. Loss\nestimates are informed by historical loss\nexperience that includes losses incurred on\nloans that were previously modified by the\nCompany. As a result, the Company has\nconcluded that aside from the limited\ncircumstances where principal forgiveness is\ngranted to a borrower, the financial effect of\nloan modifications is already inherently\nincluded in the ALLL.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified tax credit investments. In\ncomputing the provision for income taxes, the\nCompany evaluates the technical merits of its\nincome tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The proportional amortization method\nof accounting is used on affordable housing\nand other qualified tax credit investments,\nsuch that the initial cost of the investment\ngiving rise to tax credits is amortized in\nproportion to the allocation of tax credits in\neach period as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes.

Business Combinations, Divestitures,\nand Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNoncontrolling Interest\n\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company completed its\nsale of a 20% stake of the common equity in\nIH, which was previously wholly owned by\nTruist, to an investor group led by Stone\nPoint Capital, LLC for $ 1.9billion, with the\nproceeds, net of tax, recognized as an\nincrease to shareholders\u2019 equity. In\nconnection with the transaction, the\nnoncontrolling interest holder received\nprofits interest representing 3.75% coverage\non IH\u2019s fully diluted equity value at\ntransaction close, and certain consent and\nexit rights commensurate with a noncontrolling\ninvestor. Including these profits interests,\nthe noncontrolling interest holder is\nallocated approximately 23% of IH pretax net\nincome. The transaction allows Truist to\nmaintain strategic flexibility and future\nupside in IH, which will continue to benefit\nfrom Truist\u2019s operations, access to capital,\nand client relationships, while creating\nadditional opportunities for the growth of IH\nthrough the support of a strong blue-chip\ninvestor in Stone Point Capital, LLC. Also in\nconjunction with the same transaction, IH\ngranted certain event-vested profits interests\nand appreciation units, representing 4.50%\ncoverage on IH\u2019s fully diluted equity value at\ngrant, to various IH employees and officers in\nthe second quarter of 2023. These awards,\nsubject to continued employment through the\napplicable event or date, will vest either\nupon, or from 6 months to two years following,\na change in control of IH, depending on the\nnature of the change in control. No\ncompensation expense is recognized for these\nevent-vested awards until such an event is\nprobable. The Company intends these awards to\nstrengthen IH\u2019s ability to incent and retain\ntop talent, and realize IH\u2019s full potential.\n                                              \n  NOTE 3.

Charge-\noffs include $ 98million related to the sale.\n\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 212million and\n$ 368million and the consumer ALLL decreased $\n95million and $ 144million during the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023,\nrespectively. The increase in the commercial\nALLL primarily reflects loan growth and an\nupdated economic outlook. The decrease in the\nconsumer ALLL was primarily driven by the sale\nof the student portfolio in the current\nquarter as well as first quarter 2023 impacts\nassociated with the adoption of the Troubled\nDebt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosure\naccounting standard. Considerations for the\nupdated economic outlook include the potential\nimpacts related to the risks associated with\ninflation, rising rates, geopolitical events,\nand recession.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nU.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nrental rates, property values, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the June 30, 2023 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2022. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, each\nforecast scenario reflected deterioration in\ncertain economic variables over the reasonable\nand supportable forecast period when compared\nto the prior period. The overall economic\nforecast shaping the ACL estimate at June 30,\n2023 included GDP growth in the low-single\ndigits and an unemployment rate near mid-\nsingle digits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The June 30,\n2023 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third-party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases.

The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral. The following table provides\nthe total carrying amount of pledged assets by\nasset type:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pledged      $      40,590    $     38,012  \n  securiti\u2026                                   \n  Pledged                                     \n  loans:                                      \n  FRB                 72,823          71,234  \n  FHLB                68,987          68,988  \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB                 52,737          49,250  \n  FHLB                23,219          20,770  \n                                              \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nTruist and/or its subsidiaries are routinely\nnamed as defendants in or parties to numerous\nactual or threatened legal proceedings,\nincluding civil litigation and regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement matters, arising\nfrom the ordinary conduct of its regular\nbusiness activities. The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of June 30,\n2023. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company deemed the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nwill change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses are based upon currently available\ninformation and involve considerable judgment,\ngiven that claims often include significant\nlegal uncertainties, damages alleged by\nplaintiffs are often unspecified or\noverstated, discovery may not have started or\nmay not be complete, and material facts may be\ndisputed or unsubstantiated, among other\nfactors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived, and seeks damages on a class-wide\nbasis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nCompany previously filed a motion to amend the\nclass definition in which it sought to narrow\nthe scope of the class and renewed motions to\ncompel arbitration against certain class\nmembers, which the court found were premature.\nOn September 22, 2022, the trial court entered\na scheduling order holding that the court will\nconsider such motions after discovery, which\nis ongoing, is completed. Trial is presently\nset to commence on April 29, 2024. The Company\ncontinues to believe that the underlying\nclaims are without merit.\n\nUnited Services Automobile Association v.\nTruist Bank\n\nUSAA filed a lawsuit on July 29, 2022 against\nthe Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nalleging that the Company\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe three patents\nheld by USAA. The complaint seeks damages,\nincluding for alleged willful infringement and\na corresponding request that the amount of\nactual damages be trebled, as well as\ninjunctive and other equitable relief. The\nCompany filed its answer and affirmative\ndefenses on October 11, 2022, denying that it\ninfringes any of the patents at issue in the\nlawsuit and asserting that USAA\u2019s patents are\ninvalid or unenforceable. On December 30,\n2022, the Company filed a motion for leave to\namend its answer to assert counterclaims\nseeking damages as well as injunctive relief\nagainst USAA for infringing four patents owned\nby the Company and practiced by USAA\u2019s mobile\nremote deposit capture systems. On March 13,\n2023, USAA filed a motion for leave to file a\nfirst amended complaint asserting infringement\nclaims related to a fourth USAA patent. On\nApril 8, 2023, the Company\u2019s motion for leave\nto amend its answer to assert counterclaims\nwas granted. On April 14, 2023, USAA filed a\nmotion seeking to sever the Company\u2019s\ncounterclaims from the case, and on May 1,\n2023, USAA filed a motion to dismiss claims\nrelated to two of the counterclaim patents. On\nMay 3, 2023, USAA filed a motion for leave to\nfile a second amended complaint asserting\ninfringement claims related to a fifth USAA\npatent. On May 15, 2023, the Company filed a\nmotion for leave to file a second amended\nanswer and counterclaims to bring claims\nagainst USAA for infringement related to two\nadditional patents owned by the Company. On\nJune 21, 2023, the district court entered an\norder granting both USAA\u2019s and the Company\u2019s\npending motions for leave to amend their\npleadings. On June 27, 2023, USAA filed an\nupdated motion to sever, seeking to sever the\ntwo additional patents asserted by Truist from\nthe case, and USAA also moved to dismiss\nclaims related to these patents on July 6,\n2023. Discovery in the district court\nproceedings is ongoing, and trial is presently\nset to commence on March 18, 2024.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nAt the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the\nCompany filed separate petitions for inter\npartes review on October 11, November 7, and\nNovember 15, 2022 challenging the validity of\neach of the first three patents asserted by\nUSAA in the lawsuit. In addition, on April 13,\n2023, the Company filed a petition for inter\npartes review challenging the validity of the\nfourth patent USAA added to the lawsuit. On\nMay 16, 2023, the Patent Trial and Appeal\nBoard denied institution of the Company\u2019s\npetitions for inter partes review challenging\none of the first three USAA patents, and the\nCompany has filed a Request for Rehearing by\nthe Director of one of the decisions denying\ninstitution. On May 18 and June 14, 2023, the\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board granted\ninstitution of the Company\u2019s petitions for\ninter partes review challenging the second and\nthird patents originally brought by USAA in\nits lawsuit. For those patents for which\ninstitution of the petitions for inter partes\nreview has been granted, the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board will review the validity of the\nclaims in the applicable patent(s) upon\nfurther proceedings which will include\nbriefing by the parties and a hearing before\nthe assigned panel.\n\nRecordkeeping Matters\n\nThe SEC and CFTC have requested information\nfrom various subsidiaries of the Company that\nconduct broker-dealer, investment adviser, and\nswap dealer activities regarding compliance\nwith applicable recordkeeping requirements for\nbusiness-related electronic communications.\nThe Company is cooperating with these\nrequests. The SEC and CFTC have been\nconducting similar investigations of other\nfinancial institutions regarding business-\nrelated communications sent over unapproved\nelectronic messaging channels and have entered\ninto a number of resolutions with various\ninstitutions to date.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the FDIC\nissued a proposed rule to impose a special\nassessment to recover the losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund following the recent\nbank failures. The assessment would be based\non an insured depository institution\u2019s\nestimated uninsured deposits reported as of\nDecember 31, 2022. If the final rule is\nadopted as proposed, the special assessment\nfor Truist is estimated at approximately $460\nmillion to be recognized at the time the rule\nis finalized and paid in eight quarterly\ninstallments beginning in the first quarter of\n2024. The actual assessment may vary as a\nresult of the final rule, including any\nchanges to the calculation methodology.\nAdditionally, the FDIC would have the ability\nto cease collection early, extend the\ncollection period to collect any difference\nbetween the estimated and actual losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund, and impose a final\nshortfall assessment on a one-time basis.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Valuation adjustments for loans\nand leases are primarily recorded in the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Refer to\n\u201cNote 1.

ROU assets are\nmeasured based on the fair value of the\nassets, which considers the potential for\nsublease income. The remaining assets are\nmeasured at LOCOM, less costs to sell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets.

banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At June 30, 2023,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 14 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\n40 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

Operating Segments\u201d of the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, Truist\nrealigned Prime Rate Premium Finance\nCorporation, which includes AFCO Credit\nCorporation and CAFO Holding Company, into the\nC&CB segment from the IH segment. Prior period\nresults have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent presentation. During the second\nquarter of 2023, Truist updated its segment\ncost allocation methodology. Results for the\nfirst quarter of 2023 have been revised to\nconform to the current presentation.\nManagement concluded the impact to 2022 was\nnot material.\n\nIn conjunction with the Company\u2019s April 3,\n2023 sale of a 20% stake of the common equity\nin IH, IH issued $ 5.0billion of 8.25%\nmandatorily redeemable preferred units to the\nCompany, with the related interest expense,\nwhich is fully allocable to the Company,\nreported in Net intersegment interest income\n(expense).\n\nAlso related to the same transaction, IH was\nrecapitalized from a corporate entity to an\nLLC, such that each member is allocated its\nshare of IH\u2019s income before taxes, and\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2023 the\nCompany recognizes its associated income tax\nprovision through Other, Treasury & Corporate.\nThe Company elected not to restate prior\nperiods for this change based on IH\u2019s previous\nstatus as a corporate entity. The Company\nrecognized $ 54million for the second quarter\n2023 tax provision related to IH in Other,\nTreasury & Corporate.\n\n42 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 43\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. The\ndescriptions below summarize updates since the\nfiling of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 to state and\nfederal laws to which Truist is subject. These\ndescriptions do not summarize all possible or\nproposed changes in current laws or\nregulations and are not intended to be a\nsubstitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions. Refer to Truist\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional disclosures.\n\nIn March 2023, the FRB created the Bank Term\nFunding Program to support American businesses\nand households by making additional funding\navailable to eligible depository institutions.\nThis program offers loans up to one year in\nlength to banks, savings associations, credit\nunions, and other eligible depository\ninstitutions pledging any collateral eligible\nfor purchase by the FRB in open market\noperations, such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S.\nagency securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-\nbacked securities. These assets will be valued\nat par.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent bank failures,\nwe expect that the banking agencies will\npropose certain actions, including reforms\nthat may impose different capital and\nliquidity requirements, including increased\nrequirements to issue long term debt. On July\n27, 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued\nthe first proposal to revise the risk-based\ncapital standards applicable to the Company\nand Truist Bank. We continue to evaluate the\nproposal and the potential impacts, if adopted\nas proposed, on the Company\u2019s and Truist\nBank\u2019s capital requirements.\n\nIn addition, the FDIC proposed a special\nassessment to repay losses to the FDIC\u2019s\nDeposit Insurance Fund. If the final rule is\nadopted as proposed, the special assessment\nfor Truist is estimated at approximately $460\nmillion to be recognized at the time the rule\nis finalized and paid in eight quarterly\ninstallments beginning in the first quarter of\n2024. Refer to the \u201cNote 14. Commitments and\nContingencies\u201d for additional information\nrelated to the FDIC\u2019s special assessments.\n\nOn July 26, 2023, the SEC finalized rules\nrequiring registrants to disclose material\ncybersecurity incidents that they experience\non Form 8-K and to disclose on an annual basis\nmaterial information regarding their\ncybersecurity risk management, strategy, and\ngovernance. Annual disclosures will be\nrequired in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended 2023. The Form 8-K\ndisclosure requirements will become effective\nbeginning on the later of 90 days after\npublication of the final rules in the Federal\nRegister or December 18, 2023.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nDuring the second quarter, we continued to\nmake progress adapting to the new operating\nenvironment by strengthening our balance sheet\nand sharpening our strategic focus on our core\nbusinesses.\n\nSecond quarter financial results were mixed as\nrevenue headwinds from higher funding costs\nand lower-than-anticipated capital markets\nactivity were partially offset by record\ninsurance income. We prudently increased our\nprovision and allowance amid the uncertain\neconomic backdrop. Adjusted expenses were up\nas anticipated for the quarter. However, we\nare accelerating our plans to adjust our cost\nbase to reflect efficiency opportunities and\nchanging conditions.\n\nOur CET1 capital ratio increased 50 basis\npoints driven by the investment in IH and\norganic capital generation. The most recent\nFRB stress test highlighted our capacity to\nrespond to stressed scenarios and we announced\nplans to maintain our strong quarterly common\nstock dividend at $0.52 per share, subject to\nboard approval.\n\nWe are executing on our strategy to optimize\nour core businesses exemplified by the sale of\nour non-core student loan portfolio at net\ncarrying value with no income impact.

These increases were\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion. Net interest margin was 2.91%, up\ntwo basis points.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the total loan portfolio was\n6.07%, up 216 basis points, primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion.

Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and incremental\noperating expenses related to the merger\ndecreased $67 million and $117 million,\nrespectively, due to the completion of\nintegration-related activities. Adjusted\nnoninterest expenses, which exclude merger-\nrelated costs, the amortization of\nintangibles, and the aforementioned gains and\nlosses on the early extinguishment of debt\nincreased $321 million, or 9.9%.\n\nThe effective tax rate decreased compared to\nthe second quarter of 2022 primarily driven by\nlower income before taxes.\n\nAsset quality reflects normalization and\nmodest deterioration in commercial portfolios.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment were 0.47% of loans and leases held\nfor investment at June 30, 2023, up 11 basis\npoints compared to March 31, 2023.

The ALLL ratio was 1.43%, up six\nbasis points compared with March 31, 2023\nprimarily due to an updated economic outlook.\nThe ALLL covered nonperforming loans and\nleases held for investment 3.0X compared to\n3.8X at March 31, 2023. At June 30, 2023, the\nALLL was 2.6X annualized net charge-offs,\ncompared to 3.7X at March 31, 2023. The ALLL\nto annualized net charge-offs for the current\nquarter was impacted by the charge-off related\nto the sale of the student loan portfolio.\nExcluding the impact from the student loan\ncharge-offs, the ALLL to annualized net\ncharge-offs was 3.4X at June 30, 2023.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table presents an allocation of\nthe ALLL.

Truist also\nreceives notification when the first lien\nholder, whether Truist or another financial\ninstitution, has initiated foreclosure\nproceedings against the borrower. When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nTruist estimates credit losses on second lien\nloans where the first lien is delinquent based\non historical experience; the increased risk\nof loss on these credits is reflected in the\nALLL. As of June 30, 2023, Truist held or\nserviced the first lien on 32% of its second\nlien positions.\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 14:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life         $       7,667    $      7,618  \n  insurance                                   \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other            6,943           6,825  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension              5,927           4,539  \n  assets                                      \n  DTAs                 2,682           3,027  \n  Accounts             3,129           2,682  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Accrued              2,133           2,265  \n  income                                      \n  Leased                                      \n  assets                                      \n  and                  2,045           2,082  \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  FHLB                 1,258           1,279  \n  stock                                       \n  ROU                  1,128           1,193  \n  assets                                      \n  Prepaid              1,204           1,162  \n  expenses                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  securiti\u2026              910             898  \n  at fair                                     \n  value                                       \n  Derivati\u2026              805             684  \n  assets                                      \n  Other                  598             874  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $      36,429    $     35,128  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 61\n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       M\u2026       \u2026       S\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \nAverage deposits for the second quarter of\n2023 were $399.8 billion, a decrease of $8.6\nbillion, or 2.1%, compared to the prior\nquarter. The decrease in deposits was\nprimarily due to the impact of client tax\npayments and prior quarter activity.\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n5.6% compared to the prior quarter and\nrepresented 30.9% of total deposits for the\nsecond quarter of 2023 compared to 32.1% for\nthe first quarter of 2023 and 35.1% compared\nto the year ago quarter. Average interest\nchecking and money market and savings declined\n6.2% and 1.2%, respectively, compared to the\nprior quarter. Average time deposits increased\n25% due to an increase in retail client time\ndeposits primarily due to migration from other\ndeposit products and brokered time deposits.\nAverage brokered deposits were $26.2 billion,\nup $5.0 billion compared to the prior quarter.\n\nTruist has a very granular and relationship-\nbased deposit franchise. Approximately 63% of\ndeposits are insured or collateralized. Truist\ndeposit accounts are typically based on long-\nterm relationships and include multiple\nproducts and services.\n\nThe estimated amount of deposits that are\nuninsured was $171.8 billion, $175.9 billion,\nand $189.6 billion as of June 30, 2023, March\n31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively,\ncalculated using the same methodology as the\nCall Report for Truist Bank. The decrease in\nuninsured deposits from December 31, 2022 to\nJune 30, 2023 was largely due to commercial\nclients that chose to diversify into money\nmarket mutual funds or across multiple banks\nlate in the first quarter. These outflows were\nprimarily higher-cost, non-operational\ndeposits.\n\nBorrowings\n\nAt June 30, 2023, short-term borrowings\ntotaled $24.5 billion, an increase of $1.0\nbillion compared to December 31, 2022. Average\nshort-term borrowings were $24.0 billion, or\n4.9% of total funding, for the six months\nended June 30, 2023, as compared to $8.3\nbillion, or 1.8%, for the same period in the\nprior year.\n\nLong-term debt provides funding and, to a\nlesser extent, regulatory capital, and\nprimarily consists of senior and subordinated\nnotes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-\nterm debt totaled $44.7 billion at June 30,\n2023, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to\nDecember 31, 2022. During the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, the Company had:\n\n\u2022 Maturities and redemptions of $4.0 billion\nof senior notes.\n\n\u2022 Issued $6.3 billion fixed-to-floating rate\nsenior notes with interest rates between 4.87%\nand 6.05% due from June 8, 2027 to June 8,\n2034.\n\n\u2022 Net redemptions of $500 million of FHLB\nfloating rate advances as issuances in the\nfirst quarter of 2023 were redeemed in the\nsecond quarter.\n\nIn July 2023, Truist announced it will redeem\nall $500 million principal amount outstanding\nof its 3.69% fixed-to-floating rate senior\nbank notes due August 2, 2024 on the\nredemption date of August 2, 2023.\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nShareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nTruist\u2019s book value per common share and TBVPS\nare presented in the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 16:                                   \n  Book                                        \n  Value per                                   \n  Common                                      \n  Share                                       \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                                          \n  millions,                                   \n  except                                      \n  per share                                   \n  data,                                       \n  shares in          Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  thousand\u2026             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Common                                      \n  equity                                      \n  per          $       42.68    $      40.58  \n  common                                      \n  share                                       \n  Non-GAAP                                    \n  capital                                     \n  measure:\u2026                                   \n  Tangible                                    \n  common                                      \n  equity       $       20.44    $      18.04  \n  per                                         \n  common                                      \n  share                                       \n  Calculat\u2026                                   \n  of                                          \n  tangible                                    \n  common                                      \n  equity:(\u2026                                   \n  Total                                       \n  sharehol\u2026    $      63,681    $     60,537  \n  equity                                      \n  Less:                                       \n  Preferred            6,673           6,673  \n  stock                                       \n  Noncontr\u2026              155              23  \n  interests                                   \n  Goodwill                                    \n  and                                         \n  intangib\u2026                                   \n  assets,             29,628          29,908  \n  net of                                      \n  deferred                                    \n  taxes                                       \n  Tangible                                    \n  common       $      27,225    $     23,933  \n  equity                                      \n  Common                                      \n  shares                                      \n  outstand\u2026        1,331,976       1,326,829  \n  at end of                                   \n  period                                      \n                                              \n(1) Tangible common equity and related\nmeasures are non-GAAP measures that exclude\nthe impact of intangible assets, net of\ndeferred taxes, and their related\namortization.

All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nTruist\u2019s compensation plans are designed to\nconsider teammate\u2019s adherence to and\nsuccessful implementation of Truist\u2019s risk\nvalues and associated policies and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation structure supports\nits core values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist applies an\naverage deposit beta of approximately 50% to\nits interest-bearing accounts when determining\nits interest rate sensitivity, which is\nconsistent with Truist\u2019s long-term\nexpectations. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 50 and 100 rate scenarios\nincorporate a floor of one basis point.\n\nRate sensitivity decreased compared to prior\nperiods, primarily driven by higher starting\nrates, higher deposit betas as rates increase\nand move into the highest beta tiers, and the\naddition of forward starting swaps.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry was very strong post-COVID-19, which\nresulted in growth in noninterest-bearing\ndemand deposits. However, with the significant\nincrease in rates in 2022 and the first half\nof 2023, noninterest-bearing deposits have\nbegun to shift to interest-bearing accounts.\nAdditional movement above what is currently\nprojected would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nmay increase interest-bearing funds to offset\nthe loss of these advantageous noninterest-\nbearing deposits. Alternatively, the Company\nmay reduce the size of its investment\nportfolio to offset the loss of noninterest-\nbearing demand deposits to limit the impact on\nthe balance sheet\u2019s asset sensitivity. The\nbehavior of these noninterest-bearing deposits\nis one of the most important assumptions used\nin determining the interest rate risk position\nof Truist.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at\n100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  18:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n                       Resul\u2026                 \n  Grad\u2026     Base       Assum\u2026                 \n  Chan\u2026    Scen\u2026            a                 \n  in          at       Decre\u2026                 \n  Rates     June           in                 \n  (bps)      30,       Nonin\u2026                 \n           2023\u2026       Demand                 \n                       Depos\u2026                 \n             $20          $40                 \n           Bill\u2026       Billi\u2026                 \n  Up       -1.00  %     -1.77  %    -2.54  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50    -0.61        -1.17       -1.74     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at June 30, 2023 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nmortgage banking operations, long-term debt,\nand other funding sources. Truist has utilized\nderivatives to facilitate transactions on\nbehalf of its clients and as part of\nassociated hedging activities. As of June 30,\n2023, Truist had derivative financial\ninstruments outstanding with notional amounts\ntotaling $509.8 billion. See \u201cNote 16.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d for\nadditional disclosures. In the second quarter\nof 2023, there was a $135 billion increase in\nnotional amounts on derivatives with central\nclearing parties as a result of the conversion\nfrom LIBOR to SOFR. This increased notional\namount is a short term impact of the\nconversion, with most of the increase maturing\nin the third and fourth quarter of 2023.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nThe remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR\nceased publication on June 30, 2023. To\nprepare for the transition to an alternative\nreference rate, management formed a cross-\nfunctional project team to address the LIBOR\ntransition. The project team performed an\nassessment to identify the risks related to\nthe transition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board on\nprogress. Training has been provided for\nimpacted teammates and will continue during\nthe second half of 2023. Truist provided\ntimely notices and information to impacted\nclients about the transition during the first\nhalf of 2023. Truist continues to manage the\nimpact of LIBOR-based contracts and other\nfinancial instruments, systems implications,\nhedging strategies, and related operational\nand market risks.\n\nContract fallback language for LIBOR contracts\nwas reviewed to identify required remediation\nto support the transition away from LIBOR.\nImpacted lines of business have remediated\nsubstantially all of these contracts to\ninclude standardized fallback language or\namended contracts to new reference rates ahead\nof cessation. Fallback language used to\nremediate loan agreements was generally\nconsistent with ARRC recommendations and\nincluded use of \u201chardwired fallback\u201d language,\nwhich will transition loans to a SOFR based\nrate after June 30, 2023. Similarly, fallback\nlanguage used to remediate LIBOR based\nderivatives was generally consistent with ISDA\npublications.\n\nLoan contracts, excluding mortgage loans, that\nmature post June 30, 2023 will transition\nprimarily to SOFR following the cessation\ndate. For contracts remaining without fallback\nlanguage, Truist leveraged the LIBOR Act and\ncorresponding safe harbor provision to\ntransition these loans to SOFR. Truist\u2019s\nadjustable-rate mortgage products had\nconsistent and adequate fallback language to\ntransition to SOFR, based on lender discretion\nand as supported by the LIBOR Act; therefore,\nthese contracts did not require remediation.\nFor many consumer lending portfolios, LIBOR\nwill transition to the SOFR rate specified in\nthe LIBOR Act and the rules promulgated\nthereunder by the FRB and will benefit from\nthe safe harbor provisions of the LIBOR Act.\n\nDerivatives that reference LIBOR will\ntransition to a SOFR-based replacement rate as\nset forth in the ISDA protocol addressing\nLIBOR fallbacks between the Company and its\ncounterparties which have adhered to the\nprotocol, through bilateral amendments between\nthe Company and each of its counterparties, or\nas established under the LIBOR Act and rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB.\n\nThe Company\u2019s preferred securities and the\nCompany\u2019s and Truist Bank\u2019s floating rate\nnotes that reference LIBOR will transition to\na SOFR based rate utilizing application of the\nLIBOR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder\nby the FRB. Truist recently announced that\nthese securities would move to a 3-month\nadjusted term SOFR in accordance with the\nLIBOR Act. See \u201cNote 12. Shareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d\nin Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\ninformation about preferred stock using LIBOR.\n\nAlternatives, such as SOFR, may react\ndifferently from LIBOR in times of economic\nstress. Truist expects SOFR to be the primary\npricing benchmark used across the industry and\nwill continue to offer additional SOFR based\nproducts. Additional alternative reference\nrates will be supported based on market\ndemand. For a further discussion of the\nvarious risks associated with the cessation of\nLIBOR and the transition to alternative\nreference rates, refer to the section titled\n\u201cItem1A. Risk Factors\u201d in the Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\n                                              \n  Market Risk from Trading Activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$56 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of June 30, 2023.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 67\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRO policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $84.8 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 112% for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At June 30, 2023\nand March 31, 2023, Truist\u2019s NSFR was 127%.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 21:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      52,737    $     49,250  \n  FHLB                23,219          20,770  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           77,875          85,401  \n  (after                                      \n  haircuts)                                   \n  Available                                   \n  secured            153,831         155,421  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             24,658          15,556  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     178,489    $    170,977  \n                                              \nAt June 30, 2023, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 3.2 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless. Truist additionally has the ability to\nincrease sources of funding by pledging\navailable investment securities to receive the\npar value of the collateral under the FRB Bank\nTerm Funding Program.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Parent Company had 47\nmonths and 37 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n25 months and 22 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings: Recent changes in\nthe Company\u2019s credit ratings and outlooks\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 On March 31,2023, S&P Global Ratings\naffirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\nand revised the outlook on those ratings to\n\u201cstable\u201d from \u201cpositive,\u201d citing heightened\nmarket volatility in the wake of recent bank\nfailures and, with inflation still elevated,\nhigher uncertainty, and greater downside risk\nin the economic outlook. The change in outlook\nwas part of a broader action by S&P Global\nRatings whereby the \u201cpositive\u201d outlook on\nthree other large U.S. banks was revised to\n\u201cstable.\u201d\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators.
