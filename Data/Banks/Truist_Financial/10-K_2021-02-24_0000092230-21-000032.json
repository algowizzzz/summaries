Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, regarding the financial\ncondition, results of operations, business\nplans and the future performance of Truist.\nWords such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\"\n\"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"forecasts,\"\n\"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\"\n\"should,\" \"would,\" \"could\" and other similar\nexpressions are intended to identify these\nforward-looking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead represent\nmanagement's expectations and assumptions\nregarding Truist's business, the economy and\nother future conditions. Such statements\ninvolve inherent uncertainties, risks and\nchanges in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. As such, Truist's actual results may\ndiffer materially from those contemplated by\nforward-looking statements. While there can be\nno assurance that any list of risks and\nuncertainties or risk factors is complete,\nimportant factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by forward-looking statements\ninclude the following, without limitation, as\nwell as the risks and uncertainties more fully\ndiscussed under Item 1A-Risk Factors:\n\n\u2022 risks and uncertainties relating to the\nMerger of heritage BB&T and heritage SunTrust,\nincluding the ability to successfully\nintegrate the companies or to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the Merger;\n\n\u2022 expenses relating to the Merger and\nintegration of heritage BB&T and heritage\nSunTrust;\n\n\u2022 deposit attrition, client loss or revenue\nloss following completed mergers or\nacquisitions may be greater than anticipated;\n\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the\nglobal economy, adversely impacted Truist's\nfinancial condition and results of operations,\nincluding through increased expenses, reduced\nfee income and net interest margin and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses,\nand continuation of current conditions could\nworsen these impacts and also adversely affect\nTruist's capital and liquidity position or\ncost of capital, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an\noutflow of deposits, and impair goodwill or\nother assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist is subject to credit risk by lending\nor committing to lend money and may have more\ncredit risk and higher credit losses to the\nextent that loans are concentrated by loan\ntype, industry segment, borrower type or\nlocation of the borrower or collateral;\n\n\u2022 changes in the interest rate environment,\nincluding the replacement of LIBOR as an\ninterest rate benchmark and potentially\nnegative interest rates, which could adversely\naffect Truist's revenue and expenses, the\nvalue of assets and obligations, and the\navailability and cost of capital, cash flows,\nand liquidity;\n\n\u2022 inability to access short-term funding or\nliquidity, loss of client deposits or changes\nin Truist's credit ratings, which could\nincrease the cost of funding or limit access\nto capital markets;\n\n\u2022 risk management oversight functions may not\nidentify or address risks adequately, and\nmanagement may not be able to effectively\nmanage credit risk;\n\n\u2022 risks resulting from the extensive use of\nmodels in Truist's business, which may impact\ndecisions made by management and regulators;\n\n\u2022 failure to execute on strategic or\noperational plans, including the ability to\nsuccessfully complete or integrate mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\n\u2022 increased competition, including from new or\nexisting competitors that could have greater\nfinancial resources or be subject to different\nregulatory standards, for products and\nservices offered by non-bank financial\ntechnology companies may reduce Truist's\nclient base, cause Truist to lower prices for\nits products and services in order to maintain\nmarket share or otherwise adversely impact\nTruist's businesses or results of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist's\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public opinion, which could damage\nTruist's reputation;\n\n\u2022 increased scrutiny regarding Truist's\nconsumer sales practices, training practices,\nincentive compensation design and governance;\n\n\u2022 regulatory matters, litigation or other\nlegal actions, which may result in, among\nother things, costs, fines, penalties,\nrestrictions on Truist's business activities,\nreputational harm, negative publicity or other\nadverse consequences;\n\n\u2022 evolving legislative, accounting and\nregulatory standards, including with respect\nto capital and liquidity requirements, and\nresults of regulatory examinations, may\nadversely affect Truist's financial condition\nand results of operations;\n\n\u2022 the monetary and fiscal policies of the\nfederal government and its agencies could have\na material adverse effect on profitability;\n\n\u2022 accounting policies and processes require\nmanagement to make estimates about matters\nthat are uncertain, including the potential\nwrite down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist's stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, and\ninstability in global geopolitical matters or\nvolatility in financial markets could result\nin, among other things, slower deposit or\nasset growth, a deterioration in credit\nquality or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance or other services;\n\n\u2022 risks related to originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 risks relating to Truist's role as a loan\nservicer, including an increase in the scope\nor costs of the services Truist is required to\nperform without any corresponding increase in\nservicing fees, or a breach of Truist\u2019s\nobligations as servicer;\n\n\u2022 Truist's success depends on hiring and\nretaining key personnel, and if these\nindividuals leave or change roles without\neffective replacements, Truist's operations\nand integration activities could be adversely\nimpacted, which could be exacerbated as Truist\ncontinues to integrate the management teams of\nheritage BB&T and heritage SunTrust;\n\n\u2022 fraud or misconduct by internal or external\nparties, which Truist may not be able to\nprevent, detect or mitigate;\n\n\u2022 security risks, including denial of service\nattacks, hacking, social engineering attacks\ntargeting Truist's teammates and clients,\nmalware intrusion, data corruption attempts,\nsystem breaches, cyber attacks and identity\ntheft, could result in the disclosure of\nconfidential information, adversely affect\nTruist's business or reputation or create\nsignificant legal or financial exposure; and\n\n\u2022 widespread outages of operational,\ncommunication or other systems, whether\ninternal or provided by third parties, natural\nor other disasters (including acts of\nterrorism and pandemics), and the effects of\nclimate change could have an adverse effect on\nTruist's financial condition and results of\noperations, or lead to material disruption of\nTruist's operations or the ability or\nwillingness of clients to access Truist's\nproducts and services.\n\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue\nreliance on these forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only as of the date they are made.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable\nlaw or regulation, Truist undertakes no\nobligation to revise or update any forward-\nlooking statements.\n\n4 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022

advantage that strengthens the\nCompany's ability to effectively provide\nfinancial products and services to businesses\nand individuals in its markets. In addition,\nmanagement has made significant investments in\nrecent years to develop its digital platform\nand believes that its mobile and online\napplications are highly competitive in meeting\nclients' expectations.\n                                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is intensely\ncompetitive and constantly evolving.\nLegislative, regulatory, economic, and\ntechnological changes as well as continued\nconsolidation within the industry could result\nin competition from new and existing market\nparticipants. Truist's subsidiaries compete\nactively with national, regional and local\nfinancial services providers, including banks,\nthrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers,\nfinance companies, financial technology\ncompanies and insurance companies. The ability\nof non-banking entities, including financial\ntechnology companies, to provide services\npreviously limited to commercial banks has\nincreased competition. Non-banking entities\nare not subject to the same regulatory\nframework as banks and BHCs, and therefore,\ncan often operate with greater flexibility and\nlower costs. In addition, the ability to\naccess and use technology is an increasingly\nsignificant competitive factor in the\nfinancial services industry. Having the right\ntechnology is a critically important component\nto client satisfaction because it affects the\nCompany\u2019s ability to deliver the products and\nservices that clients desire in a manner that\nthey find convenient and attractive.\nManagement believes that the Company is well\npositioned to compete and that its continued\nfocus on touch and technology will engender\ntrust among its current and future clients.\nFor additional information concerning markets,\nTruist's competitive position and business\nstrategies, see \"Market Area\" above and\n\"General Business Development\" in the\ndiscussion that follows.\n                                              \n  General Business Development                \n                                              \nTruist seeks to satisfy all of its clients'\nfinancial needs, enabling the Company to grow\nand diversify its sources of revenue and\nprofitability.

Truist\nwill assess future opportunities, based on\ngeography and market conditions and may, among\nother possibilities, pursue economically\nadvantageous acquisitions of insurance\nagencies, certain lending businesses and fee\nincome generating financial services\nbusinesses.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Considerations                   \n                                              \nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and the stability of\nthe U.S. financial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and creditors. In\naddition to banking laws and regulations,\nTruist is subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect the operations and\nmanagement of Truist and its ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes\nregulations and policies are continually under\nreview by Congress, state legislatures, and\nfederal and state regulatory agencies. In\naddition to laws and regulations, state and\nfederal bank regulatory agencies may issue\npolicy statements, interpretive letters and\nsimilar written guidance applicable to Truist\nand its subsidiaries. Any change in the\nstatutes, regulations or regulatory policies\napplicable to Truist, including changes in\ntheir interpretation or implementation, could\nhave a material effect on its business or\norganization.\n\nThe scope of the laws and regulations, and the\nintensity of the supervision to which Truist\nis subject have increased in recent years,\ninitially in response to the financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors\nsuch as technological and market changes.\nRegulatory enforcement and fines have also\nincreased across the banking and financial\nservices sector. Truist expects that its\nbusiness will remain subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws to which\nTruist is subject. The descriptions are\nqualified in their entirety by reference to\nthe particular statutory or regulatory\nprovisions summarized. They do not summarize\nall possible or proposed changes in current\nlaws or regulations and are not intended to be\na substitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  General                                     \n                                              \nAs a BHC, Truist is subject to regulation\nunder the BHCA and to regulation, examination\nand supervision by the FRB. Truist Bank, a\nNorth Carolina state-chartered commercial bank\nthat is not a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, is subject to regulation, supervision\nand examination by the NCCOB and the FDIC.\nTruist Bank and its affiliates are also\nsubject to examination by the CFPB for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws.\n\nTruist and certain of its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, including those that engage in\nderivatives transactions, securities\nunderwriting, market making, brokerage,\ninvestment advisory and insurance activities,\nare subject to other federal and state laws\nand regulations, as well as supervision and\nexamination by other federal and state\nregulatory agencies and other regulatory\nauthorities, including the SEC, CFTC, FINRA\nand the NYSE. Truist Bank is also subject to\nadditional state and federal laws, as well as\nvarious compliance regulations, that govern\nits activities, the investments it makes, and\nthe aggregate amount of loans that may be\ngranted to one borrower.\n\nExaminations by Truist's regulators consider\nnot only compliance with applicable laws,\nregulations and supervisory policies of the\nagency, but also capital levels, asset\nquality, risk management effectiveness, the\nability and performance of management and the\nboard of directors, the effectiveness of\ninternal controls, earnings, liquidity and\nvarious other factors. Following those\nexaminations, Truist and Truist Bank are\nassigned supervisory ratings. This supervisory\nframework, including the examination reports\nand supervisory ratings, which are considered\nconfidential supervisory information, could\nmaterially impact the conduct, growth and\nprofitability of Truist's operations.\n\nUnder the FRB's Large Financial Institution\nRating System, component ratings are assigned\nfor capital planning, liquidity risk\nmanagement, and governance and controls. To be\nconsidered \"well managed\" under this rating\nsystem, a firm must be rated \"broadly meets\nexpectations\" or \"conditionally meets\nexpectations\" for each of its three component\nratings.\n\nThe results of examinations by any of Truist's\nfederal bank regulators potentially can result\nin the imposition of significant limitations\non Truist's activities and growth. These\nregulatory agencies generally have broad\nenforcement authority and discretion to impose\nrestrictions and limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity, including the\nimposition of substantial monetary penalties\nand nonmonetary requirements against a\nregulated entity where the relevant agency\ndetermines that the operations of the\nregulated entity or any of its subsidiaries\nfail to comply with applicable law or\nregulations, are conducted in an unsafe or\nunsound manner, or represent an unfair or\ndeceptive act or practice.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 7\n                                              \n  FHC Regulation                              \n                                              \nTruist has elected to be treated as a FHC,\nwhich allows it to engage in a broader range\nof activities than would otherwise be\npermissible for a BHC, including activities\nthat are financial in nature or incidental\nthereto, such as securities underwriting or\nmerchant banking. In order to maintain its\nstatus as a FHC, Truist and its affiliated IDI\nmust be well-capitalized and well-managed and\nTruist Bank must have at least a satisfactory\nCRA rating. If the FRB determines that a FHC\nis not well-capitalized or well-managed, the\nFRB may impose corrective capital and\nmanagerial requirements on the FHC, and may\nplace limitations on its ability to conduct\ncertain business activities that FHCs are\ngenerally permitted to conduct and its ability\nto make certain acquisitions. If the failure\nto meet these standards persists, a FHC may be\nrequired to divest its IDI subsidiaries, or\ncease all activities other than those\nactivities that may be conducted by BHCs that\nare not FHCs. Furthermore, if an IDI\nsubsidiary of a FHC has not maintained a\nsatisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be\nable to commence any new financial activities\nor acquire a company that engages in such\nactivities, although the FHC would still be\nallowed to engage in activities closely\nrelated to banking and make investments in the\nordinary course of conducting banking\nactivities.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory\nTailoring Rules\n\nCertain U.S. BHCs, including Truist, are\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards. As\nsuch, Truist is subject to more stringent\nliquidity and capital requirements, leverage\nlimits, stress testing, resolution planning\nand risk management standards than those\napplicable to smaller institutions. Certain\nlarger banking organizations are subject to\nadditional enhanced prudential standards.\nTruist became subject to the FRB's single-\ncounterparty credit limit rule as of July 1,\n2020, and is subject to a limit of 25% of Tier\n1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures,\nincluding exposure resulting from, among other\ntransactions, extensions of credit, repurchase\nand reverse repurchase transactions,\ninvestments in securities and derivative\ntransactions, to any other unaffiliated\ncounterparty.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Truist is subject\nto the standards applicable to Category III\nbanking organizations, which generally include\nbank holding companies with greater than $250\nbillion, but less than $700 billion, in total\nconsolidated assets and less than $75 billion\nin certain risk-related exposures.\n                                              \n  Resolution Planning                         \n                                              \nAs a Category III banking organization, Truist\nwill be required to submit a resolution plan\nevery three years, with the first resolution\nplan under the new rule to be submitted by\nSeptember 29, 2021. Later resolution plans\nunder this rule will alternate between full\nresolution plans and targeted resolution\nplans. The FRB and the FDIC must review and\nevaluate Truist's resolution plan. The FRB and\nFDIC are authorized to impose restrictions on\ngrowth and activities or operations if the\nagencies determine that a resolution plan is\nnot credible or would not facilitate a rapid\nand orderly resolution of the company under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and could require\nthe banking organization to divest assets or\ntake other actions if it did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed.\n\nIn addition, Truist Bank is required by an\nFDIC regulation to file a separate bank level\nresolution plan. In April 2019, the FDIC\nissued an advanced notice of proposed\nrulemaking that would modify the content and\nfrequency of resolution planning requirements\nfor systemically important IDIs. While this\nproposal did not include specific details\nregarding the content or frequency of future\nbank level resolution planning requirements,\nthe FDIC indicated that the revised approach\nwould establish tiered resolution planning\nrequirements based on the size, complexity and\nother factors of applicable IDIs. On January\n19, 2021 the FDIC lifted a moratorium from\nNovember 2018 that delayed the next round of\nsubmissions of resolution plans for IDIs until\nthis rulemaking process has been completed.\nThe FDIC has indicated that firms will not be\nrequired to submit a resolution plan without\nat least 12 months advance notice. As Truist\nBank has not received any written notice\nregarding its next resolution plan submission\nit does not currently have an anticipated\nsubmission date for a resolution plan.\n                                              \n  Capital Requirements                        \n                                              \nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to certain\nrisk-based capital and leverage ratio\nrequirements established by the FRB, for\nTruist, and by the FDIC, for Truist Bank.\nThese requirements are based on the capital\nframework developed by the BCBS for\nstrengthening the regulation, supervision and\nrisk management of banks under Basel III\nrules, as well as certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. These quantitative\ncalculations are minimums, and the FRB and\nFDIC may determine that a banking\norganization, based on its size, complexity,\nor risk profile, must maintain a higher level\nof capital in order to operate in a safe and\nsound manner. Failure to be well capitalized\nor to meet minimum capital requirements could\nresult in certain mandatory and possible\nadditional discretionary actions by regulators\nthat, if undertaken, could have an adverse\nmaterial effect on Truist's operations or\nfinancial condition. Failure to be well\ncapitalized or to meet minimum capital\nrequirements could also result in restrictions\non Truist's or Truist Bank's ability to pay\ndividends or otherwise distribute capital or\nto receive regulatory approval of\napplications.\n\n8 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn October 2019, the federal banking\nregulators adopted rules that revised the\ncriteria for determining the applicability of\nregulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nfor large United States banking organizations,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, and that\ntailored the application of the FRB's enhanced\nprudential standards to large banking\norganizations. Under these rules, Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the standards\napplicable to \"Category III\" banking\norganizations.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, Truist's\nand Truist Bank's assets, exposures, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items are subject to\nrisk weights used to determine the\ninstitutions' risk-weighted assets. These\nrisk-weighted assets are used to calculate the\nfollowing minimum capital ratios for Truist\nand Truist Bank:\n\n\u2022 CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\nCET1 capital primarily includes common\nshareholders' equity subject to certain\nregulatory adjustments and deductions,\nincluding with respect to goodwill, intangible\nassets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n\n\u2022 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised\nof CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock and\ncertain qualifying capital instruments.\n\n\u2022 Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of total capital, including CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital,\nto risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital\nprimarily includes qualifying subordinated\ndebt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also\nincludes, among other things, certain trust\npreferred securities.\n\nIn March 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule\nthat integrates its annual capital planning\nand stress testing requirements with existing\nregulatory capital requirements. For risk-\nbased capital requirements for certain large\nBHCs, including Truist, the SCB replaced the\ncapital conservation buffer, which was\nrequired in order to avoid limitations on\ncapital distributions, including dividends and\nrepurchases of any Tier 1 capital instrument,\nsuch as common and qualifying preferred stock,\nand certain discretionary incentive\ncompensation payments. The capital\nconservation buffer was 2.5% through September\n30, 2020. Beginning in the 2020 CCAR cycle,\nthe FRB will notify Truist of its SCB\nrequirements, which is equal to the greater of\n(i) the difference between its starting and\nminimum projected CET1 capital ratios under\nthe severely adverse scenario in the\nsupervisory stress test, plus the sum of the\ndollar amount of Truist's planned common stock\ndividends for each of the fourth through\nseventh quarters of the planning horizon as a\npercentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii)\n2.5%. The FRB assigned Truist an SCB of 2.7%,\nwhich is effective from October 1, 2020\nthrough September 30, 2021. Although the final\nrule continues to require that the firm\ndescribe its planned capital distributions in\nits CCAR capital plan, Truist is no longer\nrequired to seek prior approval if it makes\ncapital distributions in excess of those\nincluded in its CCAR capital plan. Instead,\nTruist is subject to automatic distribution\nlimitations if its capital ratios fall below\nits buffer requirements, which include the\nSCB.\n\nFor certain large banking organizations, the\nSCB could be supplemented by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently\nset at zero. An FRB policy statement\nestablishes the framework and factors the FRB\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the countercyclical capital buffer. Covered\nbanking organizations would generally have 12\nmonths after the announcement of any increase\nin the countercyclical capital buffer to meet\nthe increased buffer requirement, unless the\nFRB determines to establish an earlier\neffective date. If the full countercyclical\nbuffer amount is implemented, Truist would be\nrequired to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of\nat least 9.7%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at\nleast 11.2%, and a Total capital ratio of at\nleast 13.2%, and Truist Bank would be required\nto maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least\n9.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 11%,\nand a Total capital ratio of at least 13%, to\navoid limitations on capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary incentive compensation\npayments.\n\nCertain large banking organizations with\ntrading assets and liabilities above certain\nthresholds, including Truist, are subject to\nthe Market Risk Rule and must adjust their\nrisk-based capital ratios to reflect the\nmarket risk of their trading activities. Refer\nto the \"Market Risk\" section of the MD&A for\nadditional disclosures related to market risk\nmanagement.\n\nIn addition, Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly\naverage assets, net of goodwill, certain other\nintangible assets, and certain other\ndeductions. Category III banking organizations\nare also subject to a minimum 3.0%\nsupplementary leverage ratio. The\nsupplementary leverage ratio is calculated by\ndividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage\nexposure, which takes into account on-balance\nsheet assets as well as certain off-balance\nsheet items, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure of derivative\ncontracts.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB\nadopted an interim final rule that temporarily\nchanges the supplementary leverage ratio to\nexclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation\nof a firm's leverage exposure. The interim\nfinal rule applies to BHCs. The interim final\nrule became effective April 1, 2020 and will\nremain in effect through March 31, 2021. While\na similar rule providing relief to IDIs was\nissued, Truist Bank has elected not to take\nadvantage of this provision for Truist Bank.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nThe total minimum regulatory capital ratios\nand well-capitalized minimum ratios applicable\nto Category III banking organizations are\nreflected in the table below. The FRB has not\nyet revised the well-capitalized standard for\nBHCs to reflect the higher capital\nrequirements imposed under the Basel III\nRules. For purposes of certain FRB rules,\nincluding determining whether a BHC meets the\nrequirements to be a FHC, BHCs, such as\nTruist, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based\nCapital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total\nRisk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater.\nThe FRB may require BHCs, including Truist, to\nmaintain capital ratios substantially in\nexcess of mandated minimum levels, depending\nupon general economic conditions and a BHC's\nparticular condition, risk profile, and growth\nplans.\n\nThe following table presents the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios, well-capitalized\nminimums, and minimum ratio plus the SCB or\ncapital conservation buffer, as applicable:\n                                              \n  Tab\u2026                                        \n  3:                                          \n  Cap\u2026                                        \n  Req\u2026                                        \n  Und\u2026                                        \n  Bas\u2026                                        \n  III                                         \n  Rul\u2026                                        \n                                   Mini\u2026      \n                       Well        Capi\u2026      \n          Mini\u2026       Capi\u2026         Plus      \n          Capi\u2026         (1)        Appl\u2026      \n                                   Buff\u2026      \n                                     (2)      \n  CET1                                        \n  ris\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026      4.5  %           NA      7.2  %   \n  Tru\u2026      4.5         6.5  %       7.0      \n  Bank                                        \n  Tier                                        \n  1                                           \n  ris\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026      6.0         6.0          8.7      \n  Tru\u2026      6.0         8.0          8.5      \n  Bank                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  ris\u2026                                        \n  cap\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026      8.0        10.0         10.7      \n  Tru\u2026      8.0        10.0         10.5      \n  Bank                                        \n  Lev\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026      4.0              NA           NA  \n  Tru\u2026      4.0         5.0               NA  \n  Bank                                        \n  Sup\u2026                                        \n  lev\u2026                                        \n  rat\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026      3.0              NA           NA  \n  Tru\u2026      3.0              NA           NA  \n  Bank                                        \n                                              \n(1) Reflects the well-capitalized standard\napplicable to Truist under FRB regulations and\nthe well-capitalized standard applicable to\nTruist Bank.\n\n(2) Reflects a SCB of 270 basis points for\nTruist and a capital conservation buffer of\n250 basis points for Truist Bank.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a\nfinal rule that permits banking organizations\nthat implement CECL before the end of 2020 to\nelect to follow the three-year transition\navailable under the prior rule or a new five-\nyear transition to phase in the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital. Under the five-\nyear transition, the banking organization\nwould defer for two years 100% of the day-one\neffect of adopting CECL and 25% of the\ncumulative increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses since adoption of CECL.\nFollowing the first two years, the electing\norganization will phase out the aggregate\ncapital effects over the next three years\nconsistent with the transition in the original\nthree-year transition rule. Truist has elected\nto use the five-year transition to phase in\nthe impacts of CECL on regulatory capital.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final\nrule altering the definition of eligible\nretained income. Under the final rule,\neligible retained income is the greater of a\nfirm's (i) net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, net of any distributions\nand associated tax effects not already\nreflected in net income, and (ii) average net\nincome over the preceding four quarters. This\ndefinition applies with respect to all of\nTruist's capital requirements.\n                                              \n  Capital Planning and Stress Testing         \n  Requirements                                \n                                              \nIn addition to the regulatory capital\nrequirements, under the FRB's CCAR process,\nTruist must submit an annual capital plan to\nthe FRB that reflects its projected financial\nperformance under hypothetical macro-economic\nscenarios, including a supervisory severely\nadverse scenario provided by the FRB.\n\nThe FRB's CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank\nAct stress testing framework also require BHCs\nsubject to Category III standards, such as\nTruist, to conduct company-run stress tests\nand subject them to supervisory stress tests\nconducted by the FRB. The company-run stress\ntests employ stress scenarios provided by the\nFRB and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital\nactions, which are intended to normalize\ncapital distribution assumptions across large\nU.S. BHCs. In addition, Truist is required to\nconduct annual stress tests using internally-\ndeveloped scenarios intended to stress the\nunique risk profile of the institution. The\nFRB also conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act\nsupervisory stress tests employing internal\nsupervisory models on the supervisory stress\nscenarios. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to supervisory\nstress testing on an annual basis and company-\nrun stress testing on a biennial basis.\n\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nStarting in the third quarter of 2020,\nfollowing the release of its annual stress\ntesting and due to the ongoing economic\nuncertainty resulting from the COVID-19\npandemic, the FRB required certain large\nbanking organizations, including Truist, to\nsuspend share repurchases, cap common\ndividends per share to the amount paid in the\nsecond quarter, and further limit dividends\naccording to a formula based on recent income.\nThe FRB also required all large banks to\nresubmit and update their capital plans based\non instructions and scenarios provided by the\nFRB. In December 2020, following a second\nround of stress testing based on the required\ncapital plan resubmissions, the FRB modified\nthese restrictions for the first quarter of\n2021 to permit share repurchases and dividends\naccording to a formula based on the average of\nthe firm's net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters. The FRB has not yet\nannounced whether they intend to return to the\nSCB framework for purposes of capital\ndistributions beginning in second quarter of\n2021.\n\nTruist is required to submit its next capital\nplan and the results of its own stress tests\nto the FRB by April 5, 2021. The FRB is\nrequired to announce the results of its\nsupervisory stress tests by June 30, 2021.\n\nIn addition to the CCAR stress testing for\nTruist, Truist Bank conducts annual company-\nrun stress tests.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Requirements                      \n                                              \nCertain BHCs and their bank subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, are subject\nto a minimum LCR. The LCR is designed to\nensure that BHCs have sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets to survive a significant\nliquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar\ndays.\n\nTruist also is subject to FRB rules that\nrequire certain large BHCs to conduct internal\nliquidity stress tests over a range of time\nhorizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid\nassets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC's 30-day liquidity\nstress test, and maintain a contingency\nfunding plan that meets certain requirements.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist will be subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which is\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. The NSFR,\ncalculated as the ratio of available stable\nfunding to required stable funding, must\nexceed 1.0x. Available stable funding\nrepresents a weighted measure of a company's\nfunding sources over a one-year time horizon,\ncalculated by applying standardized weightings\nto the company's equity and liabilities based\non their expected stability. Required Stable\nFunding is calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to assets, derivatives exposures\nand certain other items based on their\nliquidity characteristics. As a Category III\nbanking organization, Truist and Truist Bank\nare subject to an NSFR requirement equal to\n85% of the full requirement.\n                                              \n  Payment of Dividends                        \n                                              \nThe Parent Company is a legal entity separate\nand distinct from its subsidiaries, and it\ndepends in part upon dividends received from\nits direct and indirect subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist Bank, to fund its activities,\nincluding its ability to make capital\ndistributions, such as paying dividends or\nrepurchasing shares. Under federal law, there\nare various limitations on the extent to which\nTruist Bank can declare and pay dividends to\nthe Parent Company, including those related to\nregulatory capital requirements, general\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices, and federal banking law\nrequirements concerning the payment of\ndividends out of net profits, surplus, and\navailable earnings. Certain contractual\nrestrictions also may limit the ability of\nTruist Bank to pay dividends to the Parent\nCompany. No assurances can be given that\nTruist Bank will, in any circumstances, pay\ndividends to the Parent Company.\n\nThe Parent Company's ability to declare and\npay dividends is similarly limited by federal\nbanking law and FRB regulations and policy.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from\nmaking capital distributions if they would be\ndeemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice.\nThe FRB has indicated generally that it may be\nan unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay\ndividends unless a BHC's net income is\nsufficient to fund the dividends and the\nexpected rate of earnings retention is\nconsistent with the organization's capital\nneeds, asset quality and overall financial\ncondition. In addition, the Parent Company's\nability to make capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends and repurchasing\ncapital securities, is subject to the FRB's\nautomatic restrictions on capital\ndistributions under the FRB's capital rules.\nTruist's risk-based capital and leverage ratio\nrequirements are discussed below in the \"U.S.\nBasel III Capital Rules\" section.\n\nNorth Carolina law provides that, as long as a\nbank does not make distributions that reduce\nits capital below its applicable required\ncapital, the board of directors of a bank\nchartered under the laws of North Carolina may\ndeclare such distributions as the directors\ndeem proper.\n\nFor additional information regarding\nlimitations on dividends resulting from the\n2020 CCAR process, refer to \"Capital Planning\nand Stress Testing Requirements\" above.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\n                                              \n  Prompt Corrective Action                    \n                                              \nThe federal banking agencies are required to\ntake \"prompt corrective action\" with respect\nto financial institutions that do not meet\nminimum capital requirements. The law\nestablishes five categories for this purpose:\n\"well-capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\"\n\"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly\nundercapitalized\" and \"critically\nundercapitalized.\" To be considered \"well-\ncapitalized,\" an IDI must maintain minimum\ncapital ratios and must not be subject to any\norder or written directive to meet and\nmaintain a specific capital level for any\ncapital measure. An institution that fails to\nremain well-capitalized becomes subject to a\nseries of restrictions that increase in\nseverity as its capital condition weakens.\nSuch restrictions may include a prohibition on\ncapital distributions, restrictions on asset\ngrowth or restrictions on the ability to\nreceive regulatory approval of applications.\nThe regulations apply only to banks and not to\nBHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take\nappropriate action at the holding company\nlevel, based on the undercapitalized status of\nthe holding company's subsidiary banking\ninstitutions. In certain instances relating to\nan undercapitalized banking institution, the\nBHC would be required to guarantee the\nperformance of the undercapitalized\nsubsidiary's capital restoration plan and\ncould be liable for civil money damages for\nfailure to fulfill those guarantee\ncommitments.\n\nIn addition, failure to meet capital\nrequirements may cause an institution to be\ndirected to raise additional capital. Federal\nlaw further mandates that the agencies adopt\nsafety and soundness standards generally\nrelating to operations and management, asset\nquality and executive compensation, and\nauthorizes administrative action against an\ninstitution that fails to meet such standards.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines may subject\na banking organization to a variety of other\nenforcement remedies, including additional\nsubstantial restrictions on its operations and\nactivities, termination of deposit insurance\nby the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver.\n                                              \n  Transactions with Affiliates                \n                                              \nThere are various legal restrictions on the\nextent to which Truist and its non-bank\nsubsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in\ncertain types of transactions with Truist\nBank. Under the Federal Reserve Act and FRB\nregulations, Truist Bank and its subsidiaries\nare subject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit, purchases of\nassets, and certain other transactions\ninvolving its non-bank affiliates. In\naddition, transactions between Truist Bank and\nits non-bank affiliates are required to be on\narm's length terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                              \n  Acquisitions                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to numerous laws that may\nrequire regulatory approval for acquisitions.\nFor example, under the BHCA, a BHC may not\ndirectly or indirectly acquire ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares\nor substantially all of the assets of any BHC\nor bank or merge or consolidate with another\nBHC without the prior approval of the FRB. The\nBHCA and other federal laws enumerate the\nfactors the FRB must consider when reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC. These factors include the\ncompetitive effects of the proposal in the\nrelevant geographic markets; the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; the effect of the transaction on\nthe financial stability of the United States;\nthe organizations' compliance with anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved; and the records of performance under\nthe CRA of the IDIs involved in the\ntransaction.\n\nFederal law authorizes interstate acquisitions\nof banks and BHCs without geographic\nlimitation, and a bank headquartered in one\nstate is authorized to merge with a bank\nheadquartered in another state, subject to\nmarket share limitations, regulatory approvals\nand any state requirement that the target bank\nshall have been in existence and operating for\na minimum period of time. The market share\nlimitations impose conditions that the\nacquiring BHC, after and as a result of the\nacquisition, control no more than 10% of the\ntotal amount of deposits of IDIs in the U.S.\nand no more than 30%, or such lesser or\ngreater percentage established by state law,\nof such deposits in applicable states. FRB\nrules also prohibit a FHC from combining with\nanother company if the ratio of the resulting\ncompany's liabilities exceeds 10% of the\naggregate consolidated liabilities of all\nfinancial companies.\n\nAfter a bank has established branches in a\nstate through an interstate merger\ntransaction, the bank may establish and\nacquire additional branches at any location in\nthe state where a bank headquartered in that\nstate could have established or acquired\nbranches under applicable federal or state\nlaw. These regulatory considerations are\napplicable to privately negotiated acquisition\ntransactions.\n                                              \n  Other Safety and Soundness Regulations      \n                                              \nThe FRB has supervisory and enforcement powers\nover BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit activities\nthat represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nconstitute violations of law, rule,\nregulation, administrative order or written\nagreement with a federal regulator. These\npowers may be exercised through the issuance\nof confidential supervisory actions, cease and\ndesist orders, civil monetary penalties or\nother actions.\n\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThere also are a number of obligations and\nrestrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI\nsubsidiaries by federal law and regulatory\npolicy that are designed to reduce potential\nloss exposure to depositors and the DIF in the\nevent the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of\nbecoming insolvent. For example, the FRB\nrequires a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and\nto commit financial resources to support such\ninstitutions in circumstances where it might\nnot do so otherwise.\n\nBanking regulators also have broad supervisory\nand enforcement powers over Truist Bank,\nincluding the power to impose confidential\nsupervisory actions, fines and other civil and\ncriminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver\nin order to conserve the assets of Truist Bank\nfor the benefit of depositors and other\ncreditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to\ntake possession of a North Carolina state bank\nin certain circumstances, including when it\nappears that such bank has violated its\ncharter or any applicable laws, is conducting\nits business in an unauthorized or unsafe\nmanner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition\nto transact its business or has an impairment\nof its capital stock.\n                                              \n  DIF Assessments                             \n                                              \nTruist Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC\nup to the applicable limits, which is\ncurrently $250,000 per account ownership type.\nThe FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium\nassessment system that determines assessment\nrates for an IDI based on an assessment rate\ncalculator, which is based on a number of\nelements to measure the risk each IDI poses to\nthe DIF. The assessment rate is applied to\ntotal average assets less tangible equity, as\ndefined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The\nassessment rate schedule can change from time\nto time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject\nto certain limits. Under the current system,\npremiums are assessed quarterly.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio\nfell to 1.30% due to significant growth in\nindustry deposits during the first half of\n2020. The FDIC, as required under the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act, established a plan on\nSeptember 15, 2020, to restore the DIF reserve\nratio to meet or exceed 1.35% within eight\nyears. The FDIC's restoration plan projects\nthe reserve ratio to exceed 1.35% without\nincreasing the deposit insurance assessment\nrate, subject to ongoing monitoring over the\nnext eight years. The FDIC could increase the\ndeposit insurance assessments for certain\ninsured depository institutions, including\nTruist Bank, if the DIF reserve ratio is not\nrestored as projected.\n                                              \n  Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations    \n                                              \nIn connection with its lending and leasing\nactivities, Truist Bank is subject to a number\nof federal and state laws designed to protect\nborrowers and promote lending to various\nsectors of the economy and population. The\nCFPB examines Truist and Truist Bank for\ncompliance with a broad range of federal\nconsumer financial laws and regulations,\nincluding the laws and regulations that relate\nto deposit products, credit card, mortgage,\nautomobile, student and other consumer loans,\nand other consumer financial products and\nservices offered. The federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws that are subject to\nthe CFPB's supervision and enforcement powers\ninclude, among others, the Truth in Lending\nAct, Truth in Savings Act, HMDA, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. The CFPB\nalso has authority to take enforcement actions\nto prevent and remedy acts and practices\nrelating to consumer financial products and\nservices that it deems to be unfair, deceptive\nor abusive, and to impose new disclosure\nrequirements for any consumer financial\nproduct or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by Truist or\nTruist Bank. The regulations could reduce the\nfees that Truist receives, alter the way\nTruist provides its products and services, or\nexpose Truist to greater risk of private\nlitigation or regulatory enforcement action.\n\nDuring November 2019, SunTrust Bank entered\ninto a consent order with the FRB, relating to\ncertain identified legacy compliance issues,\nand providing certain remediation actions and\nthe verification of such actions regarding the\nidentified issues. Truist Bank, as successor\nto SunTrust Bank, has committed to comply with\nthe obligations in the order. Compliance with\nthe order's obligations is currently being\nassessed by the FDIC.\n                                              \n  Patriot Act                                 \n                                              \nThe Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the\nability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and\nintelligence communities to cooperate in the\nprevention, detection and prosecution of\ninternational money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism. The Patriot Act\ncontains anti-money laundering measures\naffecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain\nother financial institutions. The Patriot Act\nincludes the International Money Laundering\nAbatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of\n2001, which requires such financial\ninstitutions to implement policies and\nprocedures to combat money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism and grants the\nSecretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority\nto establish regulations and to impose\nrequirements and restrictions on financial\ninstitutions' operations. The Patriot Act\nimposes substantial obligations on financial\ninstitutions to maintain appropriate policies,\nprocedures and processes to detect, prevent\nand report money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing and other financial crimes. Failure\nto comply with these regulations may result in\nfines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory\nsanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions\non business. In addition, the Patriot Act\nrequires the federal bank regulatory agencies\nto consider the effectiveness of a financial\ninstitution's anti-money laundering activities\nwhen reviewing bank mergers and BHC\nacquisitions.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 13\n                                              \n  BSA/AML and Sanctions                       \n                                              \nTruist is subject to a number of anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations as a result of\nbeing a financial company headquartered in the\nUnited States. AML requirements are primarily\nderived from the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended\nby the Patriot Act. These laws and regulations\nare designed to prevent the financial system\nfrom being used by criminals to hide illicit\nproceeds and to impede terrorists' ability to\naccess and move funds used in support of\nterrorist activities. Among other things,\nBSA/AML laws and regulations require financial\ninstitutions to establish AML programs that\nmeet certain standards, including, in some\ninstances, expanded reporting, particularly in\nthe area of suspicious transactions, and\nenhanced information gathering and\nrecordkeeping requirements. Financial\ninstitutions are also required to verify their\ncustomers' identity, verify the identity of\nbeneficial owners of legal entity customers,\nconduct customer due diligence, report on\nsuspicious activity, file reports of\ntransactions in currency, and conduct enhanced\ndue diligence on certain accounts. Failure to\ncomply with applicable laws and regulations or\nmaintain adequate AML related controls can\nlead to significant monetary penalties and\nreputational damage.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury's OFAC rules prohibit U.S.\npersons from engaging in financial\ntransactions with certain individuals,\nentities, or countries, identified as\n\"Specially Designated Nationals,\" such as\nterrorists and narcotics traffickers. These\nrules require the blocking of assets held by,\nand prohibit transfers of property to such\nindividuals, entities or countries. Blocked\nassets, such as property or bank deposits,\ncannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or\ntransferred in any manner without a license\nfrom OFAC. Truist maintains an OFAC program\ndesigned to ensure compliance with OFAC\nrequirements. Failure to comply with such\nrequirements could subject Truist to serious\nlegal and reputational consequences, including\ncriminal penalties.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, the U.S. Congress enacted\nthe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which\nseeks to modernize the anti-money laundering\nand countering the financing of terrorism\nframework in the United States, by enhancing\nanalytical capabilities of and improving\ncoordination among law enforcement agencies.\nThe act also seeks to streamline the currency\ntransaction report and suspicious activity\nreport requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.\nThe act directs the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S.\nTreasury, to establish a national beneficial\nownership reporting framework that requires\nnon-exempt U.S. companies and companies doing\nbusiness in the U.S. to disclose information\nabout their beneficial ownership at the time\nof incorporation and subsequently when changes\noccur. In addition to being available to law\nenforcement, information maintained in the\ndatabase would be available to financial\ninstitutions in support of their customer due\ndiligence requirements. The act will be\nimplemented through various regulations,\nreports, and assessments by the various\nfinancial regulators, which have not yet been\nproposed. The impact of such regulations on\nTruist will depend on the final requirements.\n                                              \n  Privacy and Cyber Security                  \n                                              \nThe FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory\nagencies have adopted guidelines for\nsafeguarding confidential, personal customer\ninformation. These guidelines require each\nfinancial institution, under the supervision\nand ongoing oversight of its board of\ndirectors or an appropriate committee thereof,\nto create, implement and maintain a\ncomprehensive written information security\nprogram designed to ensure the security and\nconfidentiality of customer information,\nprotect against any anticipated threats or\nhazards to the security or integrity of such\ninformation and protect against unauthorized\naccess to or use of such information that\ncould result in substantial harm or\ninconvenience to any customer. In addition,\nvarious U.S. regulators, including the FRB and\nthe SEC, have increased their focus on cyber\nsecurity through guidance, examinations and\nregulations.\n\nThe GLBA requires financial institutions to\nimplement policies and procedures regarding\nthe disclosure of nonpublic personal\ninformation about consumers to non-affiliated\nthird parties. In general, the statute\nrequires explanations to consumers on policies\nand procedures regarding the disclosure of\nsuch nonpublic personal information and,\nexcept as otherwise required by law, prohibits\ndisclosing such information except as provided\nin the banking subsidiary's policies and\nprocedures.\n\nStates are also increasingly proposing or\nenacting legislation that relates to data\nprivacy and data protection such as the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act which went\ninto effect on January 1, 2020. Truist has\nundertaken significant efforts to comply with\nthese laws and continues to assess their\nrequirements and applicability to Truist.\nThese laws and proposed legislation are still\nsubject to revision or formal guidance and\nthey may be interpreted or applied in a manner\ninconsistent with the Company's understanding.\nCalifornia voters also recently passed the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, which will take\neffect on January 1, 2023, and significantly\nmodifies the California Consumer Privacy Act,\nincluding by imposing additional obligations\non covered companies and expanding California\nconsumers' rights with respect to certain\nsensitive personal information, potentially\nresulting in further uncertainty and requiring\nTruist to incur additional costs and expenses\nin an effort to comply.\n\nIn addition, the promulgation in 2017 of the\nNew York Department of Financial Services\nCybersecurity Regulation and the National\nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners\nInsurance Data Security Model Law are driving\nsignificant cybersecurity compliance\nactivities for Truist. Both of these\nregulations include phased compliance periods\nas well as attestation of compliance by\nTruist.\n\n14 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nLike other lenders, Truist Bank uses credit\nbureau data in its underwriting activities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates\nreporting information to credit bureaus,\nprescreening individuals for credit offers,\nsharing of information between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate data for marketing purposes.\nSimilar state laws may impose additional\nrequirements on Truist Bank.\n\nIn addition, in December 2020, the FRB, OCC\nand FDIC issued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking that, among other things, would\nrequire a banking organization to notify its\nprimary federal regulators within 36 hours\nafter identifying a \"computer-security\nincident\" that the banking organization\nbelieves in good faith could materially\ndisrupt, degrade or impair its business or\noperations in a manner that would, among other\nthings, jeopardize the viability of its\noperations, result in customers being unable\nto access their deposit and other accounts,\nresult in a material loss of revenue, profit\nor franchise value, or pose a threat to the\nfinancial stability of the U.S.\n                                              \n  CRA                                         \n                                              \nThe CRA requires Truist Bank's primary federal\nbank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess\nthe bank's record in meeting the credit needs\nof the communities served by the bank,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods and persons. Institutions are\nassigned one of four ratings: \"Outstanding,\"\n\"Satisfactory,\" \"Needs to Improve\" or\n\"Substantial Noncompliance.\" This assessment\nis considered for any bank that applies to\nmerge or consolidate with or acquire the\nassets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or\nto open or relocate a branch office. The CRA\nrecord of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also\nis assessed by the FRB in connection with\nreviewing any proposed acquisition or merger\napplication.\n                                              \n  Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation      \n                                              \nThere are federal consumer protection laws\nrelated to automated overdraft payment\nprograms offered by financial institutions.\nThe CFPB prohibits financial institutions from\ncharging consumers fees for paying overdrafts\non automated teller machine and one-time debit\ncard transactions, unless a consumer consents,\nor opts in, to the overdraft service.\nFinancial institutions must also provide\nconsumers with a notice that explains the\nfinancial institution's overdraft services,\nincluding the associated fees and the\nconsumer's choices. In addition, FDIC-\nsupervised institutions must monitor overdraft\npayment programs for \"excessive or chronic\"\nclient use and undertake \"meaningful and\neffective\" follow-up action with clients that\noverdraw their accounts more than six times\nduring a rolling 12-month period. Financial\ninstitutions must also impose daily limits on\noverdraft charges, review and modify check-\nclearing procedures, prominently distinguish\naccount balances from available overdraft\ncoverage amounts and ensure board and\nmanagement oversight regarding overdraft\npayment programs.\n                                              \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nTruist is prohibited under the Volcker Rule\nfrom (i) engaging in proprietary trading\nactivities, and (ii) having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with covered\nprivate funds. The fundamental prohibitions of\nthe Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of\nany size, including Truist and its affiliates.\nThe Volcker Rule regulations contain\nexemptions or exclusions for market-making,\nhedging, underwriting, trading in U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations and also\npermit certain ownership interests in certain\ntypes of funds to be retained. They also\npermit the offering and sponsoring of funds\nunder certain conditions. The Volcker Rule\nregulations impose significant compliance\nobligations on banking entities. Truist has\nput in place the compliance programs required\nby the Volcker Rule and has either divested or\nreceived extensions for any holdings in\nilliquid funds.\n\nIn June 2020, the regulatory agencies charged\nwith implementing the Volcker Rule finalized\namendments to the Volcker Rule's restrictions\non ownership interests in and relationships\nwith covered funds. Among other things, these\namendments permit banking entities to have\nrelationships with and offer additional\nfinancial services to additional types of\nfunds and investment vehicles. These\nrequirements are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on Truist's consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations or\ncash flows.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Regime for Swaps                 \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive\nregulatory regime for the OTC swaps market,\naimed at increasing transparency and reducing\nsystemic risk in the derivatives markets,\nincluding requirements for central clearing,\nexchange trading, capital adequacy, margin,\nreporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank\nAct requires that certain swap dealers and\nsecurity-based swap dealers register with one\nor both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the\nnature of the swaps business. Truist Bank\nprovisionally registered with the CFTC as a\nswap dealer, subjecting Truist Bank to\nrequirements under the CFTC's regulatory\nregime, including trade reporting and record\nkeeping requirements, margin requirements,\nbusiness conduct requirements (including daily\nvaluations, disclosure of material risks\nassociated with swaps and disclosure of\nmaterial incentives and conflicts of\ninterest), and mandatory clearing and exchange\ntrading requirements for certain standardized\nswaps designated by the CFTC. Truist Bank\nexpects to register with the SEC as a\nsecurity-based swap dealer in 2021. Such\nregistration will subject Truist Bank's\nsecurity-based swaps business to requirements\nthat are similar to the CFTC rules applicable\nto swap dealers, including trade reporting,\nbusiness conduct standards, recordkeeping,\nmargin, and potentially mandatory clearing and\nexchange trading requirements.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 15\nTruist Bank's uncleared swaps and security-\nbased swaps are subject to variation margin\nand initial margin requirements. The variation\nmargin requirements are currently in effect\nand the initial margin requirements are\nphasing in over a period of six years and will\nbe fully phased-in on September 1, 2022,\ndepending on the level of derivatives activity\nof the swap dealer and the relevant\ncounterparty. Truist Bank's derivatives\nbusiness involving uncleared swaps is expected\nto become subject to initial margin\nrequirements established by the U.S.\nprudential regulators, which may subject\nTruist Bank to initial margin requirements\nthat exceed current market practice.\n                                              \n  Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser        \n  Regulation                                  \n                                              \nTruist's broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulation by the\nSEC. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory\norganization for Truist's registered broker-\ndealer and investment adviser subsidiaries.\nTruist's broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries also are subject to additional\nregulation by states or local jurisdictions.\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement\nfunctions that oversee broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers and can bring actions that\nresult in fines, restitution, a limitation on\npermitted activities, disqualification to\ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an\ninability to rely on certain favorable\nexemptions. Certain types of infractions and\nviolations also can affect Truist's ability to\nexpeditiously issue new securities into the\ncapital markets. In addition, certain changes\nin the activities of a broker-dealer require\napproval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into\naccount a variety of considerations in acting\nupon applications for such approval, including\ninternal controls, capital levels, management\nexperience and quality, prior enforcement and\ndisciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\n\nIn June 2019, the SEC finalized Regulation\nBest Interest, which imposes a new standard of\nconduct on SEC-registered broker-dealers when\nmaking recommendations to retail customers. In\naddition, the SEC finalized a new summary\ndisclosure form that broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers must provide to retail\ncustomers. Truist's broker-dealer and\ninvestment adviser subsidiaries were required\nto comply with these requirements, as\napplicable, as of June 2020.\n                                              \n  FDIC Recordkeeping Requirements             \n                                              \nTo facilitate prompt payment of FDIC-insured\ndeposits when large IDIs fail, FDIC rules\nrequire IDIs with two million or more deposit\naccounts to maintain complete and accurate\ndata on each depositor's ownership interest by\nright and capacity and to develop the\ncapability to calculate the insured and\nuninsured amounts for each deposit owner by\nownership right and capacity. Compliance with\nthe rule was originally required by April 1,\n2020. In July 2019, the FDIC amended the rules\nrelated to recordkeeping requirements and\ntimely deposit insurance determination to\nallow covered IDIs an optional one-year\nextension, which Truist elected, of the\noriginal compliance deadline to April 1, 2021.\n                                              \n  Other Regulatory Matters                    \n                                              \nTruist is subject to examinations by federal\nand state banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFTC, FINRA, NYSE, various taxing\nauthorities and various state insurance and\nsecurities regulators. Truist periodically\nreceives requests for information from\nregulatory authorities in various states,\nincluding state insurance commissions and\nstate attorneys general, securities regulators\nand other regulatory authorities, concerning\nTruist's business and accounting practices.\nSuch requests are considered incidental to the\nnormal conduct of business.\n                                              \n  Government Response to COVID-19             \n                                              \nCongress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and\nfederal financial regulatory agencies, as well\nas state legislatures and officials, have\ntaken actions to mitigate disruptions to\neconomic activity and financial stability\nresulting from COVID-19 and may continue to\nevolve such approaches and requirements in\nways that further impact the business of the\nCompany. The descriptions below summarize\ncertain significant government actions taken\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The\ndescriptions are qualified in their entirety\nby reference to the particular statutory or\nregulatory provisions or government programs\nsummarized.\n                                              \n  The CARES Act                               \n                                              \nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27,\n2020 and subsequently has been amended several\ntimes, including by the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2021. Among other\nprovisions the CARES Act includes funding for\nthe Small Business Administration to expand\nlending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP\nrequirements to allow COVID-19-related loan\nmodifications to not be categorized as\ntroubled debt restructurings and a range of\nincentives to encourage deferment, forbearance\nor modification of loans. One of the key CARES\nAct programs is the PPP. PPP loans are\navailable to a broader range of entities than\nordinary Small Business Administration loans,\nrequire deferral of principal and interest\nrepayment, and the loan may be forgiven. The\nPPP was recently expanded to permit a second\nround of funding, including for certain\nborrowers who have already received a PPP\nloan, subject to certain conditions. On\nFebruary 22, 2021, changes were made to the\nPPP program to establish a 14-day exclusive\napplication period beginning on February 24,\n2021, for businesses and nonprofits with fewer\nthan 20 employees. This is intended to give\nlenders and community partners more time to\nwork with the smallest businesses, while also\nensuring that larger PPP-eligible businesses\nstill have time to apply and receive support\nprior to the program expiration on March 31,\n2021.\n\n16 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe CARES Act contains additional protections\nfor homeowners and renters of properties with\nfederally backed mortgages, including a 60-day\nmoratorium on the initiation of foreclosure\nproceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a\n120-day moratorium on initiating eviction\nproceedings effective March 27, 2020.\nBorrowers of federally backed mortgages have\nthe right under the CARES Act to request up to\n360 days of forbearance on their mortgage\npayments if they experience financial hardship\ndirectly or indirectly due to the coronavirus-\nrelated public health emergency. FNMA, FHLMC,\nFHA and VA have continued to extend their\nmoratorium on foreclosures and evictions for\nsingle-family federally backed mortgages well\ninto 2021.\n\nAlso pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S.\nTreasury has the authority to provide loans,\nguarantees and other investments in support of\neligible businesses, states and municipalities\naffected by the economic effects of COVID-19.\nSome of these funds have been used to support\nthe several FRB programs and facilities\ndescribed below or additional programs or\nfacilities that are established by the FRB\nunder its Section 13(3) authority and meeting\ncertain criteria.\n\nIn addition to authorizing several programs to\nprovide loans, guarantees and other\ninvestments in support of eligible\norganizations, states and municipalities\naffected by the economic effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act also includes\nseveral measures that temporarily adjust\nexisting laws or regulations. The CARES Act\nalso provides financial institutions with the\noption to suspend certain GAAP requirements\nfor coronavirus-related loan modifications\nthat would otherwise constitute troubled debt\nrestructurings and further requires the\nfederal banking agencies to defer to financial\ninstitutions' determinations in making such\nsuspensions. Refer to \"Note 1. Basis of\nPresentation\" for Truist's policy related to\nCOVID-19 loan modifications.\n                                              \n  FRB Actions                                 \n                                              \nThe FRB took a range of actions to support the\nflow of credit to households and businesses.\nFor example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB\nreduced the target range for the federal funds\nrate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would\nincrease its holdings of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and begin purchasing agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB\nalso encouraged depository institutions to\nborrow from the discount window and lowered\nthe primary credit rate for such borrowing by\n150 basis points and extended the term of such\nloans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have\nbeen reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020.\n\nIn addition, the FRB established a range of\nfacilities and programs to support the U.S.\neconomy and U.S. marketplace participants in\nresponse to economic disruptions associated\nwith COVID-19. Through these facilities and\nprograms, the FRB took steps to directly or\nindirectly purchase assets from, or make loans\nto, U.S. companies, financial institutions,\nmunicipalities and other market participants.\n\nFRB facilities and programs that remain active\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 a PPP Liquidity Facility to provide\nfinancing related to PPP loans made by banks;\n\n\u2022 a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide\nliquidity to primary dealers through a secured\nlending facility;\n\n\u2022 a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to\npurchase the commercial paper of certain U.S.\nissuers; and\n\n\u2022 a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility to purchase certain assets from, or\nmake loans to, financial institutions\nproviding financing to eligible money market\nmutual funds.\n\nFRB facilities and programs that expired as of\nDecember 31, 2020 included:\n\n\u2022 three Main Street Loan Facilities to\npurchase loan participations, under specified\nconditions, from banks lending to small and\nmedium sized U.S. businesses;\n\n\u2022 a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility\nto purchase corporate bonds directly from, or\nmake loans directly to, eligible participants;\n\n\u2022 a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility\nto purchase corporate bonds trading in\nsecondary markets, including from exchange-\ntraded funds, that were issued by eligible\nparticipants;\n\n\u2022 a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility\nto make loans secured by asset-backed\nsecurities; and\n\n\u2022 a Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase\nbonds directly from U.S. state, city and\ncounty issuers\n                                              \n  Human Capital                               \n                                              \nTruist believes it is crucial to attract and\nretain top talent who can further Truist's\npurpose, mission and values. To facilitate\ntalent attraction and retention, Truist aims\nto provide teammates a diverse, inclusive and\nsafe workplace that affords them opportunities\nto grow and develop in their careers.\n\nTruist's Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee provides input on talent management\nstrategy for Truist and oversees the design\nand administration of material incentive\ncompensation arrangements, as well as other\nhuman capital matters, including teammate\ndiversity and inclusion, teammate engagement,\nand well-being initiatives.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 17\nTruist's Enterprise Ethics Risk Office\npartners with a broad group of internal\nstakeholders to set standards for teammate\nconduct and facilitate the timely intake and\nrouting of teammate concerns for review.

If these individuals leave or\nchange their roles without effective\nreplacements, operations may suffer.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 21\n\u2022 The Company may not be able to hire or\nretain additional qualified personnel and\nrecruiting and compensation costs may increase\nas a result of changes in the marketplace,\nwhich may increase costs and adversely impact\nthe Company's ability to implement business\nstrategies.\n\n\u2022 The Company's framework for managing risks\nmay not be effective.\n\n\u2022 There are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in Truist's business, which may\nimpact decisions made by Management and\nregulators.\n\n\u2022 The Company is at risk of increased losses\nfrom fraud.\n\n\u2022 The Company's operational or security\nsystems or infrastructure or those of third\nparties, could fail or be breached, which\ncould disrupt the Company's business and\nadversely impact the Company's results of\noperations, liquidity and financial condition,\nas well as cause legal or reputational harm.\n\n\u2022 Natural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents could have a material adverse impact on\nthe Company\u2019s operations or the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results.\n\n\u2022 Truist may be impacted by the soundness of\nother financial institutions.\n\n\u2022 Truist depends on the accuracy and\ncompleteness of information about clients and\ncounterparties.\n\n\u2022 The Company's accounting policies and\nprocesses are critical to how it reports the\nCompany's financial condition and results of\noperations. They require management to make\nestimates about matters that are uncertain.\n\n\u2022 Depressed market values for the Company's\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company's goodwill.\n\n\u2022 Certain banking laws and certain provisions\nof the Company's articles of incorporation may\nhave an anti-takeover effect.\n                                              \n  Technology Risks                            \n                                              \n\u2022 The Company faces cybersecurity risks,\nincluding denial of service, hacking and\nsocial engineering attacks that could result\nin the disclosure of confidential information,\nadversely affect the Company's operations or\nreputation and create significant legal and\nfinancial exposure.\n\n\u2022 Truist will continually encounter\ntechnological change and must effectively\ndevelop and implement new technology.\n\nThe following discussion sets forth some of\nthe more important risk factors that could\nmaterially affect Truist's financial condition\nand operations. When a risk factor spans\nseveral risk categories, the risks have been\nlisted by their primary risk category. The\nrisks described are not all inclusive.\nAdditional risks that are not presently known\nor risks deemed immaterial may have a material\nadverse effect on Truist's financial\ncondition, results of operations, business and\nprospects.\n                                              \n  Merger-Related Risks                        \n                                              \nTruist may not be able to successfully\nintegrate the companies or to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the Merger.\n\nThe Company was formed by the Merger of BB&T\nand SunTrust on December 6, 2019. Truist\nanticipates further integration of systems,\noperations, and personnel of BB&T and SunTrust\nover the next couple of years.\n\nThe successful integration of BB&T's and\nSunTrust's operations will depend\nsubstantially on the Company's ability to\nsuccessfully consolidate operations,\nmanagement teams, corporate cultures, systems\nand procedures and to eliminate redundancies\nand costs. Truist may encounter difficulties\nduring integration, such as:\n\n\u2022 the loss of key teammates and clients;\n\n\u2022 the disruption of operations and businesses;\n\n\u2022 loan, deposit, and revenue attrition;\n\n\u2022 inconsistencies in standards, control\nprocedures and policies;\n\n\u2022 unexpected issues with planned branch and\nother facilities closures;\n\n\u2022 unexpected issues with costs, operations,\npersonnel, technology; and\n\n\u2022 problems with the assimilation of new\noperations, sites or personnel.\n\nIntegration activities have and will continue\nto divert resources from regular operations.\nIn addition, general market and economic\nconditions or governmental actions affecting\nthe financial industry may inhibit the\nCompany's successful integration of these\nentities.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nBB&T and SunTrust merged with the expectation\nthat the Merger would result in various\nsynergies, including benefits relating to\nenhanced revenues, a strengthened and expanded\nmarket position for the combined organization,\ntechnology efficiencies, cost savings and\noperating efficiencies. Achieving the\nanticipated benefits of the Merger is subject\nto a number of uncertainties, including\nwhether the Company integrates the\ninstitutions in an efficient and effective\nmanner, as well as general competitive factors\nin the marketplace. Failure to achieve or\ndelays in achieving these anticipated benefits\ncould result in a share price reduction as\nwell as increased costs, decreases in the\namount of expected revenues, and diversion of\nmanagement's time and energy and could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company's\nfinancial condition, results of operations,\nbusiness and prospects.\n\nTruist will continue to incur substantial\nexpenses related to the Merger and the\nintegration.\n\nThere are a large number of processes,\npolicies, procedures, operations, technologies\nand systems that must be integrated. In\naddition, the Merger may increase the\nCompany's compliance and legal risks,\nincluding increased litigation or regulatory\nactions such as fines or restrictions related\nto the business practices or operations of the\ncombined business.\n\nWhile the Company has assumed that a certain\nlevel of expenses would be incurred, there are\nmany factors beyond the Company's control that\ncould affect the total amount or the timing of\nthe integration expenses. Moreover, many of\nthe expenses that will be incurred are, by\ntheir nature, difficult to estimate\naccurately. These expenses could, particularly\nin the near term, exceed the expected savings\nfrom the elimination of duplicative expenses\nand the realization of economies of scale. The\namount and timing of future charges to\nearnings as a result of Merger or integration\nexpenses are uncertain.\n                                              \n  COVID-19 Risks                              \n                                              \nThe effects of COVID-19 have adversely\nimpacted, and will likely continue to\nadversely impact, the Company's financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted\nalmost all economic activity in the U.S.\nDespite the partial lifting of federal and\nstate shelter-in-place orders, some of which\nhave been renewed, it remains unknown when\nthere will be a return to normal economic\nactivity due to\n\ncontinued significant numbers of new cases,\npotential impact of new COVID strains,\nuncertain vaccination rollout timeline, and\nincreased economic stress associated with the\npandemic. Truist temporarily limited access to\ncertain offices, limited branches to drive-\nthru and appointment only, suspended some\nservices and the majority of the Company's\nworkforce is working remotely, which may\nincrease cybersecurity risks to the Company.\nApproximately 90% of branches are open and\nunlocked, or open with controlled access.\nTruist continues to follow appropriate\nCOVID-19 safety protocols, including proper\nsocial distancing. Commercial clients are\nexperiencing varying levels of disruptions or\nrestrictions on their business activity and\nsupply chains, closures of facilities or\ndecreases in demand for their products and\nservices. Consumer clients are experiencing\ninterrupted income or unemployment. Certain\nindustries have been particularly susceptible\nto the effects of the pandemic, such as\nhotels, resorts, cruise lines, oil and gas\ncompanies, senior and acute care facilities,\nrestaurants, and other sensitive retail\nbusinesses, and Truist has outstanding loans\nto clients in these industries. In 2020,\nseveral credit rating agencies downgraded\ntheir outlook on U.S. banks due in part to the\nconcerns presented by the pandemic. The global\nfinancial markets have also experienced\nsignificant volatility. The duration of this\nsevere economic disruption and its related\nfinancial impact cannot be reasonably\nestimated at this time.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic have already\nresulted in an increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses, a reduction of fee income, a\nreduction of net interest margin and an\nincrease in expenses. Prolonged continuation\nof current conditions could worsen these\nimpacts and also affect the Company's capital\nand liquidity position, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair\nthe value of collateral securing loans, cause\nan outflow of deposits, cause significant\nproperty damage, in case of civil unrest or\nvandalism, influence the recognition of credit\nlosses on loans and securities and further\nincrease the allowance for credit losses,\nresult in additional lost revenue, cause\nadditional increases in expenses, result in\ngoodwill impairment charges, result in the\nimpairment of other financial and nonfinancial\nassets, and increase the Company's cost of\ncapital.\n\nIntensive government actions to mitigate the\neconomic suffering caused by the pandemic may\nnot be successful or may result in increased\npressure on the banking sector. Net interest\nmargin has been, and is likely to continue to\nbe, affected by the very low interest rate\nenvironment. The application of forbearance\nand payment deferral policies beyond any\nstatutory requirements may impact Truist's\ninterest income. Truist participated in the\nSBA's PPP, which was recently expanded to\npermit a second round of funding, as an\neligible lender with the benefit of a\ngovernment guaranty of loans to small business\nclients, many of whom may face difficulties\neven after being granted such a loan. The\nCompany faces increased risks, in terms of\ncredit, fraud risk and litigation, in light of\nparticipation in this program. Truist has been\nnamed in several lawsuits relating to its\nparticipation in the PPP.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 23\nIt is possible that the pandemic and its\naftermath will lead to a prolonged economic\nslowdown or recession in the U.S. economy or\nthe world economy in general. The ultimate\nimpact on the Company's financial condition,\nresults of operation, and liquidity and\ncapital position will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\ncannot be predicted, including new information\nwhich may emerge concerning the severity of\nthe pandemic and the actions to contain or\ntreat its impact. Moreover, the effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic will heighten the other\nrisks described in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Market Risks                                \n                                              \nChanges in interest rates could adversely\naffect revenue and expenses, the value of\nassets and liabilities, as well as the\navailability and cost of capital, cash flows\nand liquidity.\n\nTruist\u2019s balance sheet can be sensitive to\nmovements in market interest rates and spreads\nas well as basis risk arising from the\nCompany's ALM activities, which management\nmust closely monitor. In addition to the\nimpact of the general economy, changes in\ninterest rates or in valuations in the debt or\nequity markets could directly impact the\nCompany in one or more of the following ways:\n\n\u2022 The yield on earning assets and rates paid\non interest-bearing liabilities may change in\ndisproportionate ways; or\n\n\u2022 The value of financial instruments held\ncould change adversely.\n\nRegional and local economic conditions,\ncompetitive pressures and the policies of\nregulatory authorities affect interest income\nand interest expense. When interest rates\nrise, funding costs may rise faster than the\nyield the Company earns on assets, causing net\ninterest margin to contract. Higher interest\nrates may also result in lower mortgage\nproduction income and elevated charge-offs in\ncertain categories of the loan portfolio.\nConversely, when interest rates fall, the\nyield the Company earns on assets may fall\nfaster than the Company's ability to lower\nrates paid on deposits or borrowings.\n\nCertain investment securities, notably MBS,\nare very sensitive to changes in rates.\nGenerally, when rates rise, prepayments will\ndecrease and the duration of MBS will\nincrease. Conversely, when rates fall,\nprepayments of principal and interest will\nincrease and the duration of MBS will\ndecrease.\n\nIn addition, in response to the outbreak of\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its economic\nconsequences, the FRB lowered its target for\nthe federal funds rate to a range of 0% to\n0.25%. Low rates increase the risk of a\nnegative interest rate environment, either\nbroadly or for some types of instruments. For\nexample, in March 2020 the yields on one-month\nand three-month Treasuries briefly dropped\nbelow zero. A negative interest rate\nenvironment could have a material adverse\neffect on Truist's financial condition and\nresults of operations. In a negative interest\nrate environment, some depositors may choose\nto withdraw their deposits in lieu of paying\nan interest rate to Truist to hold such\ndeposits. Negative rates would also diminish\nthe spreads on loans and securities. Further,\nTruist cannot predict the nature or timing of\nfuture changes in monetary policies in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic or the\neffects that they may have on the Company's\nactivities and financial results.\n\nThe monetary and fiscal policies of the\nfederal government and its agencies could have\na material adverse effect on profitability.\n\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies,\nincluding FRB policies, can adversely affect\nprofitability and cannot be controlled or\npredicted by the Company. FRB policies can:\n\n\u2022 significantly impact the cost of funds, as\nwell as the return on assets, both of which\ncan have an impact on interest income;\n\n\u2022 materially affect the value of financial\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect borrowers through higher\ndebt servicing costs and potentially increase\nthe risk that they may fail to repay their\nloan obligations; and\n\n\u2022 artificially inflate asset values during\nprolonged periods of accommodative policy,\nwhich could in turn cause volatile markets and\nrapidly declining collateral values.\n\nFinancial results, lending or other business\nactivities could be materially affected by a\ndeterioration of economic conditions.\n\nA prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S.\neconomy as a whole or in any regional markets\nthat Truist serves, or any deterioration in\neconomic conditions or the financial markets\nmay disrupt or dampen the economy, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company's\nfinancial condition and results.\n\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, the\nCompany may see lower demand for loans by\ncreditworthy clients, reducing the Company's\ninterest income. In addition, if unemployment\nlevels increase or if real estate prices\ndecrease, the Company would expect to incur\nhigher charge-offs and may incur higher\nexpenses in connection with adjustments to the\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used to\nestimate the allowance for credit losses in\naccordance with CECL requirements. These\nconditions may adversely affect not only\nconsumer loan performance but also commercial\nand industrial and commercial real estate\nloans, especially for those businesses that\nrely on the health of industries or properties\nthat may suffer from deteriorating economic\nconditions. The ability of these borrowers to\nrepay their loans may be reduced, causing the\nCompany to incur higher credit losses.\n\nThe deterioration of economic conditions also\ncould adversely affect financial results for\nthe Company's fee-based businesses. Truist\nearns fee income from, among other activities,\nmanaging assets for clients and providing\nbrokerage and other investment advisory and\nwealth management services. Investment\nmanagement fees are often based on the value\nof assets under management and a decrease in\nthe market prices of those assets could reduce\nthe Company's fee income. Changes in stock or\nfixed income market prices or client\npreferences could affect the trading activity\nof investors, reducing commissions and other\nfees earned from the Company's brokerage\nbusiness. Poor economic conditions and\nvolatile or unstable financial markets would\nlikely adversely affect the Company's capital\nmarkets-related businesses.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company's operations,\nearnings and financial condition.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company's operations,\nearnings and financial condition. The\nmacroeconomic environment in the United States\nis susceptible to global events and volatility\nin financial markets. For example, trade\nnegotiations between the U.S. and other\nnations remains uncertain and could adversely\nimpact economic and market conditions for the\nCompany and its clients and counterparties.\n\nA negative change in economic conditions, the\nperformance of foreign sovereign debt, changes\nof trade policies and other matters could\nadversely affect the Company's business,\nfinancial condition and liquidity. Domestic\nand global political activity, geopolitical\nmatters, including international political\nunrest or disturbances, terrorist activities,\nmilitary conflicts, concerns over energy\nprices, trade wars and economic instability or\nrecession in certain regions could cause\nvolatility in the financial markets, undermine\ninvestor confidence or cause a contraction of\navailable credit. Any of these could reduce\nthe value of the Company's assets or cause a\nreduction in liquidity that adversely impacts\nthe Company's financial condition and results\nof operations.\n\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely\naffect Truist's profitability and financial\ncondition.\n\nLIBOR and certain other interest rate\nbenchmarks are the subject of recent national,\ninternational and other regulatory guidance\nand proposals for reform. These reforms may\ncause such benchmarks to perform differently\nthan in the past or have other consequences\nwhich cannot be predicted. LIBOR in its\ncurrent form was anticipated to no longer be\navailable after 2021.\n\nOn November 30, 2020 the administrator of\nLIBOR announced it will consult on its\nintention to cease publication of the one-week\nand two-month settings immediately following\nthe LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021,\nand the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings\nimmediately following the LIBOR publication on\nJune 30, 2023. While there is no consensus on\nwhat rate or rates may become accepted\nalternatives to LIBOR, a group of market\nparticipants convened by the FRB, the ARRC,\nhas selected the SOFR as its recommended\nalternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. In 2020,\nTruist began offering SOFR-based lending\nsolutions to wholesale and consumer clients,\nand entered into SOFR-based derivative\ncontracts.\n\nThe U.S. federal banking agencies issued a\nstatement in November 2020 encouraging banks\nto transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR as\nsoon as practicable and to stop entering into\nnew contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR by\nDecember 31, 2021. SOFR or other alternative\nreference rates may perform differently than\nLIBOR in response to changing market\nconditions. For example, SOFR could experience\ngreater decreases during times of economic\nstress, which could require the Company to\nlend at lower rates at times when the\nCompany's borrowing costs are increasing.\n\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to\nalternative reference rates is complex and\ncould have a range of adverse effects on the\nCompany's business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. In particular, any such\ntransition could:\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates received\nor paid on the revenue and expenses associated\nwith or the value of the Company's LIBOR-based\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates received\nor paid on the revenue and expenses associated\nwith or the value of other securities or\nfinancial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in\ndetermining market interest rates globally;\n\n\u2022 prompt inquiries or other actions from\nregulators in respect of the Company's\npreparation and readiness for the replacement\nof LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\nand\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\n\u2022 result in disputes, litigation or other\nactions with borrowers or counterparties about\nthe interpretation and enforceability of\ncertain fallback language in LIBOR-based\ncontracts and securities.\n\nThe transition away from LIBOR to an\nalternative reference rate or rates will\nrequire the transition to or development of\nappropriate systems, models and analytics to\neffectively transition the Company's risk\nmanagement and other processes from LIBOR-\nbased products to those based on the\napplicable alternative reference rate, such as\nSOFR. Truist has developed a LIBOR transition\nteam and project plan that outlines timelines\nand priorities to prepare its processes,\nsystems and people to support this transition.\nTimelines and priorities include assessing the\nimpact on the Company's clients, as well as\nassessing system requirements for operational\nprocesses. There can be no guarantee that\nthese efforts will successfully mitigate the\noperational risks associated with the\ntransition away from LIBOR to an alternative\nreference rate.\n\nThe manner and impact of the transition from\nLIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as\nwell as the effect of these developments on\nthe Company's funding costs, loan, investment\nand trading securities portfolios, and ALM, is\nuncertain.\n                                              \n  Credit Risks                                \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to credit risk by\nlending or committing to lend money, or\nentering into a letter of credit or other\ntypes of contracts with counterparties.\n\nTruist incurs credit risk, which is the risk\nof loss if the Company's borrowers or\ncounterparties fail to perform according to\nthe terms of their contracts. A number of\nproducts expose the Company to credit risk,\nincluding loans and leases, lending\ncommitments, derivatives, trading assets and\ninvestment securities. Changes in credit\nquality can have a significant impact on the\nCompany's earnings and capital position. The\nCompany estimates and establishes reserves for\ncredit risks and credit losses inherent in its\ndetermination of credit exposure. This\nprocess, which is critical to the Company's\nfinancial results and condition, requires\ncomplex calculations and extensive use of\njudgment, considering both external and\nborrower-specific factors that might impair\nthe ability of borrowers to repay their loans.\nAs is the case with any such assessments,\nthere is always the chance that the Company\nwill fail to identify all pertinent factors or\nthat the Company will fail to accurately\nestimate the impacts of factors identified.\n\nCredit losses may exceed the amount of the\nCompany's reserves as a result of changing\neconomic conditions, including falling real\nestate or commodity prices and higher\nunemployment or other factors such as changes\nin borrower behavior. There is no assurance\nthat reserves will be sufficient to cover all\nincurred credit losses. In the event of\nsignificant deterioration in economic\nconditions, the Company may be required to\nincrease reserves in future periods, which\nwould reduce the Company's earnings and\npotentially impact its capital.\n\nThe Company may have more credit risk and\nhigher credit losses to the extent that loans\nare concentrated by loan type, industry\nsegment, borrower type or location of the\nborrower or collateral.\n\nThe Company's credit risk and credit losses\ncan increase if the Company's loans are\nconcentrated in borrowers engaged in the same\nor similar activities or in borrowers who as a\ngroup may be uniquely or disproportionately\naffected by economic or market conditions.\n\nDeterioration in economic conditions, housing\nconditions or real estate values, including as\na result of climate change or natural\ndisasters, in the markets in which the Company\noperates could result in materially higher\ncredit losses. The Company is also subject to\nphysical risks, which could manifest in the\nform of asset quality deterioration and could\nbe exacerbated by specific portfolio\nconcentrations, and transition risks, which\ncould manifest through longer-term shifts in\nmarket dynamics and consumer preferences in\nspecific industries that may be more sensitive\nor vulnerable to a transition to a low carbon\neconomy. Shorter term transition risks arising\nfrom regulatory changes or technological\nbreakthroughs may require an acceleration of\ncertain risk mitigation strategies.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risks                             \n                                              \nTruist's liquidity could be impaired by an\ninability to access short-term funding or an\nunforeseen outflow of cash.\n\nLiquidity is essential to Truist's businesses.\nWhen volatility or disruptions occur in the\nwholesale funding markets, the Company's\nability to access short-term liquidity could\nbe materially impaired. In addition, other\nfactors outside of the Company's control, such\nas a general market disruption or an\noperational problem that affects third\nparties, could impair the Company's ability to\naccess short-term funding or create an\nunforeseen outflow of cash due to, among other\nfactors, draws on unfunded commitments or\ndeposit attrition. The Company's inability to\naccess short-term funding or capital markets\ncould constrain the Company's ability to make\nnew loans or meet existing lending commitments\nand could ultimately jeopardize the Company's\noverall liquidity and capitalization.\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix\ncould increase Truist's funding costs.\n\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of\nfunding. Truist competes with banks and other\nfinancial institutions for deposits and as a\nresult, could lose deposits in the future or\nsee an increase in costs associated with\nmaintaining deposits. Clients may shift their\ndeposits into higher cost products or the\nCompany may need to raise interest rates to\navoid deposit attrition. Funding costs may\nalso increase if deposits lost are replaced\nwith wholesale funding. Higher funding costs\nreduce Truist's net interest margin, net\ninterest income, and net income.\n\nTruist relies on the mortgage secondary market\nand GSEs for some of the Company's liquidity.\n\nTruist sells a portion of the mortgage loans\noriginated to reduce the Company's retained\ncredit risk and to provide funding capacity\nfor originating additional loans. GSEs could\nlimit their purchases of conforming loans due\nto capital constraints or other changes in\ntheir criteria for conforming loans (e.g.,\nmaximum loan amount or borrower eligibility).\nThis potential reduction in purchases could\nlimit the Company's ability to fund new loans.\n\nProposals have been presented to reform the\nhousing finance market in the U.S., including\nthe role of the GSEs in the housing finance\nmarket. The extent and timing of any such\nregulatory reform of the housing finance\nmarket and the GSEs, as well as any effect on\nthe Company's business and financial results,\nare uncertain.\n\nAny reduction in the Company's credit rating\ncould increase the cost of the Company's\nfunding from the capital markets.\n\nRatings agencies regularly evaluate Truist and\nits subsidiaries. Ratings are based on a\nnumber of factors, including the financial\nstrength of the Company as well as conditions\naffecting the financial services industry\ngenerally. Failure to maintain those ratings\ncould adversely affect funding cost and\nincrease the Company's cost of capital. A\ncredit downgrade might also affect the\nCompany's ability to attract or retain\ndeposits from commercial and corporate\nclients. Additionally, the Company's ability\nto conduct derivatives business with certain\nclients and counterparties could also be\nimpacted and could trigger obligations to make\ncash or collateral payments to certain clients\nand counterparties.\n\nThe Parent Company has less access to funding\nsources and its liquidity could be constrained\nif the Bank becomes unable to pay dividends\nduring a time of stress.\n\nThe Parent Company relies upon capital markets\naccess and dividends from affiliates for\nfunding and has less access to contingent\nfunding sources than the Bank. If the Bank\nwere subject to a financial stress, its\ndividends to the Parent Company could be\nreduced or eliminated in order to support Bank\ncapital ratios or other regulatory\nrequirements. This would increase the Parent\nCompany's reliance on capital markets at a\ntime when spreads and funding costs are likely\nelevated due the stress impacting the Bank.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risks                            \n                                              \nTruist is subject to extensive and evolving\ngovernment regulation and supervision, which\ncould increase the cost of doing business,\nlimit Truist's ability to make investments and\ngenerate revenue and lead to costly\nenforcement actions.\n\nThe banking and financial services industries\nare highly regulated. Truist is subject to\nsupervision, regulation and examination by\nregulators, including the FRB, FDIC, NCCOB,\nSEC, CFTC, CFPB, FINRA and various state\nregulatory agencies. The statutory and\nregulatory framework governing Truist is\ngenerally intended to protect depositors, the\nDIF, clients, and the U.S. financial system as\na whole, and not Truist's debt holders or\nshareholders. Reform of the financial services\nindustry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act,\nincluding the EGRRCPA and other legislative,\nregulatory and technological changes, affect\nthe Company's operations.\n\nThese laws and regulations and Truist's\ninability to act in certain instances without\nreceiving prior regulatory approval affect\nTruist's lending practices, capital structure,\ninvestment practices, dividend policy, ability\nto repurchase common stock and ability to\npursue strategic acquisitions, among other\nactivities. Changes to statutes, regulations\nor regulatory policies or their interpretation\nor implementation and the continued\nheightening of regulatory requirements could\naffect Truist in substantial and unpredictable\nways. Federal and state banking regulators\nalso possess broad powers to take supervisory\nactions as they deem appropriate. These\nsupervisory actions may result in higher\ncapital requirements, higher deposit insurance\npremiums and limitations on the Company's\nactivities that could have a material adverse\neffect on operations or profitability.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\nIn recent years, both Congress and the federal\nbanking regulators have engaged in a\nrebalancing of the post financial crisis legal\nand regulatory framework, particularly by\ntailoring enhanced prudential standards to the\nsize, risk profile and complexity of the\nbanking organization. It is possible that the\nnew presidential administration and the new\nCongress could reconsider this rebalancing of\nthe legal and regulatory framework and also\nimpose significant new regulatory and\nsupervisory burdens on the financial sector.\nTruist expects that its businesses will remain\nsubject to extensive regulation and\nsupervision. Any potential new regulations or\nmodifications to existing regulations would\nlikely necessitate changes to Truist's\nexisting regulatory compliance and risk\nmanagement infrastructure. Compliance with new\nregulations and supervisory initiatives,\nincluding those newly applicable as a result\nof the Merger may increase costs. In addition,\nconcerns over climate change may prompt\nchanges in regulations that, in turn, could\nhave a material adverse impact on asset values\nand the financial performance of Truist's\nbusinesses and its clients.\n\nTruist is subject to heightened requirements\nunder the enhanced prudential standards and\nexpects increased supervisory scrutiny,\nincluding, for example, single counterparty\ncredit limits, heightened expectations with\nrespect to governance, risk management and\ninternal controls and additional capital and\nliquidity requirements.\n\nThe financial services industry faces scrutiny\nfrom bank supervisors in the examination\nprocess and stringent enforcement of\nregulations on both the federal and state\nlevels. Areas of focus in the recent past have\nbeen with respect to mortgage-related\npractices, student lending practices, auto\nlending practices, sales practices and related\nincentive compensation programs and other\nconsumer compliance matters. Truist continues\nto be subject to examinations and ongoing\nmonitoring to assess compliance with BSA/AML\nlaws and regulations, as well as sanctions\ncompliance administered by the OFAC. For\nexample, during November 2019, SunTrust Bank\nentered into a consent order with the FRB in\nconnection with marketing, enrollment and\nbilling practices related to deposit account\nadd-on and similar products provided to\ncertain business customers. Current and future\nactions by regulators could impact Truist's\noperations. See additional disclosures in the\n\"Regulatory Considerations\" section.\n\nThe Company is subject to laws, rules and\nregulations regarding compliance with privacy\npolicies and the disclosure, collection, use,\nsharing and safeguarding of personal\nidentifiable information of certain parties.\nThere has recently been an increase in\nlegislative and regulatory efforts to protect\nthe privacy of consumer data. These\ninitiatives may limit how companies can use\ncustomer data and may increase compliance\ncomplexity and related costs, result in\nsignificant financial penalties for compliance\nfailures and limit the Company's ability to\ndevelop new products or respond to\ntechnological changes. Such legal requirements\nalso could heighten the reputational impact of\nperceived misuses of customer data by the\nCompany and third parties.\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny or the results\nof an investigation or examination may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. There is no assurance\nthat those actions will not result in\nregulatory settlements or other enforcement\nactions against Truist. Furthermore, a single\nevent involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings,\neither by multiple federal and state agencies\nand officials in the United States or, in some\ninstances, regulators and other governmental\nofficials in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal banking regulators and law\nenforcement agencies. This enforcement\nauthority includes, among other things, the\nability to assess significant civil or\ncriminal monetary penalties, fines or\nrestitution; to issue cease and desist or\nremoval orders; and to initiate injunctive\nactions against banking organizations and\ninstitution-affiliated parties. These\nenforcement actions may be initiated for\nviolations of laws and regulations and unsafe\nor unsound practices.\n\nA failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements and expectations could expose the\nCompany to fines, regulatory penalties, other\ncosts, reputational damage and regulatory or\nenforcement actions, such as limitations on\nengaging in new activities or expanding\ngeographically. In some cases, governmental\nauthorities have required criminal pleas or\nother extraordinary terms as part of such\nsettlements, which could have significant\nconsequences for a financial institution,\nincluding loss of clients, restrictions on the\nability to access the capital markets and the\ninability to operate certain businesses or\noffer certain products for a period of time.\nViolations of laws and regulations or deemed\ndeficiencies in risk management practices also\nmay be incorporated into Truist's confidential\nsupervisory ratings. A downgrade in these\nratings or these or other regulatory actions\nand settlements, could limit Truist's ability\nto conduct expansionary activities for a\nperiod of time and require new or additional\nregulatory approvals before engaging in\ncertain other business activities. Any future\nenforcement action could have a material\nadverse impact.\n\nRegulatory changes may reduce Truist's\nrevenues, limit the types of financial\nservices and products it may offer, alter the\ninvestments it makes, affect the manner in\nwhich it operates its businesses, increase its\nlitigation and regulatory costs should it fail\nto appropriately comply with new or modified\nlaws and regulatory requirements and increase\nthe ability of non-banks to offer competing\nfinancial services and products.\n\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect the Company's\nbusiness, operations and ability to pay\ndividends or otherwise return capital to\nshareholders.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements established by the FRB\nand the FDIC. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the BCBS and then\napplied, with adjustments, in each country by\nthe appropriate domestic regulatory bodies.\nDomestic regulatory agencies have the ability\nto apply stricter capital and liquidity\nstandards than those developed by the BCBS. In\nseveral instances, the U.S. banking agencies\nhave done so with respect to U.S. banking\norganizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of the\nCompany's capital and liquidity may prevent\nthe Company from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force the Company to take\nactions contrary to their interests. For\nexample, Truist may be limited in its ability\nto pay or increase dividends or otherwise\nreturn capital to shareholders. In addition,\nthese requirements may impact the amount and\ntype of loans the Company is able to make.\nTruist may be constrained in its ability to\nexpand, either organically or through mergers\nand acquisitions. These requirements may cause\nthe Company to sell or refrain from acquiring\nassets where the capital requirements appear\ninconsistent with the assets' underlying\nrisks. In addition, liquidity standards\nrequire the Company to maintain holdings of\nhighly liquid investments, thereby reducing\nthe Company's ability to invest in less liquid\nassets, even if more desirable from a balance\nsheet or interest rate risk management\nperspective. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to additional\ncapital and liquidity requirements.\n\nThe liquidity standards applicable to large\nU.S. banking organizations have also been\nsupplemented in recent years. For example, in\nOctober 2020, the U.S. banking agencies\nfinalized rules to implement the NSFR, which\nis designed to ensure that banking\norganizations maintain a stable funding\nprofile in relation to their asset composition\nand off-balance sheet activities.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements applicable to Truist\nand Truist Bank, the Company's broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to capital\nrequirements established by the SEC.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nreceive periodic review and revision by the\nBCBS and the U.S. banking agencies. Changes to\ncapital and liquidity requirements may require\nTruist or Truist Bank to maintain more or\nhigher quality capital or greater liquidity\nand could increase some of the potential\nadverse effects described above.\n\nTruist is subject to certain risks related to\noriginating and selling mortgages and may be\nrequired to repurchase mortgage loans or\nindemnify mortgage loan purchasers.\n\nTruist is required to make customary\nrepresentations and warranties to the\npurchaser about the mortgage loans and the\nmanner in which they were originated when\nselling mortgage loans or loan\nsecuritizations. An increase in the number of\nrepurchase and indemnity demands from\npurchasers related to representations and\nwarranties on loans sold could result in an\nincrease in the amount of losses for loan\nrepurchases. Truist also bears a risk of loss\nfrom borrower defaults for multi-family\ncommercial mortgage loans sold to FNMA.\n\nIn addition to repurchase claims from GSEs,\nTruist could be subject to indemnification\nclaims from non-GSE purchasers of the\nCompany's loans. Claims could be made if\nTruist fails to conform to statements about\nthe quality of the mortgage loans sold, the\nmanner in which the loans were originated and\nunderwritten or to comply with state and\nfederal law.\n\nTruist faces risks as a servicer of loans.\n\nThe Company acts as servicer and master\nservicer for mortgage loans included in\nsecuritizations and for unsecuritized mortgage\nloans owned by investors. As a servicer or\nmaster servicer for those loans, the Company\nhas certain contractual obligations to the\nsecuritization trusts, investors or other\nthird parties. As a servicer, Truist's\nobligations include foreclosing on defaulted\nmortgage loans or, to the extent consistent\nwith the applicable securitization or other\ninvestor agreement, considering alternatives\nto foreclosure such as loan modifications or\nshort sales. In the Company's capacity as a\nmaster servicer, obligations include\noverseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by\nthe servicer. Generally, the Company's\nservicing obligations are set by contract, for\nwhich the Company receives a contractual fee.\nHowever, GSEs can amend their servicing\nguidelines, which can increase the scope or\ncosts of the services required without any\ncorresponding increase in the Company's\nservicing fee. Further, the CFPB has\nimplemented national servicing standards which\nhave increased the scope and costs of services\nwhich the Company is required to perform. In\naddition, there has been a significant\nincrease in state laws that impose additional\nservicing requirements that increase the scope\nand cost of the Company's servicing\nobligations. As a servicer, the Company also\nadvances expenses on behalf of investors which\nit may be unable to collect.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 29\nA material breach of the Company's obligations\nas servicer or master servicer may result in\ncontract termination if the breach is not\ncured within a specified period of time\nfollowing notice, which can generally be given\nby the securitization trustee or a specified\npercentage of security holders, causing the\nCompany to lose servicing income. In addition,\nthe Company may be required to indemnify the\nsecuritization trustee against losses from any\nfailure by the Company, as a servicer or\nmaster servicer, to perform the Company's\nservicing obligations or any act or omission\non the Company's part that involves willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence.\nFor certain investors and certain\ntransactions, Truist may be contractually\nobligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or\nreimburse the investor for credit losses\nincurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing\nerrors with respect to the loan. The Company\nmay be subject to increased repurchase\nobligations as a result of claims made that\nthe Company did not satisfy its obligations as\na servicer or master servicer. The Company may\nalso experience increased loss severity on\nrepurchases, which may require a material\nincrease to the Company's repurchase reserve.\n\nThe Company has and may continue to receive\nindemnification requests related to the\nCompany's servicing of loans owned or insured\nby other parties, primarily GSEs. Typically,\nsuch a claim seeks to impose a compensatory\nfee on the Company for departures from GSE\nservice levels. In most cases, this is related\nto delays in the foreclosure process.\nAdditionally, the Company has received\nindemnification requests where an investor or\ninsurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of\nthe servicing agreement. While the number of\nsuch claims has been small, these could\nincrease in the future.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risks                             \n                                              \nTruist may face the risk of financial loss or\nnegative impact resulting from ineffective\nstrategy setting and execution, adverse\nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness\nto changes in the external environment.\n\nEmbedded within strategic risks are risks\nassociated with:\n\n\u2022 maintaining a level of earnings appropriate\nto support growth objectives and the ability\nto maintain dividends in various economic\ncycles,\n\n\u2022 successful delivery of innovation and\ntechnology strategies that transform the\nclient experience as well as the way Truist\nconducts business, and\n\n\u2022 changes and events within the external\nenvironment, including geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive\nand regulatory factors.\n\nAny of the foregoing may impact the successful\nexecution of Truist's strategy.\n\nCompetition may reduce Truist's client base or\ncause Truist to modify pricing for products\nand services in order to maintain market\nshare.\n\nTruist operates in a highly competitive\nindustry that could become even more\ncompetitive with neo-banks and other fintechs.\nIncreased competition could arise from\ntechnological advancements, legislative and\nregulatory changes, as well as competition\nfrom other financial services companies, some\nof which may be subject to less extensive\nregulation than Truist. The Company's success\ndepends, in part, on the Company's ability to\nadapt its offering of products and services to\nevolving industry standards and client\nexpectations. The widespread adoption of new\ntechnologies has required and will continue to\nrequire substantial investments to modify\nexisting products and services or to develop\nnew products and services. In addition, there\nis increasing pressure to provide products and\nservices at lower prices further reducing\ncontribution margins. The Company may not be\nsuccessful in introducing new products and\nservices in response to industry trends or\ndevelopments in technology or those new\nproducts may not achieve market acceptance.\n\nTruist also competes with nonbank companies\ninside and outside of the Company's market\narea and, in some cases, with companies other\nthan those traditionally considered financial\nsector participants. In particular, technology\ncompanies are increasingly focusing on the\nfinancial sector, either in partnership with\ncompetitor banking organizations or on their\nown. These companies generally are not subject\nto the same regulatory burdens as main street\nfinancial institutions and may accordingly\nrealize certain cost strategies and offer\nproducts and services at more favorable rates\nand with greater convenience to the client.\nThis competition could result in the loss of\nclients and revenue in areas where fintechs\nare operating. As the pace of technology and\nchange advance, continuous innovation is\nexpected to exert long-term pressure on the\nfinancial services industry.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies by\ncompetitors, including internet banking\nservices, mobile applications, advanced ATM\nfunctionality and cryptocurrencies could\nrequire the Company to make substantial\ninvestments to modify or adapt the Company's\nexisting products and services or even\nradically alter the way Truist conducts\nbusiness. These and other capital investments\nin the Company's business may not produce\nexpected growth in earnings anticipated at the\ntime of the expenditure.\n\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCertain external environmental factors could\nalso impact the Company's strategy. Increasing\nfrequency and severity of impacts from natural\ndisasters brought on by climate change may\nalter the Company's strategic direction in\norder to mitigate certain financial risks.\nWhile material impact from climate change is\nexpected to occur over a longer time horizon,\nthe acceleration of a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy could present idiosyncratic\nrisks in certain sectors and carbon intensive\nindustries over time. Climate change is\nexpected to present incremental risks to the\nexecution of the Company's long-term strategy.\nIn addition, concerns over climate change may\nprompt changes in regulations that, in turn,\ncould have a material adverse impact on asset\nvalues and the financial performance of\nTruist's businesses, and those of its clients.\n\nTruist may not be able to complete future\nmergers or acquisitions.\n\nThe Company must generally satisfy a number of\nmeaningful conditions before completing an\nacquisition of another bank or BHC, including\nfederal and state regulatory approvals. In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nor BHC acquisition, bank regulators will\nconsider, among other factors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on competition; financial\ncondition and future prospects, including\ncurrent and projected capital ratios and\nlevels; the competence, experience and\nintegrity of management; record of compliance\nwith laws and regulations; the convenience and\nneeds of the communities to be served,\nincluding the acquiring institution's record\nof compliance under the CRA; the effectiveness\nof the acquiring institution in combating\nmoney laundering activities; and protests from\nvarious stakeholders. In addition, U.S.\nregulators must take systemic risk to the U.S.\nfinancial system into account when evaluating\nwhether to approve a potential acquisition\ntransaction involving a large financial\ninstitution like Truist. There is no certainty\nas to when or if or on what terms and\nconditions, any required regulatory approvals\nwill be granted for any potential acquisition.\nIn specific cases, Truist may be required to\nsell banks or branches or take other actions\nas a condition to receiving regulatory\napproval. An inability to satisfy other\nconditions necessary to consummate an\nacquisition transaction, such as third party\nlitigation, a judicial order blocking the\ntransaction or lack of shareholder approval,\ncould also prevent the Company from completing\nan announced acquisition.\n\nTruist has businesses other than banking that\nare subject to a variety of risks.\n\nTruist is a diversified financial services\ncompany and this diversity subjects the\nCompany's earnings to a broader variety of\nrisks and uncertainties. Other businesses in\naddition to banking that the Company operates\ninclude insurance, investment banking,\nsecurities underwriting and market making,\nloan syndications, investment management and\nadvice and retail and wholesale brokerage\nservices offered through the Company's\nsubsidiaries. These businesses entail\nsignificant market, operational, credit,\ncompliance, technology, legal and other risks\nthat could materially adversely impact the\nCompany's results of operations.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risks                          \n                                              \nNegative public opinion could damage the\nCompany's reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues.\n\nTruist's earnings and capital are subject to\nrisks associated with negative public opinion.\nNegative public opinion could result from the\nCompany's actual or alleged conduct in any\nnumber of activities, including lending, sales\nand other operating practices, corporate\ngovernance, acquisitions, a breach of client\nor teammate information, the failure of any\nproduct or service sold to meet clients'\nexpectations or applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Negative public opinion could\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to\nattract and retain clients and personnel and\ncan result in litigation and regulatory\nactions. Actual or alleged conduct by one of\nthe Company's businesses can result in\nnegative public opinion about the Company's\nother businesses. Actual or alleged conduct by\nanother financial institution can result in\nnegative public opinion about the financial\nservices industry in general and, as a result,\nadversely affect Truist.\n\nScrutiny of the Company's sales, training and\nincentive compensation practices could damage\nthe Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues.\n\nThe Company may face increased scrutiny of the\nCompany's sales and other business practices,\ntraining practices, incentive compensation\ndesign and governance, and quality assurance\nand client complaint resolution practices.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company's\nprocesses and actions will meet regulatory\nstandards or expectations. Findings from self-\nidentified or regulatory reviews may require\nresponsive actions, including increased\ninvestments in compliance systems and\npersonnel or the payment of fines, penalties,\nincreased regulatory assessments or client\nredress and may increase legal or reputational\nrisk exposures.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\n                                              \n  Operational Risks                           \n                                              \nLitigation may adversely affect the Company's\nresults.\n\nThe Company is subject to litigation in the\nordinary course of business. Claims and legal\nactions, including supervisory actions by the\nCompany's regulators, could involve large\nmonetary claims and significant defense costs.\nThe outcome of litigation and regulatory\nmatters as well as the timing of ultimate\nresolution are inherently difficult to\npredict.\n\nActual legal and other costs of resolving\nclaims may be greater than the Company's legal\nreserves. The ultimate resolution of a pending\nlegal proceeding, depending on the remedy\nsought and granted, could materially adversely\naffect the Company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nIn addition, governmental authorities have, at\ntimes, sought criminal penalties against\ncompanies in the financial services sector for\nviolations, and, at times, have required an\nadmission of wrongdoing from financial\ninstitutions in connection with resolving such\nmatters. Criminal convictions or admissions of\nwrongdoing in a settlement with the government\ncan lead to greater exposure in civil\nlitigation and reputational harm.\n\nSubstantial legal liability or significant\nregulatory action against the Company could\nhave material adverse financial effects or\ncause significant reputational harm, which\nadversely impact the Company's business\nprospects. Further, the Company may be exposed\nto substantial uninsured liabilities, which\ncould adversely affect the Company's results\nof operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company may incur fines, penalties and\nother negative consequences from regulatory\nviolations, including inadvertent or\nunintentional violations.\n\nTruist maintains systems and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that it complies with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can\nbe no assurance that these will be effective.\nIn addition to fines and penalties, the\nCompany may suffer other negative consequences\nfrom regulatory violations including\nrestrictions on certain activities, such as\nthe Company's mortgage business, which may\naffect the Company's relationship with the\nGSEs and may also damage the Company's\nreputation and this in turn might materially\naffect the Company's business and results of\noperations.\n\nFurther, some legal frameworks provide for the\nimposition of fines or penalties for\nnoncompliance even when the noncompliance was\ninadvertent or unintentional and even when\nthere were systems and procedures in place\ndesigned to ensure compliance. For example,\nTruist is subject to regulations issued by\nOFAC that prohibit financial institutions from\nparticipating in the transfer of property\nbelonging to the governments of certain\nforeign countries and designated nationals of\nthose countries. OFAC may impose penalties for\ninadvertent or unintentional violations even\nif reasonable processes are in place to\nprevent the violations. Courts may uphold\nsignificant additional penalties on financial\ninstitutions, even where the financial\ninstitution had already reimbursed the\ngovernment or other counterparties for actual\nlosses.\n\nTruist relies on other companies to provide\nkey components of the Company's business\ninfrastructure.\n\nThird parties provide key components of the\nCompany's business infrastructure, such as\nbanking services, data processing, business\nprocesses, internet connections and network\naccess. Any disruption in such services\nprovided by these third parties or any failure\nof these third parties to handle current or\nhigher volumes of use could adversely affect\nthe Company's ability to deliver products and\nservices to clients, to support teammates and\notherwise to conduct business. Technological\nor financial difficulties of a third party\nservice provider could adversely affect the\nCompany's business to the extent those\ndifficulties result in the interruption or\ndiscontinuation of services provided by that\nparty. Further, in some instances, the Company\nmay be responsible for failures of such third\nparties to comply with government regulations.\nThe Company is not insured against all types\nof losses as a result of third party failures\nand insurance coverage may be inadequate to\ncover all losses resulting from system\nfailures or other disruptions. Failures in the\nCompany's business infrastructure could\ninterrupt the operations or increase the costs\nof doing business.\n\nTruist depends on the expertise of key\npersonnel. If these individuals leave or\nchange their roles without effective\nreplacements, operations may suffer.\n\nThe Company's success depends, to a large\ndegree, on the continued services of executive\nofficers and other key personnel who have\nextensive experience in the industry. The\nCompany's business could be adversely impacted\nfrom the loss of key persons or failure to\nmanage a smooth transition to new personnel.\nThese risks may be exacerbated as the Company\ncontinues to integrate processes and systems\nsubsequent to the Merger.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company may not be able to hire or retain\nadditional qualified personnel and recruiting\nand compensation costs may increase as a\nresult of changes in the marketplace, which\nmay increase costs and adversely impact the\nCompany's ability to implement business\nstrategies.\n\nThe Company's success depends upon the ability\nto attract and retain high performing, diverse\nand well-qualified personnel. The Company\nfaces significant competition in the\nrecruitment of highly motivated teammates that\ncan deliver Truist's purpose, mission and\nvalues. The Company's ability to execute its\nbusiness strategy and provide high quality\nservice may suffer if the Company is unable to\nrecruit or retain a sufficient number of\nqualified teammates or if the costs of\nemployee compensation or benefits increase\nsubstantially. The U.S. banking agencies have\njointly issued comprehensive guidance designed\nto ensure that incentive compensation policies\ndo not undermine the safety and soundness of\nbanking organizations by encouraging teammates\nto take imprudent risks. This guidance\nsignificantly affects the amount, form and\ncontext of incentive compensation to\nteammates. The FRB, FDIC, SEC and other\nfederal regulatory agencies have jointly\nproposed rules, which would affect incentive\ncompensation. These rules, which have been\npending for several years, if finalized, may\nresult in additional costs and restrictions on\nthe form of the Company's incentive\ncompensation.\n\nThe Company's framework for managing risks may\nnot be effective.\n\nThe Company's risk management framework seeks\nto mitigate risk and loss. Truist has\nestablished policies, processes and procedures\nintended to identify, measure, monitor, report\nand analyze the types of risk to which the\nCompany is subject, including liquidity,\ncredit, market, operational, technology,\nreputational, legal, model and compliance\nrisk, among others. However, the Company's\nrisk management measures may not be fully\neffective in identifying and mitigating the\nCompany's risk exposure in all market\nenvironments or against all types of risk,\nincluding risks that are unidentified or\nunanticipated, even if the models for\nassessing risk are properly designed and\nimplemented. Some of the Company\u2019s methods of\nmanaging risk are based upon the Company's use\nof observed historical market behavior and\nmanagement's judgment. These methods may not\naccurately predict future exposures, which\ncould be significantly greater than historical\nmeasures indicate. If the Company's risk\nmanagement framework proves ineffective, it\ncould suffer unexpected losses and could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in Truist's business, which may\nimpact decisions made by Management and\nregulators.\n\nTruist relies on quantitative models to\nmeasure risks and to estimate certain\nfinancial values. Models may be used in such\nprocesses as determining the pricing of\nvarious products, grading loans and extending\ncredit, measuring interest rate and other\nmarket risks, predicting or estimating losses,\nassessing capital adequacy and calculating\neconomic and regulatory capital levels, as\nwell as estimating the value of financial\ninstruments and balance sheet items.\n\nPoorly designed or implemented models present\nthe risk that Truist's business decisions\nbased on information incorporating model\noutput would be adversely affected due to the\ninadequacy of that information. Also,\ninformation Truist provides to the public or\nto its regulators based on poorly designed or\nimplemented models could be inaccurate or\nmisleading. Some of the decisions that the\nregulators make, including those related to\ncapital distributions to Truist's\nshareholders, could be adversely affected due\nto the perception that the quality of the\nmodels used to generate the relevant\ninformation is insufficient.\n\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses\nfrom fraud.\n\nCriminals committing fraud increasingly are\nusing more sophisticated techniques and in\nsome cases, are a part of larger criminal\norganizations, which allow them to be more\neffective. Fraudulent activity has taken many\nforms and escalates as more tools for\naccessing financial services emerge, such as\nreal-time payments. Fraud schemes are broad\nand continuously evolving and include such\nthings as debit card/credit card fraud, check\nfraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM\nmachines, social engineering and phishing\nattacks to obtain personal information or\nimpersonation of the Company's clients through\nthe use of falsified or stolen credentials.\n\nIn addition, individuals or business entities\nmay properly identify themselves, yet seek to\nestablish a business relationship for the\npurpose of perpetrating fraud. Increased\ndeployment of technologies, such as chip card\ntechnology, defray and reduce aspects of\nfraud; however, criminals are turning to other\nsources to steal personally identifiable\ninformation, such as unaffiliated healthcare\nproviders and government entities, in order to\nimpersonate the consumer to commit fraud.\nFurther, as a result of the increased\nsophistication of fraud activity, the Company\nhas increased spending on systems, resources\nand controls to detect and prevent fraud, as\nwell as increased spending to provide certain\ncredit monitoring and identity theft\nprotection services to the Company's consumer\nclients. This will result in continued ongoing\ninvestments in the future.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 33\nThe Company's operational or security systems\nor infrastructure or those of third parties,\ncould fail or be breached, which could disrupt\nthe Company's business and adversely impact\nthe Company's results of operations, liquidity\nand financial condition, as well as cause\nlegal or reputational harm.\n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure\nexists throughout the Company's business and,\nas a result of the Company's interactions with\nand reliance on third parties, is not limited\nto the Company's own internal operational\nfunctions. The Company's operational and\nsecurity systems and infrastructure, including\ncomputer systems, data management and internal\nprocesses, as well as those of third parties,\nare integral to the Company's performance.\nTruist teammates and third parties may expose\nthe Company to risk as a result of human\nerror, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure\nor breach of systems and infrastructure. For\nexample, the Company's ability to conduct\nbusiness may be adversely affected by any\nsignificant disruptions, including to third\nparties with whom the Company interacts with\nor relies upon.\n\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents could have a material adverse impact on\nthe Company\u2019s operations or the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results.\n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic weather events\nor pandemics could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition or results of\noperations. Truist has significant operations\nand clients along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts\nas well as other regions of the U.S., which\ncould be adversely impacted by hurricanes,\ntornadoes and other severe weather in those\nareas. Truist\u2019s clients could also be\ndisrupted by the physical effects of climate\nchange, which may become more frequent and\nintense. Natural and other types of disasters,\nincluding as a result of climate change, could\nhave an adverse impact on Truist's businesses\nin that such events could materially disrupt\nthe Company\u2019s operations or the ability or\nwillingness of the Company\u2019s clients to access\nthe financial services offered, including\nadverse impacts on the Company\u2019s borrowers to\ntimely repay their loans and the value of any\ncollateral held. These events could reduce the\nCompany\u2019s earnings and cause volatility in the\nCompany\u2019s financial results for any fiscal\nquarter or year and have a material adverse\neffect on the Company\u2019s financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\nAlthough Truist has business continuity plans\nand other safeguards in place, the Company\u2019s\noperations and communications may be adversely\naffected by natural disasters or other\ncatastrophic events and there can be no\nassurance that such business continuity plans\nwill be effective.\n\nTruist may be impacted by the soundness of\nother financial institutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine\nfunding transactions could be adversely\naffected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are\ninterrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. Truist\nhas exposure to many different industries and\ncounterparties and routinely executes\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial industry, including brokers and\ndealers, central counterparties, commercial\nbanks, investment banks, mutual and hedge\nfunds and other institutional investors and\nclients. As a result, defaults by, or even\nrumors or questions about, one or more\nfinancial services institutions or the\nfinancial services industry generally, in the\npast have led to market-wide liquidity\nproblems and could lead to losses or defaults\nby Truist or by other institutions. Many of\nthese transactions expose the Company to\ncredit risk in the event of default of the\nCompany\u2019s counterparty or client. In addition,\nthe Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated\nwhen the collateral held by Truist cannot be\nliquidated or is liquidated at prices not\nsufficient to recover the full amount of the\nCompany\u2019s exposure. Any such losses could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n\nTruist depends on the accuracy and\ncompleteness of information about clients and\ncounterparties.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist relies on the\ncompleteness and accuracy of representations\nmade by and information furnished by or on\nbehalf of clients and counterparties,\nincluding financial statements and other\nfinancial information. If the information\nprovided is not accurate or complete, the\nCompany\u2019s decisions about extending credit or\nentering into other transactions with clients\nor counterparties could be adversely affected\nand the Company could suffer defaults, credit\nlosses or other negative consequences as a\nresult.\n\nThe Company's accounting policies and\nprocesses are critical to how it reports the\nCompany's financial condition and results of\noperations. They require management to make\nestimates about matters that are uncertain.\n\nAccounting policies and processes are\nfundamental to how the Company records and\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require the\nuse of estimates and assumptions that may\naffect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or\nliabilities and financial results. Several of\nthe Company\u2019s accounting policies are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective and complex judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain\nand because it is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported under\ndifferent conditions or using different\nassumptions. If assumptions or estimates\nunderlying the Company\u2019s financial statements\nare incorrect or are adjusted periodically,\nthe Company may experience material losses.\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nManagement has identified certain accounting\npolicies as being critical because they\nrequire management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the\nvaluations of assets, liabilities, commitments\nand contingencies. A variety of factors could\naffect the realization of income and expense\nor the recognition of assets and liabilities\nin the Company's financial statements. Truist\nhas established detailed policies and control\nprocedures that are intended to ensure these\ncritical accounting estimates and judgments\nare well controlled and applied consistently.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for\nchanging methodologies occurs in an\nappropriate manner. Due to the uncertainty\nsurrounding the Company\u2019s judgments and the\nestimates pertaining to these matters, the\nCompany cannot guarantee that adjustments to\naccounting policies or restatement of prior\nperiod financial statements will not be\nrequired.\n\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC\nchange the financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that govern the preparation of the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements. In addition,\naccounting standard setters and those who\ninterpret the accounting standards may change\nor even reverse their previous interpretations\nor positions on how these standards should be\napplied. Changes in financial accounting and\nreporting standards and changes in current\ninterpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol, can be hard to predict and could\nmaterially affect how the Company reports its\nfinancial results and condition. In some\ncases, the Company could be required to apply\na new or revised standard retroactively,\nresulting in the restatement of prior period\nfinancial statements.\n\nDepressed market values for the Company's\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company's goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is periodically tested for impairment\nby comparing the fair value of each reporting\nunit to its carrying amount. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. The fair value of a reporting unit\nis impacted by the reporting unit\u2019s expected\nfinancial performance and susceptibility to\nadverse economic, regulatory and legislative\nchanges. Future adverse changes in economic\nconditions or expected financial performance\nmay cause the fair value of a reporting unit\nto be below its carrying amount, resulting in\ngoodwill impairment. The estimated fair values\nof the individual reporting units are assessed\nfor reasonableness by reviewing a variety of\nindicators, including comparing these\nestimated fair values to the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime. While this comparison provides some\nrelative market information about the\nestimated fair value of the reporting units,\nit is not determinative and needs to be\nevaluated in the context of the current\neconomic environment. However, significant and\nsustained declines in the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization could be an indication of\npotential goodwill impairment. Refer to the\n\"Critical Accounting Policies\" section for\nadditional details related to the Company\u2019s\nintangible assets policy.\n\nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of\nthe Company's articles of incorporation may\nhave an anti-takeover effect.\n\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including\nregulatory approval requirements, could make\nit difficult for a third party to acquire the\nCompany, even if doing so would be perceived\nto be beneficial to the Company\u2019s owners.\nAcquisition of certain amounts of any class of\nvoting stock of a BHC or depository\ninstitution, including shares of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock, may create a rebuttable\npresumption that the acquirer \"controls\" the\nBHC or depository institution and thus, unless\nthe acquirer is able to rebut this\npresumption, it would be subject to various\nlaws and regulations applicable to a BHC.\nAlso, a BHC must obtain the prior approval of\nthe FRB before, among other things, acquiring\ndirect or indirect ownership or control of\nmore than 5% of the voting shares of any bank,\nincluding Truist Bank.\n\nThere also are provisions in the Company\u2019s\namended and restated articles of incorporation\nand amended and restated bylaws, such as\nlimitations on the ability to call a special\nmeeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders, that\nmay be used to delay or block a takeover\nattempt. In addition, the Company\u2019s Board will\nbe authorized under the Company\u2019s amended and\nrestated articles of incorporation to issue\nshares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock and to\ndetermine the rights, terms, conditions and\nprivileges of such preferred stock, without\nshareholder approval. These provisions may\neffectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or\nother business combination.\n                                              \n  Technology Risks                            \n                                              \nThe Company faces cybersecurity risks,\nincluding denial of service, hacking and\nsocial engineering attacks that could result\nin the disclosure of confidential information,\nadversely affect the Company's operations or\nreputation and create significant legal and\nfinancial exposure.\n\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network\ninfrastructure and those of third parties are\nfrequently targeted in cyber-attacks, such as\ndenial of service attacks, hacking, malware\nintrusion, data corruption attempts, terrorist\nactivities or identity theft. The Company\u2019s\nbusiness relies on the secure processing,\ntransmission, storage and retrieval of\nconfidential, proprietary and other\ninformation in the Company\u2019s information\nsystems and that of third parties. In\naddition, to access the Company\u2019s network,\nproducts and services, the Company\u2019s clients\nand other third parties may use personal\nmobile devices or computing devices that are\noutside of the Company\u2019s network environment\nand can introduce added cybersecurity risks.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\nTruist and Truist\u2019s clients, regulators and\nother third parties, including other financial\nservices institutions and companies engaged in\ndata processing, have been subject to and are\nlikely to continue to be the target of, cyber-\nattacks. Cyber-attacks may expose security\nvulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or\nthe systems of third parties or other security\nmeasures that could result in the unauthorized\ngathering, monitoring, misuse, release, loss\nor destruction of confidential, proprietary or\nsensitive information. A cyber-attack could\nalso damage the Company\u2019s systems by\nintroducing material disruptions to the\nCompany\u2019s or the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or other\nthird parties\u2019 network access or business\noperations. As cyber threats continue to\nevolve, the Company may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to continue\nto modify or enhance the Company\u2019s protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate any\ninformation security vulnerabilities or\nincidents. Despite efforts to ensure the\nintegrity of the Company\u2019s systems and\nimplement controls, processes, policies and\nother protective measures, the Company may not\nbe able to anticipate all security breaches,\nnor may the Company be able to implement\nsufficient preventive measures against such\nsecurity breaches, which may result in\nmaterial losses or consequences to Truist.\n\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions\nhave significantly increased in recent years\nin part because of the proliferation of new\ntechnologies to facilitate and conduct\nfinancial transactions. For example,\ncybersecurity risks may increase in the future\nas Truist continues to expand its mobile-\npayment and internet-based product offerings\nand expand the Company\u2019s internal usage of\nweb-based products and applications. In\naddition, cybersecurity risks have\nsignificantly increased in recent years in\npart due to the increased sophistication and\nactivities of organized crime affiliates,\nterrorist organizations, hostile foreign\ngovernments, disgruntled teammates or vendors,\nactivists and other external parties,\nincluding those involved in corporate\nespionage. Even the most advanced internal\ncontrol environment may be vulnerable to\ncompromise. Persistent attackers may succeed\nin penetrating defenses given enough\nresources, time and motive. The techniques\nused by cyber criminals change frequently, and\nmay not be recognized until launched or well\nafter a breach has occurred. In addition, the\nexistence of cyber-attacks or security\nbreaches at third party vendors with access to\nthe Company\u2019s data may not be disclosed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nThe Company also faces indirect technology,\ncybersecurity and other operational risks\nrelating to clients and other third parties\nthat the Company relies upon to facilitate or\nenable business activities, including,\nfinancial counterparties, regulators and\nproviders of critical infrastructure such as\ninternet access and electrical power. In\naddition, Truist faces cybersecurity and other\noperational risks relating to the Merger,\nincluding increased phishing attacks on\nteammates, increased network perimeter\nscanning by attackers searching for\nvulnerabilities and domain name squatting.\nFurther, as a result of increasing\nconsolidation, interdependence and complexity\nof financial entities and technology systems,\na technology failure, cyber-attack or other\ninformation or security breach that\nsignificantly degrades, deletes, or\ncompromises the systems or data of one or more\nfinancial entities could have a material\nimpact on counterparties or other market\nparticipants. This consolidation,\ninterconnectivity and complexity increases the\nrisk of operational failure, on both\nindividual and industry-wide bases, as\ndisparate systems need to be integrated, often\non an accelerated basis. Any third party\ntechnology failure, cyber-attack, other\ninformation or security breach, termination,\nor constraint could, among other things,\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to\nconduct transactions, service the Company\u2019s\nclients, manage the Company\u2019s exposure to risk\nor expand the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe public perception that a cyber-attack on\nthe Company\u2019s systems has been successful,\nwhether or not this perception is correct, may\ndamage the Company\u2019s reputation with clients\nand third parties with whom the Company does\nbusiness. Hacking of personal information and\nidentity theft risks, in particular, could\ncause serious reputational harm. A successful\npenetration or circumvention of system\nsecurity could cause serious negative\nconsequences, including loss of clients and\nbusiness opportunities; costs associated with\nmaintaining business relationships after an\nattack or breach; significant disruption to\nthe Company\u2019s operations and business;\nmisappropriation, exposure or destruction of\nthe Company\u2019s confidential information,\nintellectual property, funds and those of the\nCompany\u2019s clients; or damage to the Company\u2019s\nor the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or third parties\u2019\ncomputers or systems and could result in a\nviolation of applicable privacy laws and other\nlaws. This could result in litigation\nexposure, regulatory fines, penalties, loss of\nconfidence in the Company\u2019s security measures,\nreputational damage, reimbursement or other\ncompensatory costs, additional compliance\ncosts, which could adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and\nfinancial condition. In addition, the Company\nmay not have adequate insurance coverage to\ncompensate for losses from a cybersecurity\nevent.\n\nTruist will continually encounter\ntechnological change and must effectively\ndevelop and implement new technology.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing\nrapid technological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services. Truist has invested in\ntechnology and connectivity to automate\nfunctions previously performed manually, to\nfacilitate the ability of clients to engage in\nfinancial transactions and otherwise to\nenhance the client experience with respect to\nthe Company\u2019s products and services. Truist\nexpects to make additional investments in\ninnovation and technology to address\ntechnological disruption in the industry and\nimprove client offerings and service. These\nchanges allow the Company to better serve the\nCompany\u2019s clients and to reduce costs.\n\n36 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in\npart, upon the Company\u2019s ability to address\nclients\u2019 needs by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that satisfy client\ndemands, including demands for faster and more\nsecure payment services, to create\nefficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations and\nto integrate those offerings with legacy\nplatforms or to update those legacy platforms.\nA failure to maintain or enhance the Company\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because of a failure to\nanticipate client expectations, a failure in\nthe performance of technological developments\nor an untimely roll out of developments, may\ncause the Company to lose market share or\nincur additional expense.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

During 2020, the Company had\nno common stock repurchases, except shares\nexchanged or surrendered in connection with\nthe exercise of equity-based awards under\nequity-based compensation plans.\n\nIn December 2020, Truist announced that its\nBoard of Directors had authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the\nCompany's common stock, beginning in the first\nquarter of 2021, consistent with recent FRB\ncapital restriction guidance, to optimize\nTruist's capital position.\n                                              \n  Ta\u2026                                         \n  6:                                          \n  Sh\u2026                                  Maxi\u2026  \n  Re\u2026                                  Rema\u2026  \n  Ac\u2026                                  Doll\u2026  \n  (D\u2026                                  Value  \n  in                                      of  \n  mi\u2026                                  Shar\u2026  \n  ex\u2026                       Tot\u2026       Avai\u2026  \n  per               Ave\u2026    Sha\u2026         for  \n  sh\u2026               Pri\u2026    Rep\u2026       Repu\u2026  \n  da\u2026    Tot\u2026       Paid    Pur\u2026       Purs\u2026  \n  sh\u2026    Sha\u2026        Per    to            to  \n  in     Rep\u2026       Sha\u2026    Pub\u2026       Publ\u2026  \n  th\u2026     (1)        (2)    Plan        Plan  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  No\u2026       4    $  43.\u2026    \u2014       $      \u2014  \n  20\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026       \u2014       47.\u2026    \u2014          2,000  \n  20\u2026                                         \n  To\u2026       4       43.\u2026    \u2014                 \n                                              \n(1) Includes shares exchanged or surrendered\nin connection with the exercise of equity-\nbased awards under equity-based compensation\nplans.\n\n(2) Excludes commissions.\n\n38 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Preferred Stock                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Issuances                                   \n                                              \nDuring 2020, Truist issued $3.5 billion in\nseries O, series P, series Q and series R\npreferred stock, gross of issuance cost, to\nfurther strengthen its capital position.\nDuring 2019, the Company issued $1.7 billion\nof series N non-cumulative perpetual preferred\nstock.\n\nUpon closing of the Merger, each outstanding\nshare of SunTrust perpetual preferred stock\nwas converted into the right to receive one\nshare of an applicable newly issued series of\nTruist preferred stock having substantially\nthe same terms as such share of SunTrust\npreferred stock. The Company issued series I,\nJ, K, L and M non-cumulative perpetual\npreferred stock with a total par and fair\nvalue of $2.0 billion on the Merger closing\ndate.\n                                              \n  Redemptions                                 \n                                              \nEarly in 2021, the Company announced the\nforthcoming redemption of all 18,000\noutstanding shares of its perpetual preferred\nstock series F and the corresponding\ndepositary shares representing fractional\ninterests in such series for $450 million and\nall 20,000 outstanding shares of its perpetual\npreferred stock series G and the corresponding\ndepositary shares representing fractional\ninterests in such series for $500 million.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company redeemed all 5,000\noutstanding shares of its perpetual preferred\nstock series K and the corresponding\ndepositary shares representing fractional\ninterests in such series for $500 million plus\nany unpaid dividends.

Each\nsuch converted Company equity award will\ncontinue to be subject to the same terms and\nconditions as applied to the corresponding\nheritage SunTrust equity award, except that,\nin the case of heritage SunTrust performance\nstock unit awards, the number of shares\nunderlying the converted Company equity award\nwas determined based on actual performance\nthrough September 30, 2019 and target\nperformance for the balance of the applicable\nperformance period and such award will\ncontinue to vest after the Merger solely based\non continued service.

Below is an overview on progress in\na few key areas.\n\nIntegration Efforts\n\nTruist completed the Merger on December 6,\n2019, and made significant progress on\nintegration and conversion efforts in 2020.\nSome milestones include unveiling Truist\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values; launching the\nTruist brand and visual identity; completing\nthe purchase of Truist Center, the new\ncorporate headquarters in Charlotte, NC;\nlaunching Truist social media platforms;\nannouncing brand conversions for several\nbusiness units including Truist Insurance,\nTruist Securities, and Truist Leadership\nInstitute; launching Truist Foundation and\nTruist Ventures; beginning early migrations\nfor the mortgage business; and introducing the\nblended branch program.

Truist is actively\nhelping clients impacted by COVID-19,\nproviding payment relief assistance for credit\ncards, personal loans, auto loans, home equity\nlines of credit, and residential mortgages.\nTruist was one of the largest lenders of PPP\nloans in 2020 and remains committed to helping\nsmall businesses get access to emergency funds\nfor first and second-draw PPP loans.

The carrying value of\nPPP loans was $11.0 billion as of December 31,\n2020.\n\nSupporting Teammates\n\nThrough the challenges faced, Truist\u2019s concern\nfor teammates and their families remains a top\npriority. Truist provided over $100 million in\nspecial COVID-19 support to teammates,\nincluding bonuses, special reimbursement for\nchildcare and an increase in emergency child-\nand elder-care benefits, enhanced onsite pay,\nand steps to enhance wellness and family\nsupport. Truist released its first Corporate\nSocial Responsibility report, which included a\ncommitment to increasing the number of\nracially and ethnically diverse teammates\namong senior leadership positions from\napproximately 12% to at least 15%. Truist is\nalso committed to ensuring regular, ongoing\npay equity reviews for teammates. On the topic\nof racial inequity, Truist hosted more than\n260 \"Days of Understanding\" sessions designed\nto encourage bold dialogue on real world\ntopics in an open, trusting environment. The\nCompany also rolled out enhanced unconscious\nbias training for teammates and Executive\nLeadership.\n\nSupporting Communities\n\nIn response to COVID-19 in 2020, the Company\nlaunched Truist Cares, providing a total of\n$50 million in philanthropic support to aid\ncharities meeting basic needs, furnishing\nmedical supplies and addressing financial\nhardships across the nation, and have provided\na total of 355 grants to community partners.\n\nTruist is committed to addressing racial and\nsocial inequity and has taken a number of\nactions to expand efforts towards advancing\nequity, economic empowerment and education for\nclients, communities and teammates.\n\n42 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn 2020, Truist provided $78 million to\nsupport historically underrepresented\ncommunities, including a $40 million initial\ndonation to help establish CornerSquare\nCommunity Capital made through the Truist\nFoundation, Inc. and the Truist Charitable\nFund, and approximately $20 million over three\nyears to develop and strengthen partnerships,\nprograms, and scholarships that benefit\nhistorically black colleges and universities\nand their students. The Company increased\nfinancial resources for low- and moderate-\nincome communities through a $60 billion\nCommunity Benefits Plan from 2020-2022 to\nsupport home ownership, small business growth\nand community revitalization.\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet income available to common shareholders\ntotaled $4.2 billion for 2020, a 38.2%\nincrease from the prior year. On a diluted per\ncommon share basis, earnings for 2020 were\n$3.08, compared to $3.71 for 2019. Truist's\nresults of operations for 2020 produced a\nreturn on average assets of 0.90% and a return\non average common shareholders' equity of\n6.82% compared to prior year ratios of 1.31%\nand 9.87%, respectively. Results include\nmerger-related and restructuring charges of\n$860 million ($660 million after-tax) for 2020\ncompared to $360 million ($285 million after-\ntax) for 2019, and incremental operating\nexpenses related to the Merger of $534 million\n($409 million after-tax) for 2020 compared to\n$164 million ($127 million after-tax) for\n2019. Additionally, the 2020 results include a\nloss on extinguishment of debt of $235 million\n($180 million after-tax) and charitable\ncontributions of $50 million ($38 million\nafter-tax), offset by securities gains of $402\nmillion ($308 million after-tax). The 2019\nresults include securities losses of $116\nmillion ($90 million after-tax), a reduction\nin net income available to common shareholders\nof $46 million arising from the redemption of\npreferred stock, partially offset by a $14\nmillion after-tax net gain from the sale of\nresidential mortgage loans.\n\nTruist's revenue for 2020 was $22.7 billion.\nOn a TE basis, revenue was $22.8 billion,\nwhich represents an increase of $10.2 billion\ncompared to 2019. Net interest income on a TE\nbasis was $14.0 billion, an increase of $6.5\nbillion compared to the prior year, which\nreflects a $6.2 billion increase in interest\nincome and a $374 million decrease in interest\nexpense. The increase in net interest income\nwas due primarily to a $152.9 billion increase\nin average outstanding loans, a $32.6 billion\nincrease in average securities, partially\noffset by a 78 basis point decrease in earning\nasset yields.\n\nNIM was 3.22% for 2020, down 20 basis points\ncompared to the prior year. Average earning\nassets increased $217.2 billion or 100.4%,\nwhile average interest-bearing liabilities\nincreased $153.7 billion or 101.8%, and\nnoninterest-bearing deposits increased $59.1\nbillion or 106.4%. The TE yield on the total\nloan portfolio for 2020 was 4.33%, down 66\nbasis points compared to the prior year. The\nTE yield on the average securities portfolio\nwas 2.09%, down 53 basis points compared to\nthe prior year. The average cost of interest-\nbearing deposits was 0.32%, down 61 basis\npoints compared to the prior year. The average\ncost of total deposits was 0.22%, down 42\nbasis points compared to the prior year.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.3\nbillion, compared to $615 million for the\nprior year. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion,\ncompared to $634 million for the prior year.\nAsset quality ratios were relatively stable at\nDecember 31, 2020 compared to the prior year,\nreflecting diversification benefits of the\nMerger and effective problem asset resolution.\nThe ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs was\n5.21X for 2020, compared to 2.44X in 2019,\nreflecting the CECL adoption build, as well as\na reserve build in 2020 in connection with\nCOVID-19 and the economic downturn. NPAs\nincreased $703 million year over year,\nprimarily due to PCI loans that would have\nbeen classified as nonperforming at December\n31, 2019 and loans exiting certain\naccommodation programs related to the CARES\nAct.\n\nNoninterest income increased $3.6 billion for\nthe year with nearly all categories of\nnoninterest income being impacted by the\nMerger. Additional increases in noninterest\nincome were primarily due to higher insurance\nincome driven by improved production levels\nand acquisitions. Noninterest expense\nincreased $7.0 billion for the year. Excluding\nmerger-related and restructuring charges,\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger, the loss on extinguishment of debt,\ncharitable contribution and the impact of an\nincrease of $521 million of amortization\nexpense for intangibles, noninterest expense\nincreased $5.3 billion, primarily reflecting\nthe impact of the Merger.\n\nTruist's total assets at December 31, 2020\nwere $509.2 billion, an increase of $36.2\nbillion compared to December 31, 2019,\nreflecting a $46.1 billion increase in AFS\nsecurities, partially offset by an increase in\nALLL of $4.3 billion, a decrease in LHFS of\n$2.3 billion and a decrease in other assets of\n$1.2 billion.\n\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2020 were\n$438.3 billion, an increase of $31.8 billion\nfrom the prior year, reflecting an increase of\n$46.4 billion in deposits, partially offset by\na decrease of $12.1 billion in short-term\nborrowings. During 2020, the Company also\nissued $6.5 billion of senior and subordinated\nlong-term debt.\n\nTotal shareholders' equity was $70.9 billion\nat December 31, 2020, up $4.4 billion compared\nto the prior year. The increase is due to net\nincome in excess of dividends paid of $1.8\nbillion and OCI of $1.6 billion. During 2020,\nTruist issued $3.5 billion in preferred stock,\ngross of issuance costs, to further strengthen\nits capital position and redeemed $500 million\nof series K preferred stock. The increases in\nshareholders equity were partially offset by a\n$2.1 billion cumulative effect adjustment\nrelated to the adoption of CECL.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 43\nTruist maintained strong capital and liquidity\nin 2020.

During this\nprocess, management considers the current\nfinancial condition and performance of the\nCompany and its expectations for future\neconomic activity from both a national and\nlocal market perspective. Achieving key\nstrategic objectives and established long-term\nfinancial goals is subject to many\nuncertainties and challenges. In the opinion\nof management, the following challenges are\nthe most likely to impact Truist\u2019s near to\nmedium term performance:\n\n\u2022 Activating the Company\u2019s culture of striving\nto make life better for clients, teammates and\nstakeholders;\n\n\u2022 Achieving the benefits from the Merger,\nincluding anticipated synergies and cost\nsavings;\n\n\u2022 Managing the integration of systems and\noperations, while safeguarding the Company\nagainst external threats;\n\n\u2022 Executing the Company\u2019s \"T3 strategy\" by\nfocusing on personal touch and technology to\nengender trust and provide distinctive, secure\nand successful client experiences;\n\n\u2022 Driving innovation and remaining attuned to\nevolving client preferences to succeed in an\nintensely competitive environment;\n\n\u2022 Onboarding and retaining key personnel while\nmaintaining safety protocols to protect\nclients, teammates and communities; and\n\n\u2022 Navigating economic risks and actively\nmanaging credit exposures impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition, certain other challenges and\nunforeseen events could have a near term\nimpact on Truist's financial condition and\nresults of operations.

Average\nearning assets increased $217.2 billion, which\nprimarily reflects a $152.9 billion increase\nin average total loans and leases, a $32.6\nbillion increase in average securities, a\n$28.4 billion increase in average other\nearning assets and a $3.4 billion increase in\ninterest earning trading assets. Average\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased $153.7\nbillion. Average interest-bearing deposits\nincreased $131.0 billion, average long-term\ndebt increased $21.0 billion and average\nshort-term borrowings increased $1.7 billion.\nThe significant increases in earnings assets\nand liabilities are primarily due to the\nMerger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19\npandemic and the resulting government stimulus\nprograms.\n\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 was 4.33%, down\n66 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod, reflecting the impact of rate\ndecreases and deferred interest for loans\ngranted an accommodation in connection with\nCOVID-19, partially offset by purchase\naccounting accretion from merged loans. The\nyield on the average securities portfolio for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.09%,\ndown 53 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod primarily due to lower yields on new\npurchases and higher premium amortization. The\naverage cost of total deposits was 0.22%, down\n42 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod. The average cost of interest-bearing\ndeposits was 0.32%, down 61 basis points\ncompared to the earlier period. The average\nrate on short-term borrowings was 1.35%, down\n99 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod. The average rate on long-term debt was\n1.75%, down 147 basis points compared to the\nearlier period. The lower rates on interest-\nbearing liabilities reflect the lower rate\nenvironment. The lower rates on long-term debt\nalso reflect the amortization of the fair\nvalue mark on the assumed debt and the\nissuance of new long-term debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt\nwere $2.4 billion, $19 million and $216\nmillion, respectively. The remaining\nunamortized fair value mark on loans and\nleases consists of $1.1 billion for commercial\nloans and leases and $1.3 billion for consumer\nloans and leases. These amounts will be\nrecognized over the remaining contractual\nlives of the underlying instruments or as\npaydowns occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n\n44 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

This was primarily related to\nadditional on-site pay and bonuses for certain\nteammates, net occupancy costs for enhanced\ncleaning and teammate support expenses.\nAdditionally, personnel expenses increased as\na result of the completion of a post-Merger\nreevaluation of job grades that resulted in\nadditional salaries, incentives and equity-\nbased compensation expenses.\n\nMerger-Related and Restructuring Charges\n\nTruist has incurred certain merger-related and\nrestructuring charges, which include:\n\n\u2022 severance and personnel-related costs or\ncredits;\n\n\u2022 occupancy and equipment charges or credits,\nwhich relate to costs or gains associated with\nlease terminations, obsolete equipment write-\noffs and the sale of duplicate facilities and\nequipment;\n\n\u2022 professional services, which relate to legal\nand investment banking advisory fees and other\nconsulting services pertaining to\nrestructuring initiatives or transactions;\n\n\u2022 systems conversion and related charges,\nwhich represent costs to integrate the\nentity's information technology systems;\n\n\u2022 other merger-related and restructuring\ncharges or credits, which include expenses\nnecessary to convert and combine the acquired\nbranches and operations of merged companies,\ndirect media advertising related to the\nmergers and acquisitions, asset and supply\ninventory write-offs, and other similar\ncharges; and\n\n\u2022 write-offs related to exiting certain\nbusinesses.\n\nMerger-related and restructuring accruals are\nestablished when the costs are incurred or\nonce all requirements for a plan to dispose of\nor outsource certain business functions have\nbeen approved by management.

The\nremaining accruals at December 31, 2020 are\ngenerally expected to be utilized within one\nyear, unless they relate to specific contracts\nthat expire later.\n\nThe 2020 merger-related and restructuring\ncosts primarily reflect higher charges as a\nresult of the Merger, including costs for\nseverance and other benefits and costs related\nto exiting facilities, while the 2019 costs\nprimarily reflect branch closures and other\nrestructuring initiatives.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\nThe following table presents a summary of\nmerger-related and restructuring charges and\nthe related accruals:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n(1) The Company recognized $825 million and\n$298 million for the year ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the\nMerger.

The expected life\nof MBS will differ from contractual maturities\nbecause borrowers may have the right to call\nor prepay the underlying mortgage loans.\n                                              \n  Lending Activities                          \n                                              \nTruist strives to meet the credit needs of its\nclients while pursuing a balanced strategy of\nloan profitability, loan growth and loan\nquality. Management believes that this purpose\ncan best be accomplished by building strong\nclient relationships over time and developing\nin-depth local market knowledge. The Company\nemploys strict underwriting criteria governing\nthe degree of risk assumed and the diversity\nof the loan portfolio in terms of type,\nindustry and geographical concentration.\n\nTruist lends to a diverse client base that is\ngeographically dispersed to mitigate\nconcentration risk arising from local and\nregional economic downturns. International\nloans were immaterial as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019. The following discussion provides\nadditional information on the Company's loan\nand lease portfolios. Refer to the \"Risk\nManagement\" section for a discussion of the\ncredit risk management policies used to manage\nthe portfolios.\n\nCommercial Loan and Lease Portfolio\n\nCommercial loans and leases represent the\nlargest category of the Company's loan and\nlease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking\ngenerally targets small-to-middle market\nbusinesses with annual sales between $2\nmillion and $500 million, while CIB provides\nlending solutions to large commercial clients.\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio\nconsists of lending to public and private\nbusiness clients and is composed of commercial\nand industrial, owner occupied, equipment\nleasing and financing and commercial real\nestate, as well as government and\ninstitutional financing.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\nIn accordance with the Company's lending\npolicy, each commercial loan undergoes a\ndetailed underwriting process. Commercial\nloans are typically priced with an interest\nrate tied to market indices, such as the prime\nrate, LIBOR, or SOFR and are individually\nmonitored and reviewed for deterioration in\nthe ability of the client to repay the loan.\nThe majority of Truist's commercial loans are\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories and other types of collateral.\n\nResidential Mortgage Loan Portfolio\n\nTruist Bank offers various types of fixed and\nadjustable-rate loans for the purpose of\nconstructing, purchasing or refinancing\nresidential properties. Truist primarily\noriginates conforming mortgage loans and\nhigher quality jumbo and construction-to-\npermanent loans for owner-occupied properties.\nConforming loans are loans that are\nunderwritten in accordance with the\nunderwriting standards set forth by FNMA and\nFHLMC. They are generally collateralized by\none-to-four-family residential real estate,\ntypically have loan-to-collateral value ratios\nof 80% or less at origination, or have\nmortgage insurance as required by investors\nand are made to borrowers in good credit\nstanding.\n\nRisks associated with mortgage lending include\ninterest rate risk, which is mitigated through\nthe sale of a substantial portion of\nconforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary\nmortgage market and an effective MSR hedging\nprocess. Credit risk is managed through\nrigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage\ninsurance. The right to service the loans and\nreceive servicing income is generally retained\nwhen conforming loans are sold. Management\nbelieves that the retention of mortgage\nservicing is a relationship driver in retail\nbanking and a part of management's strategy to\nestablish long-term client relationships and\noffer high quality client service. Truist also\npurchases residential mortgage loans from\ncorrespondent originators. The loans purchased\nfrom third party originators are subject to\nsubstantially the same underwriting and risk-\nmanagement criteria as loans originated\ninternally.\n\nResidential Home Equity and Direct Loan\nPortfolio\n\nThe residential home equity and direct loan\nportfolio is composed of a wide variety of\nsecured and unsecured loans offered through\nTruist\u2019s branch network, as well as loans\noriginated by LightStream, Truist\u2019s national\nonline consumer lending division. Loans\noriginated through the Truist branch network\ninclude revolving home equity lines of credit\nsecured by first or second liens on\nresidential real estate and certain other\nsecured and unsecured lending marketed to\nqualifying clients and other creditworthy\ncandidates in Truist\u2019s market areas.\nLightStream provides fixed-rate, unsecured\nlending to consumers with strong credit\nthrough its proprietary online loan\norigination system.\n\nIndirect Auto Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect auto portfolio primarily includes\nsecured indirect installment loans to\nconsumers for the purchase of new and used\nautomobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also\nincludes nonprime and near prime automobile\nfinance. Such loans are originated through\napproved franchised and independent dealers\nthroughout the Truist market area and\nnationally through Regional Acceptance\nCorporation. These loans are relatively\nhomogeneous and no single loan is individually\nsignificant in terms of its size and potential\nrisk of loss. Indirect auto loans are subject\nto rigorous lending policies and procedures\nand are underwritten with note amounts and\ncredit limits that are consistent with the\nCompany's risk philosophy. In addition to its\nnormal underwriting due diligence, Truist uses\napplication systems and scoring systems to\nhelp underwrite and manage the credit risk in\nits indirect auto portfolio.\n\nIndirect Other Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect other portfolio includes secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used boats and\nrecreational vehicles. The indirect other\nportfolio also includes small ticket consumer\nlending related to the purchase of power\nsports equipment. These loans are relatively\nhomogeneous and no single loan is individually\nsignificant in terms of its size and potential\nrisk of loss. These loans are subject to\nsimilar rigorous lending policies and\nprocedures as the indirect auto loan\nportfolio. The indirect other loan portfolio\nalso includes other indirect lending to\nconsumers to finance home improvements,\nfurniture purchases, and certain elective\nhealth-care services. These loans are\noriginated in accordance with strict\nunderwriting criteria as determined by Truist.\n\nStudent Loan Portfolio\n\nThe student loan portfolio is composed of\ngovernment guaranteed student loans and\ncertain private student loans originated by\nthird parties. The government guarantee\nmitigates substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. Private\nstudent loans were purchased from third party\noriginators with credit enhancements that\npartially mitigate the Company\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\n52 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCredit Card Loan Portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio consists of the\noutstanding balances on credit cards. Truist\nmarkets credit cards to its existing client\nbase and does not solicit cardholders through\nnationwide programs or other forms of mass\nmarketing.

totaled $1.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020, up $703 million compared to\nDecember 31, 2019 primarily from the adoption\nof CECL, which resulted in the discontinuation\nof the pool-level accounting for PCI loans and\nreplaced that with a loan-level evaluation for\nnonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2019,\nthere was approximately $500 million of PCI\nloans that would have been classified as\nnonperforming had the Company evaluated\naccrual status on a loan level basis. The\nremaining increase in nonperforming loans held\nfor investment is primarily in commercial and\nindustrial loans and an increase in\nnonperforming mortgage loans due to loans\nexiting certain accommodation programs related\nto the CARES Act. Nonperforming loans and\nleases represented 0.44% of total loans and\nleases, up 26 basis points compared to\nDecember 31, 2019.\n\nPerforming TDRs were up $381 million compared\nto the prior year primarily in residential\nmortgage, lease financing and indirect auto\nloans. This increase primarily reflects the\napplication of acquisition accounting related\nto the Merger, which resulted in the removal\nof the TDR designation on all loans that were\nrestructured by SunTrust prior to the Merger\ndate.\n\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing totaled $2.0 billion at December 31,\n2020, relatively flat compared to the prior\nyear. In connection with the discontinuation\nof pool level accounting for PCI loans, loans\n90 days or more past due and still accruing\ndecreased as loan-level evaluations resulted\nin certain loans being placed in nonaccrual\nstatus. This decrease was partially offset by\nan increase in government guaranteed student\nloans. Additionally, residential mortgage\nloans 90 days or more past due increased\nprimarily due to the repurchase of delinquent\ngovernment guaranteed loans. The ratio of\nloans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing as a percentage of loans and leases\nwas 0.67% at December 31, 2020, an increase of\n1 basis point from the prior year. Excluding\ngovernment guaranteed and PCI loans, the ratio\nof loans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing as a percentage of loans and leases\nwas 0.04% at December 31, 2020, up 1 basis\npoint from December 31, 2019.\n\nLoans 30-89 days past due and still accruing\ntotaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020,\nrelatively flat compared to the prior year.\nLoans 30-89 days past due reflects a decrease\nin PCI loans, offset by a corresponding\nincrease in the portfolios where these loans\nwere transferred in connection with the\nimplementation of CECL. The ratio of loans\n30-89 days or more past due and still accruing\nas a percentage of loans and leases was 0.74%\nat December 31, 2020, flat compared to the\nprior year.\n\nProblem loans include NPLs and loans that are\n90 days or more past due and still accruing as\ndisclosed in Table 22.

As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on a loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES\nAct, Truist implemented loan modification\nprograms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nin order to provide borrowers with flexibility\nwith respect to repayment terms. Payment\nrelief assistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging\nprograms, along with certain other\nmodification strategies. The Company adopted\ncertain provisions of the CARES Act and other\nregulatory guidance that provide relief from\nthe requirement to apply TDR accounting to (1)\ncertain modifications of federally backed\nmortgages upon request from the borrower, and\n(2) certain modifications of other non-\nfederally backed mortgages for borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that were\nless than 30 days past due at December 31,\n2019.

The increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses was primarily due to the adoption of\nCECL. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a\n$3.1 billion increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses, including $2.8 billion that was\ncharged to retained earnings before tax, and\n$378 million related to the gross up for PCD\nloans. The remaining increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses primarily reflects\ndeteriorated economic conditions. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and\nlease losses was 1.95% of loans and leases\nheld for investment. The allowance for credit\nlosses includes $5.8 billion for loans and\nleases and $364 million for the reserve for\nunfunded commitments.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan\nand lease losses was 4.39 times nonperforming\nloans and leases held for investment, compared\nto 3.41 times at December 31, 2019. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and\nlease losses was 5.21 times annualized net\ncharge-offs, compared to 2.44 times at\nDecember 31, 2019.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNet charge-offs during 2020 totaled $1.1\nbillion, up $485 million compared to the prior\nyear. The increase in net charge-offs\nprimarily reflects the Merger. As a percentage\nof average loans and leases, annualized net\ncharge-offs were 0.36%, down four basis points\ncompared to the prior year. Current year net\ncharge-offs include $97 million of charge-offs\nrelated to the implementation of CECL, which\nrequired a gross-up of loan carrying values in\nconnection with the establishment of an\nallowance on PCD loans. Management performed a\ncomprehensive review of PCD assets during the\nyear and concluded in certain situations that\na charge-off was required. Excluding these\nadditional charge-offs, net charge-offs would\nhave been an annualized 0.33% of average loans\nand leases for 2020, down seven basis points\ncompared to the prior year.\n\nThe following table presents an allocation of\nthe ALLL.

Truist also\nreceives notification when the first lien\nholder, whether Truist or another financial\ninstitution, has initiated foreclosure\nproceedings against the borrower. When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nAs a result, using migration assumptions that\nare based on historical experience and\nadjusted for current trends, Truist estimates\nthe volume of second lien positions where the\nfirst lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL\nto reflect the increased risk of loss on these\ncredits. Finally, Truist also provides\nadditional reserves for second lien positions\nwhen the estimated combined current loan to\nvalue ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Truist held or serviced the\nfirst lien on 30.6% of its second lien\npositions.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 61\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of Other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 29: Other                             \n  Assets as of                                \n  Period End                                  \n  December 31,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)                2020         2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank-owned life     $   6,479    $   6,383  \n  insurance                                   \n  Tax credit and                              \n  other private           5,685        5,448  \n  equity                                      \n  investments                                 \n  Prepaid pension         4,358        3,579  \n  assets                                      \n  Derivative              3,837        2,053  \n  assets                                      \n  Accrued income          1,934        1,807  \n  Accounts                1,833        2,418  \n  receivable                                  \n  Leased assets                               \n  and related             1,810        1,897  \n  assets                                      \n  ROU assets              1,333        1,823  \n  Prepaid expenses        1,247        1,254  \n  Equity                                      \n  securities at           1,054          817  \n  fair value                                  \n  Structured real           390          987  \n  estate                                      \n  FHLB stock                164          764  \n  Other                     549        2,602  \n  Total other         $  30,673    $  31,832  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits are the primary source of funds for\nthe Company's lending and investing\nactivities.

Deposit\naccount terms vary with respect to the minimum\nbalance required, the time period the funds\nmust remain on deposit and service charge\nschedules. Interest rates paid on specific\ndeposit types are determined based on (i)\ncompetitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated\namount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the\navailability and cost of alternative sources\nof funding, and (iv) anticipated future\neconomic conditions and interest rates.\nDeposits are attractive sources of funding\nbecause of their stability and relative cost.\n\nThe following table presents deposits for each\nof the last five years:\n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       6\u2026       \u2026       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \nDeposits totaled $381.1 billion at December\n31, 2020, an increase of $46.4 billion from\nDecember 31, 2019.

short-term borrowings\ntotaled $6.1 billion, a decrease of $12.1\nbillion compared to December 31, 2019, due\nprimarily to a decrease of $10.8 billion in\nshort-term FHLB advances. These borrowing\nsources were replaced with deposit funding.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nAverage short-term borrowings were $10.1\nbillion, or 2.4% of total funding for 2020, as\ncompared to $8.5 billion, or 4.1% for the\nprior year. The increase in the average amount\nwas due to the Merger. Average short-term\nborrowings decreased as a percentage of\nfunding sources due to strong deposit growth.\n\nLong-term debt provides funding and, to a\nlesser extent, regulatory capital, and\nprimarily consists of senior and subordinated\nnotes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-\nterm debt totaled $39.6 billion at December\n31, 2020, a decrease of $1.7 billion compared\nto December 31, 2019. During 2020, the Company\nissued $4.8 billion of senior notes with\ninterest rates from 1.125% to 1.95% maturing\nin 2023 to 2030, $500 million in floating rate\nsenior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion\nof subordinated notes with an interest rate of\n2.25% maturing in 2030. These issuances were\npartially offset by the redemption of $4.6\nbillion of senior notes during 2020 and a\ndecrease of $3.3 billion in long-term FHLB\nadvances. FHLB advances represented 2.2% of\ntotal outstanding long-term debt at December\n31, 2020, compared to 10.0% at December 31,\n2019. The average cost of long-term debt was\n1.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020,\ndown 147 basis points compared to the same\nperiod in 2019. Truist entered into $20\nbillion of FHLB advances during 2020 to build\nliquidity and ensure the Company was able to\nmeet the funding needs of its clients. As\nmarket conditions stabilized and deposits\nincreased, these advances were repaid and the\nCompany recognized a loss of $235 million on\nthe early extinguishment of debt. The\nrepayment of these advances improved net\ninterest income, the net interest margin and\nthe leverage ratios.\n\nShareholders' Equity\n\nTotal shareholders' equity was $70.9 billion\nat December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.4\nbillion from December 31, 2019. This increase\nincludes the gross issuance of $3.5 billion of\npreferred stock during the year, $4.5 billion\nin net income available to common shareholders\nand an increase of $1.6 billion in AOCI, which\nwas partially offset by $2.1 billion related\nto the adoption of CECL and $2.7 billion for\ncommon and preferred dividends. In addition,\nTruist redeemed $500 million of its Series K\npreferred stock during 2020. Truist's book\nvalue per common share at December 31, 2020\nwas $46.52, compared to $45.66 at December 31,\n2019.\n\nRefer to \"Note 12.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\ntaxonomy that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk\nconversations and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces,\nboth presently and in the future, and the\nCompany\u2019s position on managing it to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate's adherence to, and successful\nimplementation of, Truist's risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany's compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the risks\nassociated with integrating heritage BB&T and\nheritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive\nLeadership oversee the change management\nprogram, which is designed to ensure key\ndecisions are reviewed and that there is\nappropriate oversight of integration\nactivities.\n\nTruist's purpose, mission and values are the\nfoundation for the risk management framework\nutilized at Truist and therefore serve as the\nbasis on which the risk appetite and risk\nstrategy are built. Truist's RMO provides\nindependent oversight and guidance for risk-\ntaking across the enterprise. In keeping with\nthe belief that consistent values drive long-\nterm behaviors, Truist's RMO has established\nthe following risk values which guide\nteammates\u2019 day-to-day activities:\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 Managing risk is the responsibility of every\nteammate.\n\n\u2022 Proactively identifying risk and managing\nthe inherent risks of their businesses is the\nresponsibility of the business units.\n\n\u2022 Managing risk with a balanced approach which\nincludes quality, profitability, and growth.\n\n\u2022 Measuring what is managed and managing what\nis measured.\n\n\u2022 Utilizing sound and consistent risk\nmanagement practices.\n\n\u2022 Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and\nqualitatively.\n\n\u2022 Realizing lower cost of capital from high\nquality risk management.\n\nTruist places significant emphasis on risk\nmanagement oversight and maintains a separate\nBoard-level Risk Committee, which assists the\nBoard in its oversight of the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement function. The Committee is\nresponsible for approving and periodically\nreviewing the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework and risk management policies as well\nas monitoring the Company\u2019s risk profile,\napproving risk appetite statements, and\nproviding input to management regarding\nTruist's risk appetite and risk profile.\n\nThe RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible\nfor overseeing the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring, management and\nreporting of risk. The CRO has direct access\nto the Board to communicate any risk issues\n(current or emerging) as well as the\nperformance of the risk management activities\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\nAs illustrated below, the risk management\nframework is supported by three lines of\ndefense. The following figure describes the\nroles of the three lines of defense:\n\nTruist\u2019s Risk Governance framework is designed\nto provide comprehensive Board and Executive\nLeadership risk oversight, maintaining a\ncommittee governance structure that is\ndesigned to ensure alignment and execution of\nthe risk management framework. The committee\nstructure provides a mechanism to allow for\nefficient aggregation and escalation of risk\ninformation from the BUs up to the risk\nprograms, Executive Leadership and ultimately\nthe Board.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\nThe executive level committees include the\nERC, ECRPMC, MRLCC, EBPCC, TMC and DC, each of\nwhich is chaired by a member of Executive\nLeadership. These committees provide oversight\nof each of the primary risk types.\n\nThe ERC establishes a fully integrated view of\nrisks across the company, provides broad\nstrategic oversight of all risk types, and\noversees corporate-wide strategies for\nidentifying, assessing, controlling,\nmeasuring, monitoring and reporting risk at\nthe enterprise level.\n\nThe ERC is responsible for maintaining an\neffective risk management framework and\nmonitoring its adoption and execution across\nthe enterprise. The ERC is chaired by the CRO\nand its membership includes all members of\nExecutive Leadership and the General Auditor.\n\nThe principal types of inherent risk include\nmarket, credit, liquidity, compliance,\nstrategic, reputational, operational and\ntechnology risks. The following is a\ndiscussion of these risks.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility or correlations among\nfinancial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist's strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist's most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk\nand volatility risk in Truist's BUs. Interest\nrate risk results from differences between the\ntiming of rate changes and the timing of cash\nflows associated with assets and liabilities\n(re-pricing risk); from changing rate\nrelationships among different yield curves\naffecting bank activities (basis risk); from\nchanging rate relationships across the\nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and\nfrom interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income and capital\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n\n66 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk both on its assets and\non its liabilities. Since interest rate\nchanges are out of the control of any private\nsector institution, Truist actively manages\nits interest rate risk exposure through the\nstrategic repricing of its assets and\nliabilities, taking into account the volumes,\nmaturities and mix, with the goal of keeping\nnet interest margin as stable as possible.\nTruist primarily uses three methods to measure\nand monitor its interest rate risk: (i)\nsimulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist's\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes and projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas are an important assumption in\nthe interest rate risk modeling process.\nTruist applies an average deposit beta (the\nsensitivity of deposit rate changes relative\nto market rate changes) of approximately 50%\nto its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit\naccounts when determining its interest rate\nsensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing\ndeposit accounts include interest checking\naccounts, savings accounts and money market\naccounts that do not have a contractual\nmaturity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nTruist has established parameters related to\ninterest rate sensitivity measures that\nprescribe a maximum impact on net interest\nincome under different interest rate scenarios\nthat would result in an escalation to the\nBoard. The following parameters and interest\nrate scenarios are considered Truist's primary\nmeasures of interest rate risk:\n\n\u2022 Maximum impact on net interest income of\n7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25\nbasis point change in interest rates each\nquarter for four quarters; and a\n\n\u2022 Maximum impact on net interest income of 10%\nfor an immediate 100 basis point parallel\nchange in rates.\n\nThis interest rate shock analysis is designed\nto create an outer bound of acceptable\ninterest rate risk.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nwould increase interest-bearing funds to\noffset the loss of this advantageous funding\nsource.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist's interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of demand deposits and an\nassociated increase in managed rate deposits\nunder various scenarios. For purposes of this\nanalysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta\nof managed rate deposits for the replacement\nof the demand deposits at 100%.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 67\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  35:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resul\u2026                \n  Line\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assum\u2026                \n  Chan\u2026        at            a                \n  in       Decem\u2026       Decre\u2026                \n  Rates       31,           in                \n  (bps)      2020       Nonin\u2026                \n              (1)       Demand                \n                        Depos\u2026                \n              $20          $40                \n           Billi\u2026       Billi\u2026                \n  Up         4.18  %      3.36  %    2.54  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      3.24         2.64       2.04     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at December 31, 2020 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on\nlonger-term projected changes in asset and\nliability values given potential changes in\ninterest rates. This measure allows Truist to\nanalyze interest rate risk that falls outside\nthe net interest income simulation period. The\nEVE model is a discounted cash flow of the\nportfolio of assets, liabilities and\nderivative instruments.

During October\n2020, Truist initiated a new investment\nsecurities fair value hedging program, using\nfixed interest rate swaps to hedge prepayable\nsecurities. Truist also uses derivatives to\nfacilitate transactions on behalf of its\nclients and as part of associated hedging\nactivities. As of December 31, 2020, Truist\nhad derivative financial instruments\noutstanding with notional amounts totaling\n$322.9 billion, with an associated net fair\nvalue of $3.3 billion. See \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\" for\nadditional disclosures.\n\nLIBOR in its current form was anticipated to\nno longer be available after 2021. For most\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, subject to the\nresults of a consultation period ending\nJanuary 2021, the administrator of LIBOR is\nconsidering extending publication until June\n30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently by Truist,\nincluding one week and two month U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, are still anticipated to cease\npublication at December 31, 2021, based on\nthis new guidance. Truist has U.S. dollar\nLIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond June\n30, 2023. To prepare for the transition to an\nalternative reference rate, management has\nformed a cross-functional project team to\naddress the LIBOR transition. The project team\nhas performed an assessment to identify the\npotential risks related to the transition from\nLIBOR to a new index. The project team\nprovides updates to Executive Leadership and\nthe Board.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases is under review and certain\ncontracts will need updated provisions for the\ntransition. Current fallback language used for\nnew, renewed, and modified contracts is\ngenerally consistent with ARRC\nrecommendations. Updates to current fallback\nlanguage will be evaluated according to new\nregulatory guidance for the extension of\ntimelines for the transition and expectations\nfor production of U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts\nduring 2021. Truist continues to manage the\nimpact of these contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and related operational and market\nrisks on established project plans for\nbusiness and operational readiness for the\ntransition. Market risks associated with this\nchange are dependent on the alternative\nreference rates available and market\nconditions at transition. For a further\ndiscussion of the various risks associated\nwith the potential cessation of LIBOR and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates,\nrefer to the section titled \"Item1A. Risk\nFactors.\" In 2020, Truist began offering SOFR-\nbased lending solutions to wholesale and\nconsumer clients, and entered into SOFR-based\nderivative contracts. Truist expects SOFR to\nbecome a more commonly-used pricing benchmark\nacross the industry. Truist continues to\nevaluate SOFR for additional product offerings\nand other alternative reference rates as\nreplacements for LIBOR.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist's risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements, or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies, procedures, and\nmethodologies exist for all covered positions.\nAdditionally, trading positions are subject to\nindependent price verification. See \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\" \"Note 18.\nFair Value Disclosures,\" and \"Critical\nAccounting Policies\" herein for discussion of\nvaluation policies, procedures and\nmethodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\nnot material. Consistent with the Market Risk\nRule requirements, the Company performs pre-\npurchase due diligence on each securitization\nposition to identify the characteristics\nincluding, but not limited to, deal structure\nand the asset quality of the underlying\nassets, that materially affect valuation and\nperformance. Securitization positions are\nsubject to Truist\u2019s comprehensive risk\nmanagement framework, which includes daily\nmonitoring against a suite of limits. There\nwere no off-balance sheet securitization\npositions during the reporting period.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of December 31, 2020.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. Prior to the\nintegration of the two institutional broker\ndealer businesses to form Truist Securities in\nthe third quarter of 2020, Truist operated two\nhistorical VaR models and the aggregate\ncompany-wide VaR across the systems was\ndetermined additively with no benefit of\ndiversification. The heritage BB&T VaR model\nwas retired following the formation of Truist\nSecurities. Following the formation of Truist\nSecurities, VaR is calculated on a\nconsolidated basis using the Truist VaR\nengine. For risk management purposes, the VaR\ncalculation is based on a historical\nsimulation approach and measures the potential\ntrading losses using a one-day holding period\nat a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For\nMarket Risk Rule purposes, the Company\ncalculates VaR using a 10-day holding period\nand a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent\nlimitations of the VaR methodology, such as\nthe assumption that past market behavior is\nindicative of future market performance, VaR\nis only one of several tools used to measure\nand manage market risk. Other tools used to\nactively manage market risk include stress\ntesting, profit and loss attribution, and stop\nloss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for both the three\nand twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019. The increase from the prior year was\nmainly due to the integration of the heritage\nSunTrust trading business and the market\nvolatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As\nillustrated in the tables below, the inclusion\nof volatility levels observed in March 2020 in\nthe 12-month VaR historic look-back window led\nto a convergence between VaR and Stressed VaR\nmeasures.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\n                                              \n  T\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026                                          \n  V\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  Y\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  3\u2026       20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (\u2026       10\u2026       1-\u2026       10\u2026       1-\u2026  \n  in       Ho\u2026       Ho\u2026       Ho\u2026       Ho\u2026  \n  m\u2026       Pe\u2026       Pe\u2026       Pe\u2026       Pe\u2026  \n  V\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $   65    $   11    $    9    $    2  \n  A\u2026        27         6         1         1  \n  M\u2026         3         1         \u2014         \u2014  \n  P\u2026        28         7         7         2  \n  V\u2026                                          \n  by                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                   2                   2  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                   9                   3  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                   2                   2  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                   \u2014                   \u2014  \n  R\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                  -5                  -5  \n  D\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                   7                   2  \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model.\n\nThere were seven company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions during the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2020, primarily driven by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which led to a sudden and\nsignificant repricing of instruments in\nfinancial markets during the first and second\nquarters of 2020, as well as an increase in\nmarket volatility and deterioration in overall\nmarket liquidity. In accordance with\nestablished policy and procedure, all company-\nwide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly\nreviewed in the context of VaR model use and\nperformance. Following such reviews, Truist\ndetermined that the VaR model performed in\nline with expectations and that the\nsignificant moves in underlying market risk\nfactors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would\nnot typically have been captured within the\n1-day VaR measure.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company's comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \"Capital\" section of this\nMD&A for additional discussion of capital\nadequacy.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nCredit risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nthe default, inability or unwillingness of a\nborrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the\nterms of any financial obligation to Truist or\notherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk\nexists in all activities where success depends\non the performance of a borrower, obligor, or\ncounterparty. Credit risk arises when Truist\nfunds are extended, committed, invested, or\notherwise exposed through actual or implied\ncontractual agreements, whether on or off-\nbalance sheet. Credit risk increases when the\ncredit quality of an issuer whose securities\nor other instruments the bank holds\ndeteriorates.\n\nTruist has established the following general\npractices to manage credit risk:\n\n\u2022 limiting the amount of credit that\nindividual lenders may extend to a borrower;\n\n\u2022 establishing a process for credit approval\naccountability;\n\n\u2022 careful initial underwriting and analysis of\nborrower, transaction, market and collateral\nrisks;\n\n\u2022 ongoing servicing and monitoring of\nindividual loans and lending relationships;\n\n\u2022 continuous monitoring of the portfolio,\nmarket dynamics and the economy; and\n\n\u2022 periodically reevaluating the Company's\nstrategy and overall exposure as economic,\nmarket and other relevant conditions change.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nThe following discussion describes the\nunderwriting procedures and overall risk\nmanagement of Truist's lending function.\n\nUnderwriting Approach\n\nThe loan portfolio is a primary source of\nprofitability and risk; therefore, proper loan\nunderwriting is critical to Truist's long-term\nfinancial success. Truist's underwriting\napproach is designed to define acceptable\ncombinations of specific risk-mitigating\nfeatures that promote credit relationships\nthat conform to Truist's risk philosophy.\nProvided below is a summary of the most\nsignificant underwriting criteria used to\nevaluate new loans and loan renewals:\n\n\u2022 Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash\nflow adequacy is a necessary condition of\ncreditworthiness, meaning that loans must\neither be clearly supported by a borrower's\ncash flow or, if not, must be justified by\nsecondary repayment sources.\n\n\u2022 Secondary sources of repayment - alternative\nrepayment funds are a significant risk-\nmitigating factor as long as they are liquid,\ncan be easily accessed, and provide adequate\nresources to supplement the primary cash flow\nsource.\n\n\u2022 Value of any underlying collateral - loans\nare generally secured by the asset being\nfinanced. Because an analysis of the primary\nand secondary sources of repayment is the most\nimportant factor, collateral, unless it is\nliquid, does not justify loans that cannot be\nserviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 Overall creditworthiness of the client,\ntaking into account the client's\nrelationships, both past and current, with\nTruist and other lenders - Truist's success\ndepends on building lasting and mutually\nbeneficial relationships with clients, which\ninvolves assessing their financial position\nand background.\n\n\u2022 Level of equity invested in the transaction\n- in general, borrowers are required to\ncontribute or invest a portion of their own\nfunds prior to any loan advances.\n\nRefer to the \"Lending Activities\" section in\nthis MD&A for a discussion of each loan and\nlease portfolio.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risk                              \n                                              \nLiquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist\nwill be unable to meet its obligations as they\ncome due because of an inability to obtain\nadequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or\n(ii) Truist cannot easily unwind or offset\nspecific exposures without significantly\nlowering market prices because of inadequate\nmarket depth or market disruptions (market\nliquidity risk).\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nCompliance risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nviolations of laws, rules or regulations, or\nfrom non-conformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies and procedures or\nethical standards. This risk exposes Truist to\nfines, civil monetary penalties, payment of\ndamages and the voiding of contracts.\nCompliance risk can result in diminished\nreputation, reduced franchise or enterprise\nvalue, limited business opportunities and\nlessened expansion potential.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risk                              \n                                              \nStrategic risk is the risk of financial loss,\ndiminished stakeholder confidence, or negative\nimpact to human capital resulting from\nineffective strategy setting and execution,\nadverse business decisions, or lack of\nresponsiveness to changes in the banking\nindustry and operating environment. Truist is\ncommitted to fulfilling its overall strategic\nobjectives by selecting business strategies\nand operating businesses in a manner\nconsistent with achieving\nprofitability/earnings growth and maintaining\nstrong confidence and trust with its key\nstakeholder constituencies.\n                                              \n  Reputation Risk                             \n                                              \nReputation risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, enterprise\nvalue, the Truist brand, and public confidence\narising from negative publicity or public\nopinion, whether real or perceived, regarding\nTruist's business practices, products,\nservices, transactions, or other activities\nundertaken by Truist, its representatives, or\nits partners. A negative reputation may impair\nTruist's relationship with clients, teammates,\ncommunities or shareholders, and it is often a\nresidual risk that arises when other risks are\nnot managed properly.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\ninadequate or failed internal processes,\npeople and systems or from external events. It\nincludes legal risk, which is the risk of loss\narising from defective transactions,\nlitigation or claims made, or the failure to\nadequately protect company-owned assets. An\noperational loss occurs when an event results\nin a loss or reserve originating from\noperational risk.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk\n\nModel risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital from decisions\nbased on incorrect or misused model outputs.\nTruist uses models for many purposes,\nincluding the valuation of financial\npositions, estimation of credit losses, and\nthe measurement of risk. Valuation models are\nused to value certain financial instruments\nfor which quoted prices may not be readily\navailable. Valuation models are also used as\ninputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself,\nregulatory capital, stress testing and the\nACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs,\nwho are responsible for the development,\nimplementation and use of their models.\nOversight of these functions is performed by\nthe MRM, which is a component of the RMO. Once\nmodels have been approved, model owners are\nresponsible for the maintenance of an\nappropriate operating environment and must\nmonitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on a recurring basis. Models are\nupdated in response to changes in portfolio\ncomposition, industry and economic conditions,\ntechnological capabilities and other\ndevelopments.\n\nMRM manages model risk in a holistic manner\nthrough a suite of model governance and model\nvalidation activities. The risk of each model\nis assessed and classified into various risk\ntiers. Additionally, MRM maintains an\nenterprise-wide model inventory containing\nrelevant model information. Regarding model\nvalidation, MRM utilizes internal validation\nanalysts and managers with skill sets in\npredictive modeling to perform detailed\nreviews of model development, implementation\nand conceptual soundness. On certain\noccasions, the MRM will also engage external\nparties to assist with validation efforts.\nOnce in a production environment, MRM assesses\na model\u2019s performance on a periodic basis\nthrough ongoing monitoring reviews. MRM tracks\nissues that have been identified during model\nvalidation or through ongoing monitoring, and\nengages with model owners to ensure their\ntimely remediation. MRM gauges model risk\nutilizing a collection of key risk indicators,\nwhich are periodically reported to relevant\ncommittees, including but not limited to, the\nModel Risk Management Committee as well as the\nBoard Risk Committee. MRM will also present\nmodel risk topics to the Board Risk Committee\nas necessary.\n\nMerger Integration Risk\n\nThe Truist Merger Program was designed to\nensure successful integration following the\nMerger through strong governance practices and\ncontrols, with processes, metrics and\nreporting exemplifying a strong risk culture.\nThe core Truist Merger Program structure\nconsists of key stakeholders from each line of\nbusiness. Integration activities and risk\nmitigation are monitored through established\nworkgroups and Truist Merger Program\nleadership, with oversight and escalation into\nthe Merger Oversight Committee (as the primary\ncommittee), TMC and Board Technology\nCommittee.\n                                              \n  Technology Risk                             \n                                              \nTechnology risk is the business risk\nassociated with the use, ownership, operation,\ninvolvement, influence and adoption of\ninformation technology across the Company.\nTruist has defined and adopted a technology\nrisk framework that provides the foundation\nfor technology risk strategy, program and\noversight and defines key objectives,\noperating model components, risk domains and\ncapabilities to manage this risk.\n\nDigital technology is constantly evolving, and\nnew and unforeseen threats and actions by\nothers may disrupt operations or result in\nlosses beyond Truist\u2019s risk control\nthresholds. Truist maintains a comprehensive\nrisk-based information security /\ncybersecurity framework implemented through\npeople, processes, and technology whereby\nTruist actively monitors and evaluates\nthreats, events, and the performance of its\nbusiness operations and continually adapts its\nrisk mitigation activities accordingly.\n\nTruist's framework aligns with those of the\nNational Institute of Standards and\nTechnology, the International Standards\nOrganization 27000 series, the IT Governance\nInstitute, and the Control Objectives for\nInformation and Related Technology, as well as\nconforms with the requirements and guidance\nfrom applicable regulatory authorities,\nincluding the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council. In addition, Truist\u2019s\nframework, which includes internally and\nexternally focused capabilities, drives the\ndevelopment and implementation of Truist\u2019s\nholistic data security strategy that is\ndesigned to reduce risk while enabling\nTruist\u2019s corporate business objectives.\n\nTruist has built an organization with\ndedicated, skilled talent to operationalize\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity strategy. The\ncybersecurity strategy is enabled by\ncontinuous enhancement of Truist\u2019s\nmultilayered defenses including advanced\ncapabilities for early and rapid cyber threat\nidentification, detection, protection,\nresponse, and recovery. Truist participates in\nthe federally recognized financial sector\ninformation sharing organization structure,\nknown as the Financial Services Information\nSharing and Analysis Center as a key part of\nthe Company\u2019s cyber threat intelligence and\nresponse programs, as well as other industry\norganizations and initiatives that promote\nindustry best practices such as harmonized\ncybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and\nsecure consumer financial data sharing.\n\nTo further mitigate the risks presented by an\nevolving cyber threat landscape, Truist\nprovides data protection guidance to clients\nand promotes data protection awareness and\naccountability through mandatory teammate\ntraining. Truist conducts scenario-driven test\nexercises simulating impacts and consequences\ndeveloped through analysis of real-world\ntechnology incidents as well as known and\nanticipated cyber threats. These exercises are\ndesigned to assess the viability of Truist\u2019s\ncrisis response and management programs and\nprovide the basis for continuous improvement.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity risk program is\noverseen by Executive Leadership and the\nBoard. Regular updates on the status of the\ncybersecurity risk program, including\ninformation security risks and incidents,\nemerging threats, and control environment, are\naggregated and escalated to Executive\nLeadership and the Board. Additionally, Truist\nhas a Cyber Incident Response Team that\nmanages significant cyber-specific events with\nescalation up to Executive Leadership and the\nBoard. Truist\u2019s framework requires annual\nexercises at a minimum to test Truist\u2019s\npreparedness. The Board devotes significant\ntime and attention to its oversight of cyber\nsecurity risk and approves related information\nsecurity policies. Although Truist has\ninvested substantial resources to manage and\nreduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible\nto completely eliminate this risk. Truist\nobtains insurance that protects against\ncertain losses, expenses, and damages\nassociated with cybersecurity risk. See Item\n1A, \"Risk Factors,\" for additional information\nregarding cybersecurity risk.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist's funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities. As of December 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, Truist's liquid asset\nbuffer, as a percent of total assets, was\n20.2% and 16.5%, respectively.\n\nThe LCR rule directs large U.S. banking\norganizations to hold unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets sufficient to withstand\nprojected 30-day total net cash outflows, each\nas defined under the LCR rule. As of January\n1, 2020, Truist is subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist's average LCR\nwas 113% for the three months ended December\n31, 2020, well above the regulatory minimum of\n100%.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company's assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, retirement of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt.\n\nSee \"Note 22. Parent Company Financial\nInformation\" for additional information\nregarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt\ntransactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At December 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the Parent Company had 43\nmonths and 29 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n22 months and 20 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nTruist Bank\n\nTruist carefully manages liquidity risk at\nTruist Bank. Truist Bank's primary source of\nfunding is client deposits. Continued access\nto client deposits is highly dependent on\npublic confidence in the stability of Truist\nBank and its ability to return funds to\nclients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. At December 31, 2020, Truist\nBank had approximately $198.7 billion of\navailable secured borrowing capacity, which\nrepresents approximately 9.4 times the amount\nof wholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless. In addition to secured borrowing\nsources, Truist had excess eligible cash at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of $13.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe ability to raise funding at competitive\nprices is affected by the rating agencies'\nviews of the Parent Company's and Truist\nBank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and\nearnings. Management meets with the rating\nagencies on a regular basis to discuss current\noutlooks. In April 2020, DBRS revised its\noutlook for Truist and Truist Bank from\n\"positive\" to \"stable,\" citing economic\ndeterioration related to COVID-19. DBRS\naffirmed all other ratings for Truist and\nTruist Bank. Additionally, Fitch revised its\noutlook for Truist and Truist Bank from\n\"stable\" to \"negative,\" also citing pandemic-\nrelated economic deterioration. Fitch\ndowngraded Truist\u2019s subordinated debt to A-,\nand upgraded Truist\u2019s preferred stock to BBB,\nin order to align these ratings to its\nrecently revised bank rating methodology.\n\nIn July 2020, Fitch completed the\nimplementation of its revised bank rating\nmethodology. As a result, Fitch downgraded\nTruist\u2019s senior unsecured debt to A and\naffirmed Truist Bank\u2019s senior unsecured and\nsubordinated debt ratings. This rating action\ntaken by Fitch was solely a function of\nimplementing its revised bank rating\nmethodology and did not reflect a change in\nFitch\u2019s current or expected view of Truist\u2019s\nor Truist Bank\u2019s credit fundamentals.\n\nThe ratings for Truist and Truist Bank by the\nmajor rating agencies are detailed in the\ntable below:\n                                              \n  Tab\u2026                                        \n  39:                                         \n  Cre\u2026                                        \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Bank                                        \n          S&P       Mood\u2026    Fitch     DBRS   \n                                       Morn\u2026  \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A- /      A3       A+ /      AH /   \n          A-2                F1        R-1L   \n  Sen\u2026    A-        A3       A         AH     \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Sub\u2026    BBB+      A3       A-        A      \n  Pre\u2026    BBB-      Baa2\u2026    BBB       BBBH   \n  sto\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Ban\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A /       A2       A+ /      AAL /  \n          A-1                F1        R-1M   \n  Sen\u2026    A         A2       A+        AAL    \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Dep\u2026    NA        Aa2 /    AA- /     AAL /  \n                    P-1      F1+       R-1M   \n  Sub\u2026    A-        (P)      A         AH     \n                    A3                        \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  out\u2026                                        \n  Cre\u2026    Stable    Stab\u2026    Negat\u2026    Stab\u2026  \n  tre\u2026                                        \n                                              \nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction.

Truist's\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist's risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries and provide a competitive return\nto shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios,\nwhich include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\nTotal capital are calculated based on\nregulatory guidance related to the measurement\nof capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company's capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management's overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \"well capitalized\"\nminimums. Management has implemented stressed\ncapital ratio minimum targets to evaluate\nwhether capital ratios calculated after the\neffect of alternative capital actions are\nlikely to remain above minimums specified by\nthe FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches\nof stressed minimum targets prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist's capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n           \u2026               \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026                  \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Truist targets are subject to revision\nbased on finalization of pending regulatory\nguidance and other strategic factors.\n\n(2) Truist's goal is to maintain capital\nlevels above all regulatory minimums.\n\n(3) Reflects a SCB of 270 basis points for\nTruist.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, as market\nconditions evolved, Truist received Board\napproval to establish new interim operating\ntargets that provide for sufficient capital\nlevels while allowing the company to support\nclients through the economic downturn. These\ninterim operating targets will be evaluated as\neconomic conditions evolve.\n\nWhile nonrecurring events or management\ndecisions may result in the Company\ntemporarily falling below its operating\ntargets for one or more of these ratios, it is\nmanagement's intent to return to these\noperating targets within a reasonable period\nof time through capital planning. Such\ntemporary decreases below the operating\nminimums shown above are not considered an\ninfringement of Truist's overall capital\npolicy, provided a return above the minimums\nis forecasted to occur within a reasonable\ntime period.\n\nIn August 2020, the Federal Reserve informed\nTruist of its SCB of 270 basis points for\nrisk-based capital ratios. This buffer was\ndetermined based on stress testing results\ndeveloped by the Federal Reserve and is\neffective from October 1, 2020 through\nSeptember 30, 2021, at which point a revised\nSCB will be calculated and provided to Truist.\nConsistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate\nacross the industry, Truist resubmitted its\ncapital plan in November 2020 to reflect\nchanges in financial markets and the\nmacroeconomic outlook. Truist\u2019s review of the\nresults of the 2020 CCAR supervisory stress\ntest notes that the modeled outcomes shown by\nthe FRB differ from those calculated by the\nCompany. Truist believes those differences are\nattributable in part to the application of\npurchase accounting associated with the\nMerger. Purchase accounting adjustments could\nresult in a reduction in provision expense and\nan increase in pre-provision net revenue.\nThese differences could result in higher\ncapital ratios than were reflected in the CCAR\nresults.\n\nIn December 2020, the Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase of up to $2.0\nbillion of the Company\u2019s common stock\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2021, as\nwell as certain other actions to optimize\nTruist\u2019s capital position. Management\u2019s\nintention is to maintain an approximate 10%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio after considering\nstrategic actions such as non-bank\nacquisitions or stock repurchases, as well as\nchanges in risk-weighted assets. Any stock\nrepurchase activity will be informed by\neconomic and regulatory considerations as well\nas Truist\u2019s capital position, earnings\noutlook, and capital deployment priorities.\n\nPayments of cash dividends and repurchases of\ncommon shares are the methods used to manage\nany excess capital generated. In addition,\nmanagement closely monitors the Parent\nCompany's double leverage ratio (investments\nin subsidiaries as a percentage of\nshareholders' equity). The active management\nof the subsidiaries' equity capital, as\ndescribed above, is the process used to manage\nthis important driver of Parent Company\nliquidity and is a key element in the\nmanagement of Truist's capital position.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\nManagement intends to maintain capital at\nTruist Bank at levels that will result in\nclassification as \"well-capitalized\" for\nregulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is\nmanagement's intent to maintain Truist Bank's\ncapital at levels that result in regulatory\nrisk-based capital ratios that are generally\ncomparable with peers of similar size,\ncomplexity and risk profile. If the capital\nlevels of Truist Bank increase above these\nguidelines, excess capital may be transferred\nto the Parent Company in the form of special\ndividend payments, subject to regulatory and\nother operating considerations.\n\nManagement's capital deployment plan in order\nof preference is to focus on (i) organic\ngrowth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic\nopportunities and/or share repurchases\ndepending on opportunities in the marketplace\nand Truist's interest and ability to proceed\nwith acquisitions.\n\nTruist Bank's capital ratios are presented in\nthe following table:\n                                              \n  Table 42: Capital                           \n  Ratios - Truist                             \n  Bank                                        \n  December 31,           2020       2019      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CET1 to                                     \n  risk-weighted          11.0  %    10.6  %   \n  assets                                      \n  Tier 1 capital to                           \n  risk-weighted          11.0       10.6      \n  assets                                      \n  Total capital to                            \n  risk-weighted          13.0       12.0      \n  assets                                      \n  Leverage ratio (1)      8.7       14.5      \n  Supplementary           7.5             NA  \n  leverage ratio (2)                          \n                                              \n(1) The leverage ratio is calculated using end\nof period Tier 1 capital and quarterly average\ntangible assets.

These measures are useful for\nevaluating the performance of a business\nconsistently, whether acquired or developed\ninternally. Truist's management uses these\nmeasures to assess the quality of capital and\nreturns relative to balance sheet risk. These\ncapital measures are not necessarily\ncomparable to similar capital measures that\nmay be presented by other companies.\n\nCapital ratios improved compared to year-end\n2020, due to growth in CET1 capital, partially\noffset by higher risk-weighted assets.\nTruist's capital levels remain strong compared\nto the regulatory levels for well capitalized\nbanks at December 31, 2020. Truist\u2019s other\ncapital measures also improved as Truist\nissued various capital instruments to\nstrengthen its capital position. Truist issued\n$3.5 billion of preferred stock and redeemed\n$500 million of Series K preferred stock\nduring 2020. In addition, Truist issued $1.3\nbillion of subordinated debt. During\n2020,Truist paid $2.4 billion in common stock\ndividends or $1.80 per share, which resulted\nin a total payout ratio of 58.0% for the year.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Loans and leases are net of unearned\nincome and include LHFS.\n\nFourth Quarter 2020 Results Compared to Fourth\nQuarter 2019\n\nTotal taxable-equivalent revenues were $5.7\nbillion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an\nincrease of $2.0 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter, reflecting an increase of\n$1.1 billion in taxable-equivalent net\ninterest income and an increase of $887\nmillion in noninterest income.\n\nNet interest margin was 3.08%, down 33 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter.\nAverage earning assets increased $175.6\nbillion. The increase in average earning\nassets reflects a $114.5 billion increase in\naverage total loans and leases and a $41.4\nbillion increase in average securities.\nAverage other earning assets increased $17.5\nbillion primarily due to higher interest-\nearning balances at the Federal Reserve.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased\n$107.3 billion compared to the earlier\nquarter. Average interest-bearing deposits\nincreased $101.9 billion, average long-term\ndebt increased $10.4 billion and average\nshort-term borrowings decreased $5.0 billion.\nThe significant increases in earning assets\nand liabilities are primarily due to the\nMerger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19\npandemic and the resulting government stimulus\nprograms.\n\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nfourth quarter of 2020 was 4.12%, down 79\nbasis points compared to the earlier quarter,\nreflecting the impact of rate decreases,\npartially offset by purchase accounting\naccretion from merged loans. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 1.60%, down\n105 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter primarily due to lower yields on new\npurchases.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.07%,\ndown 50 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter, and the average cost of interest-\nbearing deposits was 0.11%, down 71 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter. The\naverage rate on short-term borrowings was\n0.77%, down 138 basis points compared to the\nearlier quarter. The average rate on long-term\ndebt was 1.64%, down 128 basis points compared\nto the earlier quarter. The lower rates on\ninterest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower\nrate environment. The lower rates on long-term\ndebt also reflect the amortization of the fair\nvalue mark on the assumed debt and the\nissuance of new long-term debt.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $177\nmillion, compared to $171 million for the\nearlier quarter. Net charge-offs for the\nfourth quarter of 2020 totaled $205 million\ncompared to $192 million in the earlier\nquarter. The net charge-off rate for the\ncurrent quarter of 0.27% was down 13 basis\npoints compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 79\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter of\n2020 increased $887 million compared to the\nearlier quarter. The earlier quarter included\na loss of $116 million from the sale of\nsecurities. Excluding the securities losses,\nnoninterest income increased $771 million,\nwith nearly all categories of noninterest\nincome being impacted by the Merger. Insurance\nincome increased $36 million due to strong\nproduction and premium growth, as well as\nacquisitions. Investment banking and trading\nincome, commercial real estate related income,\nwealth management income and residential\nmortgage banking income all had improved\nperformance compared to the combined levels\nfrom the earlier quarter. Service charges on\ndeposits continued to rebound, but remained\nbelow 2019 combined levels due to reduced\noverdraft incident rates.\n\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter of\n2020 was up $1.3 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and other incremental\noperating expenses related to the Merger\nincreased $85 million and $78 million,\nrespectively. Excluding the merger-related\nitems mentioned above and the impact of an\nincrease of $101 million of amortization\nexpense for intangibles, adjusted noninterest\nexpense was up $994 million primarily\nreflecting the impact of the Merger.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $311\nmillion for the fourth quarter of 2020,\ncompared to $153 million for the earlier\nquarter. This produced an effective tax rate\nfor the fourth quarter of 2020 of 19.0%,\ncompared to 17.4% for the earlier quarter. The\nhigher effective tax rate is primarily due to\nhigher pre-tax income.\n                                              \n  Reclassifications                           \n                                              \nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications\nhave been made to prior period information to\nconform to the current presentation. Such\nreclassifications had no effect on previously\nreported shareholders' equity or net income.\nRefer to \"Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" for\nadditional discussion regarding\nreclassifications.\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \nThe accounting and reporting policies of\nTruist are in accordance with GAAP and conform\nto the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The\nfinancial position and results of operations\nare affected by management's application of\naccounting policies, including estimates,\nassumptions and judgments made to arrive at\nthe carrying value of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported for revenues and\nexpenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations and related disclosures.\nUnderstanding Truist's accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. Accordingly, Truist's significant\naccounting policies and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\ndetail in \"Note 1. Basis of Presentation.\"\n\nThe following is a summary of Truist's\ncritical accounting policies that are highly\ndependent on estimates, assumptions and\njudgments. These critical accounting policies\nare reviewed with the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors on a periodic basis.\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nTruist's policy is to maintain an ACL, which\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to the\nloan and lease portfolios and off-balance\nsheet lending commitments at the balance sheet\ndate. Estimates of expected future loan and\nlease losses are determined by using\nstatistical models and management\u2019s judgement.\nThe models are designed to forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic forecast data to historical\nexperience. The models are generally applied\nat the portfolio level to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic data used in the models is based\non forecasted variables for the reasonable and\nsupportable period of two years. Beyond this\nforecast period the models gradually revert to\nlong-term historical loss conditions over a\none year period. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough contractual maturity, giving\nappropriate consideration to expected\nprepayments unless the borrower has a right to\nrenew that is not cancellable or it is\nreasonably expected that the loan will be\nmodified as a TDR.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions and capture risks in the\nportfolio such as considerations with respect\nto the impact of current economic events, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain. These events\nmay include, but are not limited to, political\nconditions, legislation that may directly or\nindirectly affect the banking industry and\neconomic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which\nTruist conducts business.\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics and significant loans\nthat are considered collateral-dependent are\nindividually evaluated. For these loans, the\nALLL is determined through review of data\nspecific to the borrower and related\ncollateral, if any. For TDRs, default\nexpectations and estimated prepayment speeds\nthat are specific to each of the restructured\nloan populations are incorporated in the\ndetermination of the ALLL.\n\n80 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is similar to that used to\ndetermine the funded component of the ALLL and\nis measured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default. A detailed\ndiscussion of the methodology used in\ndetermining the ACL is included in \"Note 1.\nBasis of Presentation.\"\n                                              \n  Fair Value of Financial Instruments         \n                                              \nThe vast majority of assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis\nare based on either quoted market prices or\nmarket prices for similar instruments. Refer\nto \"Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures\" for\nadditional disclosures regarding the fair\nvalue of financial instruments and \"Note 2.\nBusiness Combinations\" for additional\ndisclosures regarding business combinations.\n\nSecurities\n\nTruist generally utilizes a third-party\npricing service in determining the fair value\nof its AFS investment securities, whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. Fair\nvalue measurements for investment securities\nare derived from market-based pricing matrices\nthat were developed using observable inputs\nthat include benchmark yields, benchmark\nsecurities, reported trades, offers, bids,\nissuer spreads and broker quotes. Management\nperforms procedures to evaluate the fair\nvalues provided by the third-party service\nprovider. These procedures, which are\nperformed independent of the responsible BU,\ninclude comparison of pricing information\nreceived from the third party pricing service\nto other third-party pricing sources, review\nof additional information provided by the\nthird-party pricing service and other third-\nparty sources for selected securities and\nback-testing to compare the price realized on\nsecurity sales to the daily pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service. The Enterprise Valuation\nCommittee, which provides oversight to\nTruist's enterprise-wide IPV function, is\nresponsible for the comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service or internally to other third-\nparty pricing sources, approving tolerance\nlimits determined by IPV for price comparison\nexceptions, reviewing significant changes to\npricing and valuation policies and reviewing\nand approving the pricing decisions made on\nany illiquid and hard-to-price securities.\nWhen market observable data is not available,\nwhich generally occurs due to the lack of\nliquidity or inactive markets for certain\nsecurities, the valuation of the security is\nsubjective and may involve substantial\njudgment by management to reflect unobservable\ninput assumptions.\n\nMSRs\n\nTruist's primary class of MSRs for which it\nseparately manages the economic risks relates\nto residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do\nnot trade in an active, open market with\nreadily observable prices. While sales of MSRs\ndo occur, the precise terms and conditions\ntypically are not readily available.\nAccordingly, Truist estimates the fair value\nof residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS\nvaluation model to project residential MSR\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios, which are then discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The OAS model considers\nportfolio characteristics, contractually-\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment\nassumptions, delinquency rates, late charges,\nother ancillary revenue, costs to service and\nother economic factors. Truist reassesses and\nperiodically adjusts the underlying inputs and\nassumptions in the OAS model to reflect market\nconditions and assumptions that a market\nparticipant would consider in valuing the\nresidential MSR asset.\n\nFair value estimates and assumptions are\ncompared to industry surveys, recent market\nactivity, actual portfolio experience and,\nwhen available, observable market data. Due to\nthe nature of the valuation inputs,\nresidential MSRs are classified within Level 3\nof the valuation hierarchy. The value of\nresidential MSRs is significantly affected by\nmortgage interest rates available in the\nmarketplace, which influence mortgage loan\nprepayment speeds. In general, during periods\nof declining interest rates, the value of MSRs\ndeclines due to increasing prepayments\nattributable to increased mortgage-refinance\nactivity. Conversely, during periods of rising\ninterest rates, the value of residential MSRs\ngenerally increases due to reduced refinance\nactivity. Truist typically hedges against\nmarket value changes in the residential MSRs.\nRefer to \"Note 8. Loan Servicing\" for\nquantitative disclosures reflecting the effect\nthat changes in management's assumptions would\nhave on the fair value of residential MSRs.\n\nLHFS\n\nTruist originates certain residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans for sale to\ninvestors that are measured at fair value. The\nfair value is primarily based on quoted market\nprices for securities backed by similar types\nof loans. Changes in the fair value are\nrecorded as components of residential mortgage\nincome and commercial real estate related\nincome, while the related origination costs\nare generally recognized in personnel expense\nwhen incurred. The changes in fair value are\nlargely driven by changes in interest rates\nsubsequent to loan funding and changes in the\nfair value of servicing associated with the\nLHFS. Truist uses various derivative\ninstruments to mitigate the economic effect of\nchanges in fair value of the underlying loans.\nLHFS also includes certain loans, generally\ncarried at LOCOM, where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nAdjustments to reflect unrealized gains and\nlosses resulting from changes in fair value,\nup to the original carrying amount, and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nare classified as noninterest income. The fair\nvalue of these loans is estimated using\nobservable market prices when available,\nalthough may also incorporate other\nunobservable inputs such as indicative bids or\nbroker price opinions. Refer to \"Note 1. Basis\nof Presentation\" for further description of\nthe Company\u2019s accounting for LHFS.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 81\nTrading Loans\n\nTruist elects to measure certain loans at fair\nvalue for financial reporting where fair value\naligns with the underlying business purpose.\nSpecifically, loans included within this\nclassification include trading loans that are\n(i) purchased in connection with the Company\u2019s\nTRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and\ntrading business within the C&CB segment, or\n(iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to \"Note 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies,\" and \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\" for further\ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s TRS business. The\nloans purchased in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS and sales and trading businesses\nare primarily commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans valued based on quoted prices\nfor identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active by a third party\npricing service. SBA loans are fully\nguaranteed by the U.S. government as to\ncontractual principal and interest and there\nis sufficient observable trading activity upon\nwhich to base the estimate of fair value.\n\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nTruist uses derivatives to manage various\nfinancial risks and in a dealer capacity to\nfacilitate client transactions. Truist\nmitigates credit risk by subjecting\ncounterparties to credit reviews and approvals\nsimilar to those used in making loans and\nother extensions of credit. In addition,\ncertain counterparties are required to provide\ncollateral to Truist when their unsecured loss\npositions exceed certain negotiated limits.\nThe fair values of derivative financial\ninstruments are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable data for interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equity and credit. The fair\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments, which\nare related to mortgage loan commitments, is\nbased on quoted market prices adjusted for\ncommitments that Truist does not expect to\nfund and includes the value attributable to\nthe net servicing fee. Refer to \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\" for further\ninformation on the Company\u2019s derivatives.\n\nPurchased loans\n\nThe fair value for purchased loans in a\nbusiness combination is based on a discounted\ncash flow methodology that considers credit\nloss expectations, market interest rates and\nother market factors such as liquidity from\nthe perspective of a market participant. Loans\nare grouped together according to similar\ncharacteristics and are treated in the\naggregate when applying various valuation\ntechniques. The probability of default, loss\ngiven default and prepayment assumptions are\nkey factors driving credit losses which are\nembedded into the estimated cash flows. These\nassumptions are informed by internal data on\nloan characteristics, historical loss\nexperience, and current and forecasted\neconomic conditions. The interest and\nliquidity component of the estimate is\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof each loan. The discount rates used for\nloans are based on current market rates for\nnew originations of comparable loans and\ninclude adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rate does not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nThe acquisition method of accounting requires\nthat assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin business combinations are recorded at their\nfair values. This often involves estimates\nbased on third party valuations or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow\nanalyses or other valuation techniques, which\nare inherently subjective. The amortization of\ndefinite-lived intangible assets is based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits to be\nreceived, which is also subjective. Business\ncombinations also typically result in\ngoodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic\nimpairment tests based on the fair values of\nthe reporting units to which the acquired\ngoodwill relates. Refer to \"Note 1. Basis of\nPresentation\" for a description of the\nimpairment testing process.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Truist\u2019s reporting units\nwith goodwill balances were CB&W, C&CB and IH.\nManagement reviews the goodwill of each\nreporting unit for impairment on an annual\nbasis as of October 1 or more often if events\nor circumstances indicate that it is more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value.\nFor its annual impairment review, Truist\nelected to perform a quantitative test of each\nof its reporting units. The quantitative\nimpairment test estimates the fair value of\nthe reporting units using the income approach\nand the market approach, weighted 60% and 40%,\nrespectively. The income approach utilizes a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis. The market\napproach utilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples and\nconsiders a market control premium associated\nwith cost synergies and other cash flow\nbenefits that arise from obtaining control\nover a reporting unit.\n\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates, and applicable\nvaluation multiples based on the comparable\npublic company information. Truist also\nassesses the reasonableness of the aggregate\nestimated fair value of the reporting units by\ncomparison to its market capitalization over a\nreasonable period of time, including\nconsideration of historic bank control\npremiums and the current market.\n\n82 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nMulti-year financial forecasts are developed\nfor each reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions such as net interest\nmargin, expected credit losses, noninterest\nincome, noninterest expense and required\ncapital. Of these inputs, the projection of\nnet interest margin is the most significant to\nthe financial projections of the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units. The long-term growth rate\nused in determining the terminal value of each\nreporting unit was 2.5% as of October 1, 2020,\nbased on management's assessment of the\nminimum expected terminal growth rate of each\nreporting unit. Discount rates are estimated\nbased on the Capital Asset Pricing Model,\nwhich considers the risk-free interest rate,\nmarket risk premium, beta, and unsystematic\nrisk adjustments specific to a particular\nreporting unit. The discount rates are also\ncalibrated based on risks related to the\nprojected cash flows of each reporting unit.\nThe discount rates utilized for the CB&W, C&CB\nand IH reporting units as of October 1, 2020\nwere 11%, 10%, and 9%, respectively.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s annual impairment\nanalysis of goodwill as of October 1, it was\ndetermined for the CB&W, C&CB and IH reporting\nunits that the respective reporting unit's\nfair value was in excess of its respective\ncarrying value as of October 1, 2020; however,\nfor the C&CB reporting unit the fair value of\nthe reporting unit exceeded its carrying value\nby less than 10%, indicating that the goodwill\nof this reporting unit may be at risk of\nimpairment. Circumstances that could\nnegatively impact the fair value for the C&CB\nreporting unit in the future include an\nincrease in the applicable discount rate, an\nincrease in required capital, or deterioration\nin the C&CB reporting unit\u2019s forecasts.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in these\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value. The\nCompany performs sensitivity analyses around\nthese assumptions in order to assess the\nreasonableness of the assumptions, and the\nresulting estimated fair values. The analysis\nof the C&CB reporting unit at October 1, 2020,\nindicated that if the discount rate was\nincreased 100 basis points, the reporting\nunit's fair value would be less than its\ncarrying value, resulting in goodwill\nimpairment. Ultimately, future potential\nchanges in these assumptions may impact the\nestimated fair value of a reporting unit and\ncause the fair value of the reporting unit to\nbe below its carrying value. Additionally, a\nreporting unit's carrying value could change\nbased on market conditions, asset growth, or\nthe risk profile of those reporting units,\nwhich could impact whether the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020, including\nthe continuing effects of the COVID-19\npandemic, concluding that it was not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of one or\nmore of its reporting units is below its\nrespective carrying amount as of December 31,\n2020.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to income tax laws of the\nU.S., its states, and the municipalities in\nwhich the Company conducts business. In\nestimating the net amount due to or to be\nreceived from tax jurisdictions either\ncurrently or in the future, the Company\nassesses the appropriate tax treatment of\ntransactions and filing positions after\nconsidering statutes, regulations, judicial\nprecedent, and other pertinent information.\nThe income tax laws are complex and subject to\ndifferent interpretations by the taxpayer and\nthe relevant government taxing authorities.\nSignificant judgment is required in\ndetermining the tax accruals and in evaluating\nthe Company\u2019s tax positions, including\nevaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in\nthe estimate of accrued taxes occur\nperiodically due to changes in tax rates,\ninterpretations of tax laws and new judicial\nguidance, the status of examinations by the\ntax authorities, and newly enacted statutory\nand regulatory guidance that could impact the\nrelative merits and risks of tax positions.\nThese changes, when they occur, impact tax\nexpense and can materially affect operating\nresults. Truist reviews tax positions\nquarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new\ninformation becomes available.\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts\navailable to reduce income taxes payable in\nfuture years. Such assets arise due to\ntemporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities, as well as from NOL and tax\ncredit carryforwards. The Company regularly\nevaluates the realizability of DTAs,\nrecognizing a valuation allowance if, based on\nthe weight of available evidence, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe DTA will not be realized. In determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is necessary,\nthe Company considers the level of taxable\nincome in prior years to the extent that\ncarrybacks are permitted under current tax\nlaws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax\nand taxable income and tax planning strategies\nthat would, if necessary, be implemented.\nTruist currently maintains a valuation\nallowance for certain state carryforwards and\ncertain other state DTAs. For additional\nincome tax information, refer to \"Note 1.\nBasis of Presentation\" and \"Note 14. Income\nTaxes.\"\n                                              \n  Pension and Postretirement Benefit          \n  Obligations                                 \n                                              \nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions,\nwhich are subject to management judgment and\nmay differ significantly if different\nassumptions are used. The discount rate\nassumption used to measure the postretirement\nbenefit obligations is set by reference to a\nhigh-quality corporate bond yield curve and\nthe individual characteristics of the plans\nsuch as projected cash flow patterns and\npayment durations. In 2020, in connection with\nthe merger of the BB&T and SunTrust pension\nplans Truist refined the corporate bond yield\ncurve used in determining the discount rate\nand moved to a AA Above Median yield curve\nfrom the previously used AA rated bond yield\ncurve. The impact of this change was an\nincrease of approximately 11 basis points in\nthe discount rate as of December 31, 2020.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 83\nManagement also considered the sensitivity\nthat changes in the expected return on plan\nassets and the discount rate would have on\npension expense. For the Company\u2019s qualified\nplans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the\ndiscount rate would result in additional\npension expense of approximately $27 million\nfor 2021, while a decrease of 100 basis points\nin the expected return on plan assets would\nresult in an increase of approximately $149\nmillion in pension expense for 2021.

We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 85\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matters communicated below\nare matters arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Certain\nCommercial and Consumer Portfolios\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit losses (ACL)\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe consolidated ACL balance was $6.2 billion\nas of December 31, 2020, including $2.9\nbillion for commercial portfolios and $2.6\nbillion for consumer portfolios. Estimates of\nexpected future credit losses are determined\nby management using quantitative models and by\napplying qualitative adjustments to the\nmodeled results. The models are designed to\nforecast probability of default, exposure at\ndefault, and loss given default by correlating\ncertain macroeconomic forecast data to\nhistorical experience. The models are applied\nto pools of loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The macroeconomic forecast\ndata used in the quantitative models is based\non forecasted variables for a reasonable and\nsupportable period. The qualitative\nadjustments incorporate management judgment\nand are used to account for limitations in\nmodeled results related to current economic\nconditions and other risks in the portfolios.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the ACL for certain commercial and\nconsumer portfolios is a critical audit matter\nare (i) the significant judgment by management\nin determining the ACL quantitative model\nresults and certain qualitative adjustments,\n(ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating the audit evidence\nrelated to the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, and (iii) the\naudit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the ACL estimation\nprocess for certain commercial and consumer\nportfolios, which included controls related to\nthe quantitative model results and certain\nqualitative adjustments. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management\u2019s\nprocess for determining the ACL for certain\ncommercial and consumer portfolios\nquantitative model results and certain\nqualitative adjustments, including evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the quantitative models\nand management\u2019s methodology, testing the data\nused in the estimate, and evaluating the\nreasonableness of judgments used by management\nin estimating certain qualitative adjustments.\nProfessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge were used to assist in evaluating\nthe appropriateness of these quantitative\nmodels and the reasonableness of judgments\nused by management relating to certain\nqualitative adjustments.\n\n86 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Assessment - CB&W\nand C&CB Reporting Units\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated goodwill balance was\n$24.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. The\ngoodwill associated with the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units was $15.8 billion and $6.2\nbillion as of December 31, 2020, respectively.\nManagement reviews the goodwill of each\nreporting unit for impairment on an annual\nbasis as of October 1, or more often, if\nevents or circumstances indicate that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value.\nManagement determines the fair value of\nreporting units using the income approach and\nthe market approach. For the income approach,\nmanagement determines the fair value of the\nreporting units using a discounted cash flow\nanalysis by utilizing a multi-year financial\nforecast for each reporting unit by\nconsidering several inputs and assumptions\nincluding net interest margin, expected credit\nlosses, noninterest income, noninterest\nexpense and required capital.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the annual goodwill impairment\nassessment for the CB&W and C&CB reporting\nunits is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nsignificant judgment by management when\ndetermining the fair value of these reporting\nunits using the income approach, (ii) a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures and evaluating\nthe audit evidence related to management\u2019s\ndiscount rates and net interest margin\nassumptions used in the income approach, and\n(iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to management\u2019s annual\ngoodwill impairment assessment, including\ncontrols over the valuation of the CB&W and\nC&CB reporting units. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management\u2019s\nprocess for determining the fair value of the\nCB&W and C&CB reporting units, evaluating the\nappropriateness of management\u2019s income\napproach, testing the data used in the income\napproach, and evaluating the discount rates\nand net interest margin assumptions used by\nmanagement in the income approach. Evaluating\nmanagement\u2019s assumptions related to the\ndiscount rates and net interest margin\ninvolved evaluating whether the assumptions\nwere reasonable considering the current and\npast performance of the reporting units and\nconsistency with external market and industry\ndata. Professionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge were used to assist in the\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the\nincome approach and the discount rate\nassumption.\n\n/s/

Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nTruist Financial Corporation is a purpose-\ndriven financial services company committed to\ninspire and build better lives and\ncommunities. With the combined history of BB&T\nand SunTrust, Truist has leading market share\nin many high-growth markets in the country.\nThe Company offers a wide range of services\nincluding retail, small business and\ncommercial banking; asset management; capital\nmarkets; commercial real estate; corporate and\ninstitutional banking; insurance; mortgage;\npayments; specialized lending; and wealth\nmanagement. Headquartered in Charlotte, North\nCarolina, Truist is the sixth-largest\ncommercial bank in the U.S. The Company\noperates and measures business activity across\nthree business segments: Consumer Banking and\nWealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and\nInsurance Holdings. For additional information\non the Company\u2019s business segments, see \"Note\n21. Operating Segments.\"\n\nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. The accounting and reporting policies\nare in accordance with GAAP. Additionally,\nwhere applicable, the policies conform to the\naccounting and reporting guidelines prescribed\nby regulatory authorities. The following is a\nsummary of significant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Truist Financial Corporation\nand those subsidiaries that are wholly or\nmajority owned by Truist or over which Truist\nexercises control. Intercompany accounts and\ntransactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe results of operations of companies or\nassets acquired are included from the date of\nacquisition. Results of operations associated\nwith entities or net assets sold are included\nthrough the date of disposition.\nTruist holds investments in certain legal\nentities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are\nlegal entities in which equity investors do\nnot have sufficient equity at risk for the\nentity to independently finance its\nactivities, or as a group, the holders of the\nequity investment at risk lack the power\nthrough voting or similar rights to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nor do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the entity or the right to\nreceive expected residual returns of the\nentity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if\na reporting entity is the primary beneficiary\nof the VIE.\nInvestments in VIEs are evaluated to determine\nif Truist is the primary beneficiary. This\nevaluation gives appropriate consideration to\nthe design of the entity and the variability\nthat the entity was designed to create and\npass along, the relative power of each party,\nand to Truist's obligation to absorb losses or\nreceive residual returns of the entity. Truist\nhas variable interests in certain entities\nthat are not required to be consolidated,\nincluding affordable housing and other\npartnership interests. Refer to \"Note 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies\" for additional\ndisclosures regarding Truist's VIEs.\nInvestments in entities for which the Company\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not control, over operating and\nfinancing decisions are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in Other assets in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost,\nadjusted to reflect the Company\u2019s portion of\nincome, loss, or dividends of the investee.\nTruist records its portion of income or loss\nin Other noninterest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. These\ninvestments are periodically evaluated for\nimpairment.\nThe Company reports any noncontrolling\ninterests in its subsidiaries in the equity\nsection of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nseparately presents the income or loss\nattributable to the noncontrolling interest of\na consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods'\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 93\nBusiness Combinations\nTruist accounts for business combinations\nusing the acquisition method. The accounts of\nan acquired entity are included as of the date\nof acquisition, and any excess of purchase\nprice over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is capitalized as goodwill. See \"Note\n2. Business Combinations\" for further\ndiscussion of the Merger and its impact on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash and\ndue from banks and interest-bearing deposits\nwith banks that have original maturities of\nthree months or less. Accordingly, the\ncarrying amount of such instruments is\nconsidered a reasonable estimate of fair\nvalue. Restricted cash was immaterial at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nSecurities Financing Activities\nThe Company borrows securities and purchases\nsecurities under agreements to resell as part\nof its securities financing activities. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and related counterparty agree on the\namount of collateral required to secure the\nprincipal amount loaned under these\nagreements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements.\nShort-term borrowings include securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, which are\naccounted for as collateralized financing\ntransactions and are recorded at the amounts\nat which the securities were sold, plus\naccrued interest within Short-term borrowings.\nTrading Activities\nVarious trading assets and liabilities are\nused to accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of the Company's\nclients. Product offerings to clients include\ndebt securities, loans traded in the secondary\nmarket, equity securities, derivative\ncontracts, and other similar financial\ninstruments. The Company elects to apply fair\nvalue accounting to trading loans. Trading\nloans include: (i) loans held in connection\nwith the Company's trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans\nguaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii)\nloans made or acquired in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS business. Other trading-related\nactivities include acting as a market maker\nfor certain debt and equity security\ntransactions, derivative instrument\ntransactions, and foreign exchange\ntransactions. Trading assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recognized within Noninterest\nincome in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Interest income on\ntrading account securities is included in\nInterest on other earning assets. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\ntrading activities, see \"Note 16. Commitments\nand Contingencies\" and \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance.\nInvestments in debt securities that are not\nheld for trading purposes are classified as\nAFS.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nAFS securities are reported at estimated fair\nvalue, with unrealized gains and losses\nreported in AOCI, net of deferred income\ntaxes, in the Shareholders' equity section of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or\nlosses realized from the sale of AFS\nsecurities are determined by specific\nidentification and are included in noninterest\nincome.\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit losses are measured on an\nindividual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the US\ngovernment, are highly rated by rating\nagencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. There was no ACL on the Company\u2019s AFS\ndebt securities at December 31, 2020.\n94 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPrior to the adoption of CECL on January 1,\n2020, investment securities in an unrealized\nloss position were evaluated quarterly for\nOTTI. Truist considered such factors as the\nlength of time and the extent to which the\nfair value was below amortized cost, long term\nexpectations and recent experience regarding\nprincipal and interest payments, Truist's\nintent to sell and whether it was more-likely-\nthan-not that the Company would be required to\nsell those securities before the anticipated\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis.\n\nThe credit component of an OTTI loss was\nrecognized in earnings and the non-credit\ncomponent was recognized in AOCI, net of tax,\nin situations where Truist did not intend to\nsell the security and it was more-likely-than-\nnot that Truist would have been required to\nsell the security prior to recovery.\nSubsequent to recognition of OTTI, an increase\nin expected cash flows was recognized as a\nyield adjustment over the remaining expected\nlife of the security based on an evaluation of\nthe nature of the increase.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities that are not classified as\ntrading assets or liabilities are recorded in\nOther assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered\nmarketable and measured at fair value, with\nchanges in the fair value recognized as a\ncomponent of Noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMarketable equity securities include mutual\nfund investments and other publicly traded\nequity securities. Dividends received from\nmarketable equity securities and FHLB stock\nare recognized within Interest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity\nsecurities that are not accounted for under\nthe equity method and that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered non-\nmarketable and are accounted for at cost minus\nimpairment, if any, plus or minus changes\nresulting from observable price changes in\norderly transactions for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same issuer. Any\nadjustments to the carrying value of these\nnon-marketable equity securities are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNon-marketable equity securities include FHLB\nstock and other equity investments. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities, see \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nLHFS\nLHFS includes residential and commercial\nmortgage loans that management intends to sell\nin the secondary market and other loans that\nmanagement has an active plan to sell.\nThe Company elects to apply fair value\naccounting to substantially all residential\nand commercial mortgage loans that are\noriginated with the intent to be sold in the\nsecondary market. Direct loan origination fees\nassociated with these loans are recorded as\nResidential mortgage and Commercial real\nestate related income. The majority of direct\norigination costs are recorded in Personnel\nexpense. The fair value of these loans is\nderived from observable current market prices\nwhen available and includes loan servicing\nvalue. When observable market prices are not\navailable, the Company uses judgment and\nestimates fair value using internal models\nthat reflect assumptions consistent with those\nthat would be used by a market participant in\nestimating fair value.\nFirst lien residential mortgage LHFS are\ntransferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE\nsecuritization transactions, whereby the loans\nare exchanged for cash or securities that are\nreadily redeemable for cash with servicing\nrights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale\nof residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at\ninception of the associated interest rate lock\ncommitments and reflect the change in value of\nthe loans resulting from changes in interest\nrates from the time the Company enters into\ninterest rate lock commitments with borrowers\nuntil the loans are sold, adjusted for pull\nthrough rates and excluding hedge transactions\ninitiated to mitigate this market risk.\nCommercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and\nFHLMC and the Company also issues and sells\nGNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured\nloans. The loans and securities are exchanged\nfor cash with servicing rights retained. Gains\nand losses on sales of residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans are included in\nResidential mortgage and Commercial real\nestate income, respectively.\nLHFS also includes specifically identified\nloans where management has committed to a\nformal plan of sale and the loans are\navailable for immediate sale. These loans are\ngenerally recorded at LOCOM. Origination fees\nand costs for such loans are capitalized in\nthe basis of the loan and are included in the\ncalculation of realized gains and losses upon\nsale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized losses\nresulting from changes in fair value and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nof the loans are classified as Noninterest\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The fair value of these loans is\nestimated using observable market prices when\navailable, but may also incorporate\nconsideration of other unobservable inputs\nsuch as indicative bids, broker price opinions\nor other information derived from internal or\nexternal data sources.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may\ntransfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At\nthe time of transfer, any credit losses are\nsubject to charge-off in accordance with the\nCompany\u2019s policy and are recorded as a\nreduction in the ALLL. Any subsequent losses,\nincluding those related to interest rate or\nliquidity-related valuation adjustments are\nrecorded as a component of Noninterest income\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s LHFS,\nsee \"Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.\"\n               Truist Financial Corporation 95\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company's accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased, and if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that at the date of acquisition there is\nmore than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\nOriginated Loans and Leases\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture or until maturity or payoff are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest method.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date.\nFair values for purchased loans are based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology that\nconsiders credit loss expectations, market\ninterest rates and other market factors such\nas liquidity from the perspective of a market\nparticipant. Loans are grouped together\naccording to similar characteristics and\ntreated in the aggregate when applying various\nvaluation techniques. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninternal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, purchased loans are\nevaluated upon acquisition and classified as\neither PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality, including but not limited to risk\ngrades, delinquency, nonperforming status,\nprevious troubled debt restructurings or\nbankruptcies and other qualitative factors\nthat indicate deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination.\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans are amortized or accreted to Interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\ninterest-only loans and loans associated with\na revolving commitment. In the event of\nprepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums\nare recognized in Interest and fees on loans\nand leases.\n96 Truist Financial Corporation\nTDRs\nModifications to a borrower's debt agreement\nare considered TDRs if a concession is granted\nfor economic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower's financial difficulties that\notherwise would not be considered. TDRs are\nundertaken to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan and may take the form of\nmodifications that result in the stated\ninterest rate of the loan being lower than the\ncurrent market rate for new debt with similar\nrisk, other modifications to the structure of\nthe loan that fall outside of normal\nunderwriting policies and procedures, or in\ncertain limited circumstances, forgiveness of\nprincipal or interest. A restructuring that\nresults in only a delay in payments that is\ninsignificant is not considered an economic\nconcession. In accordance with the CARES Act,\nTruist implemented loan modification programs\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order\nto provide borrowers with flexibility with\nrespect to repayment terms. Payment relief\nassistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging\nprograms, along with certain other\nmodification strategies. The Company adopted\ncertain provisions of the CARES Act and other\nregulatory guidance that provide relief from\nthe requirement to apply TDR accounting to (1)\ncertain modifications of federally backed\nmortgages upon request from the borrower, and\n(2) certain modifications of other non-\nfederally backed mortgages for borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that were\nless than 30 days past due at December 31,\n2019. In other circumstances the Company\napplied TDR relief provided by the regulatory\nagencies for borrowers who received short-term\nmodifications as a result of COVID-19 and were\nless than 30 days past due at the time that\nthe Company's COVID-19 loan modification\nprogram was implemented, or for federally\nbacked loans, the modification was mandated by\nthe government in response to COVID-19.\nTDRs can be classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower will be\nable to repay the loan based on the modified\nterms. In circumstances where the TDR involves\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classifies these TDRs as nonperforming.\nThe decision to maintain a commercial TDR on\nperforming status is based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrower's\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation includes consideration of the\nborrower's current capacity to pay, which\namong other things may include a review of the\nborrower's current financial statements, an\nanalysis of cash flow available to pay debt\nobligations, and an evaluation of secondary\nsources of payment from the borrower and any\nguarantors. This evaluation also includes an\nevaluation of the borrower's current\nwillingness to pay, which may include a review\nof past payment history, an evaluation of the\nborrower's willingness to provide information\non a timely basis, and consideration of offers\nfrom the borrower to provide additional\ncollateral or guarantor support. The credit\nevaluation may also include review of cash\nflow projections, consideration of the\nadequacy of collateral to cover all principal\nand interest and trends indicating improving\nprofitability and collectability of\nreceivables.\nThe evaluation of mortgage and other consumer\nloans includes an evaluation of the client's\ndebt-to-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue and certain other client-specific\nfactors that impact the clients\u2019 ability to\nmake timely principal and interest payments on\nthe loan.\nTDR classification may be removed due to the\npassage of time if the loan: (i) did not\ninclude a forgiveness of principal or\ninterest, (ii) has performed in accordance\nwith the modified terms (generally a minimum\nof six months), (iii) was reported as a TDR\nover a year-end reporting period, and (iv)\nreflected an interest rate on the modified\nloan that was no less than a market rate at\nthe date of modification. TDR classification\nmay also be removed for an accruing loan upon\nthe occurrence of a subsequent non-\nconcessionary modification granted at market\nterms and within current underwriting\nguidelines.

The non-guaranteed balance,\nwhich ranges from 2-3%, is charged off once\nthe claim proceeds related to the guaranteed\nportion have been received.\n\n(6) Credit cards are generally not placed on\nnonperforming status, but are fully charged\noff at specified delinquency dates consistent\nwith regulatory guidelines.\n\nWhen commercial loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, a charge-off is\nrecorded, as applicable, to decrease the\ncarrying value of such loans to the estimated\nrecoverable amount. Consumer and credit card\nloans are subject to charge-off at a specified\ndelinquency date consistent with regulatory\nguidelines.\n\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\n\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus. The Company has deferred interest\nincome recognition on the estimated\nuncollectible portion of accrued interest on\nloans that were provided payment relief\nassistance in connection with the CARES Act.\n\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value less\nestimated cost to sell and subsequently\ncarried at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value equals fair value\nless estimated selling costs. Any excess of\ncost over net realizable value at the time of\nforeclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are\nsubject to periodic revaluations of the\ncollateral underlying impaired loans and\nforeclosed real estate. The periodic\nrevaluations are generally based on the\nappraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist's\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than six monthsold,\notherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition of these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \"Note 5. Loans and\nACL.\"\n\n98 Truist Financial Corporation\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from or added to the loans\u2019 amortized\ncost basis to present the net amount expected\nto be collected on loans. The entire amount of\nthe ACL is available to absorb losses on any\nloan category or lending-related commitment.\nLoan or lease balances deemed to be\nuncollectible are charged off against the\nALLL. Expected recoveries of amounts\npreviously charged off are incorporated into\nthe ALLL estimate, with such amounts capped at\nthe aggregate of amounts previously charged\noff. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to\nthe Provision for credit losses, which is\nreflected in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The RUFC is recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments; commercial, consumer\nand credit card. The expected credit loss\nmodels are generally developed one level below\nthe portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans are further disaggregated by\nsimilar risk characteristics, such as business\nsector, client type, funding type, type of\ncollateral, whether loan payments are\ninterest-only and whether interest rates are\nfixed or variable. Larger loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nor that are considered collateral-dependent\nare individually evaluated. For these loans,\nthe ALLL is determined through review of data\nspecific to the borrower and related\ncollateral, if any. Such estimates may be\nbased on current loss forecasts, an evaluation\nof the fair value of the underlying collateral\nor in certain circumstances the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest as described further\nbelow. The commercial portfolio segment models\nuse a risk rating approach to estimate the\nALLL. Truist may also consider specific\nenvironmental, social, and governance\nconsiderations in the risk rating methodology\nfor commercial loans. The consumer and credit\ncard models use a delinquency-based approach\nto estimate the ALLL. In addition to these\nquantitatively calculated components, the ALLL\nincludes qualitatively calculated components.\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic forecast data,\nportfolio composition and loan attributes as\nthe primary inputs. Loss estimates are\ninformed by historical loss experience\nadjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and\ncurrent and expected portfolio risk\ncharacteristics. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough contractual maturity unless the\nborrower has a right to renew that is not\ncancellable or it is reasonably expected that\nthe loan will be modified as a TDR.\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for enterprise-\nsanctioned macroeconomic forecast data,\nincluding the macroeconomic forecast data for\nuse in the ACL process. Forecasted economic\nconditions are developed using third party\nmacroeconomic forecast data across scenarios\nadjusted based on management\u2019s expectations\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years. Assumptions revert to\nlong term historic averages gradually over a\none year period. Macroeconomic forecast data\nused in estimating the expected losses vary by\nloan portfolio and include employment factors,\nestimated collateral values and market\nindicators as described by portfolio segment\nbelow. A qualitative allowance which\nincorporates management\u2019s judgement is also\nincluded in the estimation of expected future\nloan and lease losses, including qualitative\nadjustments in circumstances where the model\noutput is inconsistent with management\u2019s\nexpectations with respect to expected credit\nlosses. This allowance is used to adjust for\nlimitations in modeled results related to the\ncurrent economic conditions, and capture risks\nin the portfolio such as considerations with\nrespect to the impact of current economic\nevents, the outcomes of which are uncertain.\nThese events may include, but are not limited\nto, legislation that may directly or\nindirectly affect the banking industry and\neconomic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which\nTruist conducts business.\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL on January 1,\n2020, the ACL represented management\u2019s\nestimate of probable credit losses incurred in\nthe loan and lease portfolios and off-balance\nsheet lending commitments at the balance sheet\ndate. The estimation of the allowance for\ncredit losses prior to 2020 did not consider\nreasonable and supportable forecasts that\ncould have affected the collectability of the\nreported amounts.\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n               Truist Financial Corporation 99\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower's ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers' financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower's ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan's guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is reasonably\nassured. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management's   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting models are\nexpected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic forecast data across scenarios\nand current portfolio attributes as inputs.\nThe models forecast probability of default,\nexposure at default and loss given default by\ncorrelating certain macroeconomic forecast\ndata to historical experience. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the commercial\nportfolios include unemployment trends, U.S.\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates and property values.\n\nTruist's policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all nonperforming\nlending relationships and TDRs with an\noutstanding balance of $ 5million or more, as\nsuch lending relationships do not typically\nshare similar risk characteristics with\nothers. Individually evaluated reserves are\nbased on current forecasts, the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest rate or the value of\ncollateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories and other types of collateral.\n\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe majority of the ALLL related to the\nconsumer and credit card lending portfolios is\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness and sales channel. Consumer portfolio\nmodels are expected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic forecast data across scenarios\nand current portfolio attributes as inputs.\nThe models forecast probability of default,\nexposure at default and loss given default by\ncorrelating certain macroeconomic forecast\ndata to historical experience. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the consumer\nportfolios include unemployment trends, the\nprimary 30-year mortgage rate, home price\nindices and used car prices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination, and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and\nindirect other portfolios include secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used automobiles,\nboats and recreational vehicles. The student\nloan portfolio is composed of government\nguaranteed student loans and certain private\nstudent loans. The government guarantee\nmitigates substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. Private\nstudent loans were originated with a credit\nenhancement from a third-party which partially\nmitigates the Company\u2019s credit exposure.\nDuring 2020, the Company discontinued new\norigination of private student loans. The\ncredit card portfolio and other arrangements\nwithin the indirect other and residential home\nequity and direct portfolios are generally\nunsecured and are actively managed.\n\nTruist uses performing status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n\nThe ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is\nbased on analyses capturing the expected\ncredit losses and the impact of the concession\nover the remaining life of the asset.\n\n100 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nExpected recoveries for consumer and credit\ncard loans are included in the estimation of\nthe ALLL based on historical experience.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises, equipment, finance leases and\nleasehold improvements are stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed\nprimarily using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the related\nassets and is recorded within the\ncorresponding Noninterest expense categories\non the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the\nimprovements\u2019 estimated useful lives or the\nlease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived\nasset or asset group, including premises and\nequipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of a long-\nlived asset exceeds its fair value based on\nthe undiscounted cash flows.\nLessee operating and finance leases\nTruist has operating and finance leases for\ndata centers, corporate offices, branches,\nretail centers, and certain equipment, and\ndetermines if an arrangement is a lease at\ninception. Operating leases with an original\nlease term in excess of one year are included\nin Other assets and Other liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases\nare included in Premises and equipment and\nLong-term debt in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating and finance lease assets and\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement\ndate based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. Operating lease\ncosts are recorded in Net occupancy expense or\nEquipment expense based on the underlying\nasset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate\nin determining the present value of lease\npayments when readily determinable, and a\ncollateralized incremental borrowing rate when\nan implicit rate is not available. Lease terms\nconsider options to extend or terminate based\non the determination of whether such renewal\nor termination options are deemed reasonably\ncertain.\nLease agreements that contain non-lease\ncomponents are generally accounted for as a\nsingle lease component. Variable costs, such\nas maintenance expenses, property and sales\ntaxes, association dues and index based rate\nincreases, are expensed as they are incurred.\nThe impairment policy for a ROU asset is\ndiscussed within the Premises and Equipment\nsection above.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nLife insurance policies on certain current and\nformer directors, officers and teammates, for\nwhich Truist is the owner and beneficiary are\nstated at the cash surrender value within\nOther assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Changes in cash surrender value and\nproceeds from insurance benefits are recorded\nin Income from bank-owned life insurance in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified affordable housing investments.\nIn computing the provision for income taxes,\nthe Company evaluates the technical merits of\nits income tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The deferral method of accounting is\nused on investments that generate investment\ntax credits, such that the investment tax\ncredits are recognized as a reduction to the\nrelated investment. Additionally, the Company\nrecognizes all excess tax benefits and\ndeficiencies on employee share-based payments\nas a component of the Provision for income\ntaxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. These tax effects, generally\ndetermined upon the exercise of stock options\nor vesting of restricted stock, are treated as\ndiscrete items in the period in which they\noccur. The provision for income taxes does not\nreflect the tax effects of unrealized gains\nand losses and other income and expenses\nrecorded in AOCI. For additional information\nrelated to the Company's unrealized gains and\nlosses, see \"Note 13. AOCI.\"\nDTAs and DTLs result from differences between\nthe timing of the recognition of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes\nand for income tax purposes. These deferred\nassets and liabilities are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected\nto apply in the periods in which the DTAs or\nDTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent\nchanges in the tax laws require adjustment to\nthese deferred assets and liabilities with the\ncumulative effect included in the Provision\nfor income taxes for the period in which the\nchange is enacted. A valuation allowance is\nrecognized for a DTA, if based on the weight\nof available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that some portion or all of the DTA will\nnot be realized.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 101\nInterest and penalties related to the\nCompany\u2019s tax positions are recognized as a\ncomponent of the Provision for income taxes in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nactivities related to income taxes, see \"Note\n14. Income Taxes.\"\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company records derivative contracts at\nfair value in Other assets and Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends upon whether or\nnot it has been designated in a formal,\nqualifying hedging relationship. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives not designated\nin a hedging relationship are recognized\nwithin Noninterest income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. This includes\nderivatives that the Company enters into in a\ndealer capacity to facilitate client\ntransactions and as a risk management tool to\neconomically hedge certain identified risks\nassociated with assets carried at fair value\nsuch as MSRs, along with certain interest rate\nlock commitments on residential mortgage and\ncommercial loans that are a normal part of the\nCompany\u2019s operations. The Company also\nevaluates contracts, such as brokered deposits\nand debt, to determine whether any embedded\nderivatives are required to be bifurcated and\nseparately accounted for as freestanding\nderivatives.\nCertain derivatives used as risk management\ntools are designated as accounting hedges and\nare used to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates or other identified\nmarket risks. The Company prepares written\nhedge documentation for all derivatives which\nare designated as hedges of (i) changes in the\nfair value of a recognized asset or liability\n(fair value hedge) attributable to a specified\nrisk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as\nthe variability of cash flows to be received\nor paid related to a recognized asset or\nliability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge\ndocumentation includes identification of,\namong other items, the risk management\nobjective, hedging instrument, hedged item and\nmethodologies for assessing and measuring\nhedge effectiveness, along with support for\nmanagement\u2019s assertion that the hedge will be\nhighly effective. Methodologies related to\nhedge effectiveness include (i) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the cash\nflows of the actual derivative and\nhypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the fair\nvalues of the actual derivative and the hedged\nitem.\nFor designated hedging relationships, the\nCompany generally performs subsequent\nassessments of hedge effectiveness using a\nqualitative approach.\nBelow is a summary of the cash flow and fair\nvalue hedge programs utilized by Truist:\n

Company to risk that\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract\ndoes not perform as expected. The Company\nmanages its exposures to counterparty credit\nrisk associated with derivatives by entering\ninto transactions with counterparties with\ndefined exposure limits based on their credit\nquality and in accordance with established\npolicies and procedures. All counterparties\nare reviewed regularly as part of the\nCompany\u2019s credit risk management practices and\nappropriate action is taken to adjust the\nexposure limits to certain counterparties as\nnecessary. The Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions are generally governed by ISDA\nagreements or other legally enforceable\nindustry standard master netting agreements.\nIn certain cases and depending on the nature\nof the underlying derivative transactions,\nbilateral collateral agreements are also\nutilized.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject\nto OTC derivative clearing requirements, which\nrequire certain derivatives to be cleared\nthrough central clearing houses. These\nclearing houses require the Company to post\ninitial and variation margin to mitigate the\nrisk of non-payment, the latter of which is\nreceived or paid daily based on the net asset\nor liability of the contracts. The Company\napplies settlement to market treatment for the\ncash collateralizing derivative contracts with\ncertain centrally cleared counterparties.\nDerivative balances with these counterparties\nare considered settled by the collateral, and\nthe implementation of the settlement to market\ntreatment was applied based on the effective\ndate of rulebook changes made by the\napplicable counterparties.\n\nWhen the Company has more than one outstanding\nderivative transaction with a single\ncounterparty, and there exists a legal right\nof setoff with that counterparty, the Company\nconsiders its exposure to the counterparty to\nbe the net fair value of its derivative\npositions with that counterparty. If the net\nfair value is positive, then the corresponding\nasset value also reflects cash collateral\nheld. The Company offsets derivative\ntransactions with a single counterparty as\nwell as any cash collateral paid to and\nreceived from that counterparty for derivative\ncontracts that are subject to ISDA or other\nlegally enforceable netting arrangements and\nmeet accounting guidance for offsetting\ntreatment.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nderivative activities, see \"Note 18. Fair\nValue Disclosures\" and \"Note 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\"\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the\nfair value of net assets acquired (including\nidentifiable intangibles) in transactions\naccounted for as business combinations. Truist\nallocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s)\nthat are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the business combination.\nThe goodwill of each reporting unit is\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis as\nof October 1 or more often if events or\ncircumstances indicate that it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying value. If, after\nassessing all relevant events or\ncircumstances, Truist concludes that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value,\nthen an impairment test is required. Truist\nmay also elect to bypass the qualitative\nassessment and proceed directly to the\nimpairment test. In the quantitative test, the\nfair value of a reporting unit is compared to\nthe carrying value of the reporting unit. If\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is greater\nthan the carrying value, then there is no\nimpairment. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying value, then an impairment loss is\nrecorded for the amount that the carrying\nvalue exceeds the fair value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill assigned to the\nreporting unit. The quantitative impairment\ntest estimates the fair value of the reporting\nunits using the income approach and the market\napproach. The income approach utilizes a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis. The market\napproach utilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples and\nconsiders a market control premium associated\nwith cost synergies and other cash flow\nbenefits that arise from obtaining control\nover a reporting unit.\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates and applicable\nvaluation multiples based on comparable public\ncompany information. Truist also assesses the\nreasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting units by comparison to\nits market capitalization over a reasonable\nperiod of time, including consideration of\nhistoric bank control premiums and the current\nmarket.\nCDI and other intangible assets include\npremiums paid for acquisitions of core\ndeposits and other identifiable intangible\nassets. Intangible assets other than goodwill,\nwhich are determined to have finite lives, are\namortized over their useful lives, based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits received. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nactivities related to goodwill and other\nintangibles, see \"Note 7. Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets.\"\n              Truist Financial Corporation 103\nMSRs\nTruist has two classes of MSRs for which it\nseparately manages the economic risks:\nresidential and commercial. Both classes of\nMSRs are accounted for primarily at fair value\nwith changes in fair value recorded in\nResidential mortgage income and Commercial\nreal estate related income on the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. The fair value of\nservicing rights is impacted by a variety of\nfactors, including prepayment assumptions,\ndiscount rates, delinquency rates,\ncontractually-specified servicing fees,\nservicing costs, and underlying portfolio\ncharacteristics. These risks are hedged with\nvarious derivative instruments that are\nintended to mitigate the income statement\neffect to changes in fair value. The\nunderlying assumptions and estimated values\nare corroborated by values received from\nindependent third parties and comparisons to\nmarket transactions. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s servicing rights,\nsee \"Note 8. Loan Servicing.\"\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Depending on the nature of the asset or\nliability, the Company uses various valuation\ntechniques and assumptions when estimating\nfair value. The Company classifies inputs used\nin valuation techniques within the fair value\nhierarchy discussed in \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nWhen measuring assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue, the Company considers the principal or\nmost advantageous market in which it would\ntransact and considers assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset\nor liability. Assets and liabilities that are\nrequired to be measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis include trading securities,\nderivative instruments, AFS securities, and\ncertain other equity securities. Assets and\nliabilities that the Company has elected to\nmeasure at fair value on a recurring basis\ninclude trading loans, loans originated to be\nsold and classified as LHFS, and residential\nand commercial MSRs. Other assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnon-recurring basis, such as when assets are\nevaluated for impairment, the basis of\naccounting is lower of cost or market, or for\ndisclosure purposes. Examples of these non-\nrecurring fair value measurements include\ncertain LHFS and loans and leases held for\ninvestment, OREO, certain cost or equity\nmethod investments, and intangible and long-\nlived assets. For additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s valuation of assets and\nliabilities held at fair value, see \"Note 18.\nFair Value Disclosures.\"\nEquity-Based Compensation\n\nTruist maintains various equity-based\ncompensation plans that provide for the\ngranting of RSAs, RSUs and PSUs to selected\nteammates and directors. Truist values share-\nbased awards at the grant date fair value and\nrecognizes the expense over the requisite\nservice period taking into account retirement\neligibility. Compensation expense is\nrecognized in Personnel expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures\nare recognized as they occur. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation plans, see \"Note 15. Benefit\nPlans.\"\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions.\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure\nthe pension and postretirement benefit\nobligations is set by reference to a high\nquality corporate bond yield curve and the\nindividual characteristics of the plan such as\nprojected cash flow patterns and payment\ndurations. The expected long-term rate of\nreturn on assets is based on the expected\nreturns for each major asset class in which\nthe plan invests, adjusted for the weight of\neach asset class in the target mix.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCompany recognizes two primary types of\nrevenue in its Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, Interest income and Noninterest\nincome. The Company\u2019s principal source of\nrevenue is interest income from loans and\nsecurities, which is recognized on an accrual\nbasis using the effective interest method. For\ninformation on the Company\u2019s policies for\nrecognizing interest income on loans and\nsecurities, see the \"Loans and Leases,\"\n\"LHFS,\" \"Trading Activities,\" and \"Investment\nSecurities\" sections within this Note.\nNoninterest income includes revenue from\nvarious types of transactions and services\nprovided to clients. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from contracts with customers as\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nPerformance obligations are typically\nsatisfied in one year or less. Truist elected\nthe practical expedient to expense the\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract when\nincurred when the amortization period is one\nyear or less. As of December 31, 2020 and\n2019, remaining performance obligations\nconsisted primarily of insurance and\ninvestment banking services for contracts with\nan original expected length of one year or\nless.\n104 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInsurance income\n\nInsurance commissions are received on the sale\nof insurance products as agent or broker, and\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time upon\nthe placement date of the insurance policies,\nrepresenting the Company\u2019s related performance\nobligations. Payment is normally received\nwithin the policy period. In addition to\nplacement, Truist also provides insurance\npolicy related risk management services. The\nCompany\u2019s execution of these risk management\nservices represents its performance\nobligations. Revenue is recognized over time\nas these services are provided. Performance-\nbased commissions are recognized when received\nor earlier when, upon consideration of past\nresults and current conditions, the revenue is\ndeemed not probable of reversal. Insurance\ncommissions are included in the IH operating\nsegment. Refer to \"Note 21. Operating\nSegments\" for information on segment results.\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues include\nService charges on deposits, Wealth management\nincome, Card and payment related fees, and\nInvestment banking income. Revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time when the\ntransactions occur or over time as services\nare performed over primarily monthly or\nquarterly periods. Payment is typically\nreceived in the period the transactions occur\nor, in some cases, within 90 days of the\nservice period. Fees may be fixed or, where\napplicable, based on a percentage of\ntransaction size or managed assets. These\nrevenues, and their relationship to the\nCompany\u2019s operating segments, are further\ndescribed by type below. Refer to \"Note 21.\nOperating Segments\" for information on segment\nresults.\n\nService charges on deposits include account\nmaintenance, cash and treasury management,\nwire transfers, ATM, overdraft and other\ndeposit-related fees. The Company\u2019s execution\nof the services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. Each\nof these performance obligations are either\nsatisfied over time or at a point in time as\nthe services are provided to the client. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. Payments for services provided are\neither withdrawn from client accounts as\nservices are rendered or in the billing period\nfollowing the completion of the service. The\ntransaction price for each of these fees is\nbased on the Company\u2019s predetermined fee\nschedules. Service charges on deposits are\nrecognized in the CB&W and C&CB operating\nsegments.\n\nWealth management income includes trust and\ninvestment management income, retail\ninvestment and brokerage services, and\ninvestment advisory and other specialty wealth\nmanagement fees. The Company\u2019s execution of\nthese services represents its related\nperformance obligations. The Company generally\nrecognizes trust and investment management and\nadvisory revenue over time as services are\nrendered based on either a percentage of the\nmarket value of the assets under management or\nadvisement, or fixed based on the services\nprovided to the client. Fees are generally\nswept from the client\u2019s account either in\nadvance of or in arrears based on the prior\nperiod\u2019s asset balances under management or\nadvisement. The Company also offers selling\nand distribution services and earns\ncommissions through the sale of annuity and\nmutual fund products, acting as agent in these\ntransactions and recognizing revenue at a\npoint in time when the client enters into an\nagreement with the product carrier. The\nCompany may also receive trailing commissions\nand 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and\nannuity products and recognizes this revenue\nin the period earned. Retail trade execution\ncommissions are earned and recognized on the\ntrade date with payment on the settlement\ndate. Wealth management income is included in\nthe CB&W operating segment.\n\nCard and payment related fees include\ninterchange fees from credit and debit cards,\nmerchant acquirer revenue and other card\nrelated services. Interchange fees are earned\nby the Company each time a request for payment\nis initiated by a client at a merchant for\nwhich the Company transfers the funds on\nbehalf of the client. Interchange rates are\nset by the payment network and are based on\npurchase volumes and other factors.\nInterchange fees are received daily and\nrecognized at a point in time when the card\ntransaction is processed, which represents the\nCompany\u2019s related performance obligation. The\nCompany is considered an agent of the client\nand incurs costs with the payment network to\nfacilitate the interchange with the merchant;\ntherefore, the related payment network expense\nis recognized as a reduction of card fees.\nTruist also offers rewards and/or rebates to\nits client based on card usage. The costs\nassociated with these programs are recognized\nas a reduction of card fees. Card and payment\nrelated fees are recognized in the CB&W and\nC&CB operating segments.\n\nInvestment banking and trading income includes\nsecurities underwriting fees, advisory fees,\nloan syndication fees, and trade execution\nservices revenue. Underwriting fees are earned\non the trade date when the Company, as a\nmember of an underwriting syndicate, purchases\nthe securities from the issuer and sells the\nsecurities to third party investors. Each\nmember of the syndicate is responsible for\nselling its portion of the underwriting and is\nliable for the proportionate costs of the\nunderwriting; therefore, the Company\u2019s portion\nof underwriting revenue and expense is\npresented gross within noninterest income and\nnoninterest expense. The transaction price is\nbased on a percentage of the total transaction\namount and payments are settled shortly after\nthe trade date. Fees for merger and\nacquisition advisory services, including\nvarious activities such as business valuation,\nidentification of potential targets or\nacquirers, and the issuance of fairness\nopinions, are generally earned and recognized\nby the Company when performance obligations\nare satisfied. The Company\u2019s execution of the\nadvisory services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. The transaction price is based on\ncontractually specified terms agreed upon with\nthe client for each advisory service. Loan\nsyndication fees are typically recognized at\nthe closing of a loan syndication transaction.\nRevenue related to corporate trade execution\nservices is earned and recognized on the trade\ndate with payment on the settlement date.\nInvestment banking and trading income is\nincluded in the C&CB operating segment.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 105\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during each period.

The Merger\nwas accounted for as a business combination.\nAccordingly, the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were recorded at their\nfair values as of the Merger date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nacquired assets and liabilities are subject to\nadjustment until all necessary information\nrelated to the valuation process has been\nreceived. Adjustments were finalized within\none year of the closing date of the Merger.\nImmaterial amounts of the intangible assets\nrecognized are deductible for income tax\npurposes.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation\nof Merger consideration to the fair value of\nthe identifiable tangible and intangible\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed of\nSunTrust as of December 6, 2019:\n                                              \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)             UPB       Fair Value  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Fair value                                  \n  of Merger                    $      33,547  \n  considerat\u2026                                 \n  Assets                                      \n  Cash and                                    \n  due from                             1,621  \n  banks                                       \n  Interest-b\u2026                                 \n  deposits                             4,668  \n  with banks                                  \n  Securities                                  \n  borrowed or                                 \n  purchased                            1,191  \n  under                                       \n  resale                                      \n  agreements                                  \n  Trading                              5,710  \n  assets                                      \n  AFS                                 30,986  \n  securities                                  \n  LHFS                                 3,752  \n  Loans and                                   \n  leases:                                     \n  Commercial                                  \n  and            $   68,687           67,101  \n  industrial                                  \n  CRE                 9,509            9,357  \n  Commercial          2,136            2,096  \n  Constructi\u2026                                 \n  Commercial          3,967            3,743  \n  Leases                                      \n  Mortgage           28,191           27,180  \n  Loans                                       \n  Home Equity                                 \n  and Direct         15,917           15,628  \n  Lending                                     \n  Indirect           12,373           12,203  \n  Auto                                        \n  Indirect            4,678            4,445  \n  Other                                       \n  Student             6,867            6,657  \n  Lending                                     \n  Credit Card         2,518            2,497  \n  PCI                 3,652            3,126  \n  Total loans    $  158,495          154,033  \n  and leases                                  \n  Premises                                    \n  and                                  1,496  \n  equipment                                   \n  CDI and                                     \n  other                                2,734  \n  intangible                                  \n  assets                                      \n  MSRs                                 1,605  \n  Other                               13,646  \n  assets                                      \n  Total                              221,442  \n  assets                                      \n  Liabilities                                 \n  and Equity                                  \n  Deposits                          -170,633  \n  Short-term                          -6,837  \n  borrowings                                  \n  Long-term                          -19,484  \n  debt                                        \n  Other                               -5,011  \n  liabilities                                 \n  Total                             -201,965  \n  liabilities                                 \n  Noncontrol\u2026                           -108  \n  interest                                    \n  Less: Net                           19,369  \n  assets                                      \n  Goodwill                     $      14,178  \n                                              \nThe following is a description of the methods\nused to determine the fair values of\nsignificant assets and liabilities.\n\nCash and cash equivalents; Interest-bearing\ndeposits with banks, and Federal Funds sold\nand securities purchased under resale\nagreements: The carrying amount of these\nassets is a reasonable estimate of fair value\nbased on the short-term nature of these\nassets.\n\n108 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTrading assets and AFS Securities: Fair values\nfor trading and AFS securities are based on\nquoted market prices, where available. If\nquoted market prices are not available, fair\nvalue estimates are based on observable inputs\nincluding quoted market prices for similar\ninstruments, quoted market prices that are not\nin an active market or other inputs that are\nobservable in the market. In the absence of\nobservable inputs, fair value is estimated\nbased on pricing models and/or discounted cash\nflow methodologies. The majority of AFS\nsecurities were priced by third party vendors\nwhereas trading securities are priced\ninternally. All securities are subject to IPV.\nTrading loans are valued primarily using\nquoted prices for similar instruments in\nactive markets or quoted prices for identical\nor similar instruments in markets that are not\nactive by a third party pricing service.\n\nLHFS: The fair value is primarily based on\nquoted market prices for securities backed by\nsimilar types of loans, adjusted for\nservicing, interest rate risk and credit risk.\n\nLoans and leases: Fair values for loans are\nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology\nthat considered credit loss expectations,\nmarket interest rates and other market factors\nsuch as liquidity from the perspective of a\nmarket participant. Loans are grouped together\naccording to similar characteristics and are\ntreated in the aggregate when applying various\nvaluation techniques. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninternal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate was\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof each loan. The discount rates used for\nloans are based on current market rates for\nnew originations of comparable loans and\ninclude adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows. All of\nthe merged loans were marked to fair value as\nof the Merger date and therefore, there was no\nallowance related to these loans.\n\nCDI: This intangible asset represents the\nvalue of the relationships with certain\ndeposit clients. The fair value was estimated\nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology\nthat gave appropriate consideration to\nexpected client attrition rates, cost of the\ndeposit base, reserve requirements, net\nmaintenance cost attributable to client\ndeposits and an estimate of the cost\nassociated with alternative funding sources.\nThe discount rates used for CDI assets are\nbased on current market rates. The CDI is\nbeing amortized over 10 years based upon the\nestimated economic benefits received.\n\nMSRs: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS\nvaluation model to project cash flows over\nmultiple interest rate scenarios, which are\ndiscounted at risk-adjusted rates. Commercial\nMSRs are valued using a cash flow valuation\nmodel that calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows.\n\nDeposits: The fair values used for the demand\nand savings deposits by definition equal the\namount payable on demand at the Merger date.\nThe fair values for time deposits are\nestimated using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation that applies interest rates\ncurrently being offered to the contractual\ninterest rates on such time deposits.\n\nShort-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of\nshort-term borrowings are reasonable estimates\nof fair value based on the short-term nature\nof these liabilities. The fair value of\nsecurities sold short is determined in the\nsame manner as trading securities.\n\nLong-term debt : The fair values of long-term\ndebt instruments are estimated based on quoted\nmarket prices for the instrument if available,\nor for similar instruments if not available,\nor by using discounted cash flow analyses,\nbased on current incremental borrowing rates\nfor similar types of instruments.\n\nPreferred stock: The fair values of preferred\nstock are estimated based on quoted market\nprices for the instruments.\n\nBranch Divestitures\n\nIn July 2020, Truist completed the divestiture\nof 30 branches to First Horizon Bank, a wholly\nowned subsidiary of First Horizon National\nCorporation, to satisfy regulatory\nrequirements in connection with the Merger.\nThe branches were located in North Carolina,\nVirginia and Georgia. There were $ 425million\nin loans and leases and $ 2.2billion in\ndeposits divested as part of this transaction.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nDuring 2020, Truist acquired several insurance\ncompanies, which resulted in $ 450million of\ngoodwill and $ 346million of identifiable\nintangible assets in the IH segment. The\nintangible assets are being amortized over a\nweighted average term of 15.4years based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits received.\nGoodwill of $ 171million and identifiable\nintangible assets of $ 160million are\ndeductible for tax purposes.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 109\n                                              \n  NOTE 3.

Securities borrowed are primarily\ncollateralized by corporate securities. The\nCompany borrows securities and purchases\nsecurities under agreements to resell as part\nof its securities financing activities. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and the related counterparty agree on\nthe amount of collateral required to secure\nthe principal amount loaned under these\narrangements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the total market value of\ncollateral held was $ 1.7billion and $\n1.4billion, of which $ 27million and $\n135million was repledged, respectively.

the Merger.\n\n(2) Balance is prior to the adoption of CECL.\n\n(3) Includes the adoption of CECL, the ALLL\nfor PCD acquisitions and other activity.\n\nThe adoption of CECL increased the ALLL $\n3.1billion. The following discussion\nsummarizes the changes in the factors that\ninfluenced Truist\u2019s ACL estimate.\n\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 2.1billion for\nyear ended December 31, 2020. The increase\nreflects the adoption of CECL and a more\npessimistic outlook with respect to future\neconomic conditions driven by the COVID-19\npandemic. The increase also reflects specific\nconsideration of the risks associated with\nexposures to certain industries most impacted\nby COVID-19, including oil and gas,\nhospitality, and lending to small businesses.\n\nThe consumer ALLL increased $ 2.0billion for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. The increase\nreflects the impact of CECL and the more\npessimistic outlook described above, with the\nlargest increases seen in the unsecured\nportfolios and the non-prime auto lending\nportfolio. These increases are partially\noffset by a decrease in outstanding loans in\nthe residential mortgage and residential home\nequity and direct portfolios.\n\nThe ALLL for credit card increased $\n237million for the year ended December 31,\n2020. The increase reflects the adoption of\nCECL and the more pessimistic outlook\ndescribed above, which was partially offset by\na reduction due to lower loan balances.\n\nThe RUFC increased $ 24million for the year\nended December 31, 2020. The increase reflects\nthe adoption of CECL and the more pessimistic\noutlook described above.\n\nTruist\u2019s ACL estimate represents management\u2019s\nbest estimate of expected credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolio,\nincluding unfunded commitments, at the balance\nsheet date. This estimate incorporates both\nquantitatively-derived output, as well as\nqualitative components that represent expected\nlosses not otherwise captured by the models.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macroeconomic forecast\ndata over a reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, which management has\ndetermined to be two years, followed by a\nreversion to long-term historical loss\nconditions over a one-year period. These\nmacroeconomic forecasts data include a number\nof key economic variables utilized in loss\nforecasting that include, but are not limited\nto, unemployment trends, US real GDP,\ncorporate credit spreads, rental rates,\nproperty values, the primary 30-year mortgage\nrate, home price indices and used car prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considered multiple third\nparty macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a\nrange of possible outcomes in order to capture\nuncertainty in the economic environment. The\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nDecember 31, 2020 included a GDP recovery to\npre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 with a\nstable unemployment rate through the middle of\n2021 followed by continued improvement through\nthe remainder of the reasonable and\nsupportable period.\n\n116 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses in\ntimes of rapidly changing macroeconomic\nforecasts. As a result, management believes\nthat the qualitative component of the ACL,\nwhich incorporates management\u2019s expert\njudgment related to expected future credit\nlosses, will continue to be a prominent factor\nin establishing the ACL for the foreseeable\nfuture. The December 31, 2020 ACL estimate\nincludes qualitative adjustments to address\nlimitations in modeled results with respect to\nforecasted economic conditions that are well\noutside of historic economic ranges used to\ndevelop the models and to give consideration\nto other risks in the portfolio, including the\nimpact of government relief programs, stimulus\nand client accommodations, that are not\ndirectly considered in the quantitative\nmodels.\nPCD Loan Activity\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is recognized in the\nALLL on the date of acquisition using the same\nmethodology as other loans held for\ninvestment.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The\nCompany had a gross liability of $ 12million\nand $ 11million for interest and penalties\nrelated to its UTBs at December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. The amount of gross\nexpense related interest and penalties on UTBs\nwas immaterial.\n\nThe Company files U.S. federal, state and\nlocal income tax returns. The Company's\nfederal income tax returns are no longer\nsubject to examination by the IRS for taxable\nyears prior to 2017. With limited exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to\nexamination by state and local taxing\nauthorities for taxable years prior to 2013.\nIt is reasonably possible that the liability\nfor unrecognized tax benefits could decrease\nby as much as $ 15million during the next 12\nmonths due to completion of tax authority\nexaminations and the expiration of statutes of\nlimitations. It is uncertain how much, if any,\nof this potential decrease will impact the\nCompany\u2019s effective tax rate.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 129\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Although technically unfunded\nplans, Rabbi Trusts and insurance policies on\nthe lives of certain of the covered employees\nare available to finance future benefits.\n\nThe Company's defined benefit plans obtained\nthrough the Merger were combined during 2020.\n\nThe following tables present a summary of the\nqualified and nonqualified defined benefit\npension plans.

Truist also has commitments to\nfund certain affordable housing investments\nand contingent liabilities related to certain\nsold loans.\n\nTax Credit and Certain Equity Investments\n\nThe Company invests in certain affordable\nhousing projects throughout its market area as\na means of supporting local communities.\nTruist receives tax credits related to these\ninvestments, for which the Company typically\nacts as a limited partner and therefore does\nnot exert control over the operating or\nfinancial policies of the partnerships. Truist\ntypically provides financing during the\nconstruction and development of the\nproperties; however, permanent financing is\ngenerally obtained from independent third\nparties upon completion of a project. Tax\ncredits are subject to recapture by taxing\nauthorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level.\nTruist's maximum potential exposure to losses\nrelative to investments in VIEs is generally\nlimited to the sum of the outstanding balance,\nfuture funding commitments and any related\nloans to the entity, exclusive of any\npotential tax recapture associated with the\ninvestments. Loans to these entities are\nunderwritten in substantially the same manner\nas the Company's other loans and are generally\nsecured.\n\nAdditionally, the Company invests in other\ncommunity development entities as a limited\npartner and/or a lender. The Company receives\ntax credits for its limited partner\ninvestments. The Company has determined that\nthe majority of the related partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these investments.\nTruist uses the equity method of accounting\nfor these investments.\n\nThe Company also invests in entities that\npromote renewable energy sources as a limited\npartner. Tax credits received for these\ninvestments are recorded as a reduction to the\ncarrying value of these investments. The\nCompany has determined that these renewable\nenergy tax credit partnerships are VIEs. The\nCompany has concluded that it is not the\nprimary beneficiary of these VIEs because it\ndoes not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIEs' financial performance and therefore, it\nis not required to consolidate these VIEs. The\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to\nthese investments is limited to its equity\ninvestments in these partnerships and any\nadditional unfunded equity commitments.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 133\nTruist has investments in and future funding\ncommitments related to private equity and\ncertain other equity method investments.

to\nbusinesses and consumers and have specified\nrates and maturity dates. Many of these\ncommitments also have adverse change clauses,\nwhich allow Truist to cancel the commitment\ndue to deterioration in the borrowers'\ncreditworthiness. The fair values of\ncommitments are estimated using the fees\ncharged to enter into similar agreements,\ntaking into account the remaining terms of the\nagreements and the present creditworthiness of\nthe counterparties. The fair values of\nguarantees and letters of credit are estimated\nbased on the counterparties' creditworthiness\nand average default rates for loan products\nwith similar risks. Consumer lending and\nrevolving credit commitments have an\nimmaterial fair value as Truist typically has\nthe unconditional ability to cancel such\ncommitments. Refer to \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures\" for additional disclosures on the\nRUFC.\n\nTruist has sold certain mortgage-related loans\nthat contain recourse provisions. These\nprovisions generally require Truist to\nreimburse the investor for a share of any loss\nthat is incurred after the disposal of the\nproperty. Truist also issues standard\nrepresentations and warranties related to\nmortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to \"Note 8.\nLoan Servicing\" for additional disclosures\nrelated to these exposures.\n\nLetters of credit and financial guarantees are\nunconditional commitments issued by Truist to\nguarantee the performance of a client to a\nthird party. These guarantees are primarily\nissued to support borrowing arrangements,\nincluding commercial paper issuance, bond\nfinancing and similar transactions. The credit\nrisk involved in the issuance of these\nguarantees is essentially the same as that\ninvolved in extending loans to clients and, as\nsuch, the instruments are collateralized when\nnecessary.\nThe following is a summary of selected\nnotional amounts of off-balance sheet\nfinancial instruments:\n                                              \n  December 31,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)               2020          2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Commitments to                              \n  extend,                                     \n  originate or      $  186,731    $  177,598  \n  purchase                                    \n  credit                                      \n  Residential                                 \n  mortgage loans           328           371  \n  sold with                                   \n  recourse                                    \n  CRE mortgages                               \n  serviced for                                \n  others                 9,019         8,676  \n  covered by                                  \n  recourse                                    \n  provisions                                  \n  Letters of             5,066         5,181  \n  credit                                      \n                                              \n134 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nDerivatives\n\nTruist enters into derivative contracts to\nmanage various financial risks. A derivative\nis a financial instrument that derives its\ncash flows, and therefore its value, by\nreference to an underlying instrument, index\nor referenced interest rate. Derivative\ncontracts are carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with the fair\nvalue representing the net present value of\nexpected future cash receipts or payments\nbased on market interest rates. For additional\ninformation on derivative instruments, see\n\"Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.\"\n\nTotal Return Swaps\n\nThe Company facilitates matched book TRS\ntransactions on behalf of clients, whereby a\nVIE purchases reference assets identified by a\nclient and the Company enters into a TRS with\nthe VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the\nclient. The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets. The TRS\ncontracts pass through interest and other cash\nflows on the reference assets to the third\nparty clients, along with exposing those\nclients to decreases in value on the assets\nand providing them with the rights to\nappreciation on the assets. The terms of the\nTRS contracts require the third parties to\npost initial margin collateral, as well as\nongoing margin as the fair values of the\nunderlying reference assets change.\n\nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses, and the right to receive\nbenefits, that could potentially be\nsignificant. At December 31, 2020, the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected\n$ 1.3billion of assets and $ 41million of\nother liabilities of the VIEs. At December 31,\n2019, the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet\nreflected $ 2.7billion of assets and $\n116million of other liabilities of the VIEs.\nAssets at December 31, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 include $ 1.3billion and $ 2.6billion in\ntrading loans, respectively. The activities of\nthe VIEs are restricted to buying and selling\nthe reference assets and the risks/benefits of\nany such assets owned by the VIEs are passed\nto the third party clients via the TRS\ncontracts. For additional information on TRS\ncontracts and the related VIEs, see \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments.\"\n\nOther Commitments\n\nTruist holds public funds in certain states\nthat do not require 100% collateralization on\npublic fund bank deposits. In these states,\nshould the failure of another public fund\ndepository institution result in a loss for\nthe public entity, the resulting\nuncollateralized deposit shortfall would have\nto be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon\nthe public deposits held by each bank within\nthe respective state) by the remaining\nfinancial institutions holding public funds in\nthat state. Truist monitors deposits levels\nrelative to the total public deposits held by\nall depository institutions within these\nstates. The likelihood that the Company would\nhave to perform under this guarantee is\ndependent on whether any financial\ninstitutions holding public funds default, as\nwell as the adequacy of collateral coverage.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Truist\nindemnifies its officers and directors to the\nfullest extent permitted by law against\nliabilities arising from pending litigation.\nTruist also issues standard representations\nand warranties in underwriting agreements,\nmerger and acquisition agreements, loan sales,\nbrokerage activities and other similar\narrangements. Counterparties in many of these\nindemnification arrangements provide similar\nindemnifications to Truist. Although these\nagreements often do not specify limitations,\nTruist does not believe that any payments\nrelated to these guarantees would materially\nchange the financial position or results of\noperations of Truist.\n\nAs a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to\nmaintain a minimum investment in capital\nstock. The board of directors of the FHLB can\nincrease the minimum investment requirements\nin the event it has concluded that additional\ncapital is required to allow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital requirements. Any\nincrease in the minimum investment\nrequirements outside of specified ranges\nrequires the approval of the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency. Because the extent of any\nobligation to increase Truist's investment in\nthe FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence\nof a future event, potential future\ninvestments in the FLHB stock are not\ndeterminable.\n\nThe Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation for trade comparisons, netting and\nsettlement of fixed income securities. As a\nGovernment Securities Division netting member,\nthe Company has a commitment to the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation to meet its\nfinancial obligations as a central\ncounterparty clearing house in the event the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation has\ninsufficient liquidity recourses through a\npotential committed liquidity resource\nrepurchase transaction. Any commitment would\nbe based on the Company\u2019s share of its\nliquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Truist does not believe that any\npayments related to these guarantees would\nmaterially change the financial position or\nresults of operations of Truist.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 135\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law. Assets pledged\nto the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable\nasset discounts when determining borrowing\ncapacity. The Company obtains secured\nfinancing and letters of credit from the FRB\nand FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of credit from\nthe FHLB can be used to secure various client\ndeposits, including public fund relationships.\nExcluding assets related to employee benefit\nplans, the majority of the agreements\ngoverning the pledged assets do not permit the\nother party to sell or repledge the\ncollateral. Additional assets were pledged to\nthe FRB of Richmond in the first quarter of\n2020 following the Merger. The following table\nprovides the total carrying amount of pledged\nassets by asset type.\n                                              \n  December 31,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)                2020         2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pledged             $  24,974    $  11,283  \n  securities                                  \n  Pledged loans:                              \n  FRB                    75,615       30,238  \n  FHLB                   69,994       80,816  \n  Unused borrowing                            \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB                    52,831       21,169  \n  FHLB                   52,274       37,303  \n                                              \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nTruist and/or its subsidiaries are routinely\nparties to numerous legal proceedings,\nincluding private, civil litigation and\nregulatory investigations, arising from the\nordinary conduct of its regular business\nactivities. The matters range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with multiple class members\nand can involve claims for substantial\namounts. Investigations involve both formal\nand informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThese legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration or investigation\nand may consist of a variety of claims,\nincluding common law tort and contract claims\nand statutory antitrust, securities and\nconsumer protection claims, and the ultimate\nresolution of any proceeding is uncertain and\ninherently difficult to predict. It is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters, if unfavorable, may be material to\nthe consolidated financial position,\nconsolidated results of operations, or\nconsolidated cash flows of Truist.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP\nfor contingencies, Truist establishes accruals\nfor legal matters when potential losses\nassociated with the actions become probable\nand the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. There is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the amounts that Truist\nhas accrued. Accruals for legal matter are\nbased on management\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel and others, as\nwarranted.\n\nThe Company\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, ranges\nfrom zeroto approximately $ 200million as of\nDecember 31, 2020. This estimated range is\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolves considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors. In\naddition, the matters underlying this\nestimated range will change from time to time,\nand actual losses may vary significantly from\nthis estimate. As a result, the Company does\nnot believe that an estimate of reasonably\npossible losses can be made for certain\nmatters. Such matters are not reflected in the\nrange provided here.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived. On October 6, 2017, the trial court\ngranted plaintiff's motion for class\ncertification and defined the class as \"Every\nGeorgia citizen who had or has one or more\naccounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July\n12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least\none overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting\nfrom an ATM or debit card transaction (the\n\"Transaction\"); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees\nas a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did\nnot receive a refund of those Fees\" and the\ngranting of a certified class was affirmed on\nappeal. On April 8, 2020, the Company filed a\nmotion seeking to narrow the scope of this\nclass and on May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed\nmotion to compel arbitration of the claims of\nsome of the class members. On February 9,\n2021, the trial court denied both motions as\npremature but held that the issues could be\nraised again after the conclusion of\ndiscovery, which is currently underway. The\nCompany believes that the claims are without\nmerit.\n\n136 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\n\nTruist Bank is subject to laws and regulations\nthat limit the amount of dividends it can pay.\nIn addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to various regulatory restrictions\nrelating to the payment of dividends,\nincluding requirements to maintain capital at\nor above regulatory minimums, and to remain\n\"well-capitalized\" under the prompt corrective\naction regulations.\n\nTruist is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements administered by the\nFederal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements. Under capital\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany must meet specific capital guidelines\nthat involve quantitative measures of assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated pursuant to regulatory\ndirectives. Truist's capital amounts and\nclassification also are subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings and other factors. Truist is\nin full compliance with these requirements.\nBanking regulations also identify five capital\ncategories for IDIs: well-capitalized,\nadequately capitalized, undercapitalized,\nsignificantly undercapitalized and critically\nundercapitalized. At December 31, 2020 and\n2019, Truist and Truist Bank were classified\nas \"well-capitalized,\" and management believes\nthat no events or changes have occurred\nsubsequent to year end that would change this\ndesignation.\n\nQuantitative measures established by\nregulation to ensure capital adequacy require\nTruist to maintain minimum ratios of CET1\nratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%,\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of\n8.0%, Tier 1 capital to average tangible\nassets (leverage ratio) of 4.0% and\nsupplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Truist\nis subject to a 2.7% SCB that became\napplicable on October 1, 2020. Truist Bank is\nsubject to a 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nThe SCB and capital conservation buffer are\namounts above the minimum levels designed to\nensure that banks remain well-capitalized,\neven in adverse economic scenarios.\n\nRisk-based capital ratios, which include CET1,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital, are\ncalculated based on regulatory guidance\nrelated to the measurement of capital and\nrisk-weighted assets.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) The leverage ratio is calculated using end\nof period Tier 1 capital and quarterly average\ntangible assets. The timing of the Merger\nimpacted the 4Q19 result.\n(2) Truist became subject to the supplementary\nleverage ratio as of January 1, 2020.\nAs an approved seller/servicer, Truist Bank is\nrequired to maintain minimum levels of\ncapital, as specified by various agencies,\nincluding the U.S. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, Truist Bank's\ncapital was above all required levels.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 137\n                                              \n  NOTE 18.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\" for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, investments totaling $\n314million have been excluded from the table\nabove as valued based on net asset value as a\npractical expedient.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nfor Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities\nthat are measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis.\n\nAvailable for Sale and Trading Securities:\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available-for-sale and trading\nportfolios. The Company uses prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes or recent\ntrades to estimate the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of AFS securities\nwere priced by third party vendors whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. The\nAFS securities and trading securities are\nsubject to IPV. Management independently\nevaluates the fair values of AFS Securities\nand trading securities through comparisons to\nexternal pricing sources, review of additional\ninformation provided by the pricing service\nand other third party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on any security sales to the\npricing information received from the pricing\nservice. Fair value measurements for trading\nsecurities are derived from observable market-\nbased information including, but not limited\nto, overall market conditions, recent trades,\ncomparable securities, broker quotes and\nFINRA\u2019s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\ndata when determining the value of a position.\nSecurity prices are also validated through\nactual cash settlement upon the sale of a\nsecurity.\n\nAs described by security type below,\nadditional inputs may be used, or some inputs\nmay not be applicable.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 139\nTrading loans: The Company has elected to\nmeasure trading loans at fair value. Trading\nloans are valued primarily using quoted prices\nfor similar instruments in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active by\na third party pricing service. Trading loans\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 loans held in connection with the Company's\ntrading business primarily consisting of\ncommercial and corporate leveraged loans;\n\n\u2022 SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government;\nand\n\n\u2022 loans made or acquired in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s TRS business.\n\nU.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities\nare valued using quoted prices in active over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\nGSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities\nconsist of debt obligations issued by HUD, the\nFHLB, and other agencies, as well as\nsecurities collateralized by loans that are\nguaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. Agency MBS includes pass-through\nsecurities and CMO issued by GSEs and U.S.\ngovernment agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and\nGNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by\nthe issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including benchmark TBA security\npricing and yield curves that were estimated\nbased on U.S. Treasury yields and certain\nfloating rate indices. The pricing matrices\nfor these securities may also give\nconsideration to pool-specific data supplied\ndirectly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using\nmarket-based pricing matrices that are based\non observable inputs including offers, bids,\nreported trades, dealer quotes and market\nresearch reports, the characteristics of a\nspecific tranche, market convention prepayment\nspeeds and benchmark yield curves as described\nabove.\n\nStates and political subdivisions: The\nCompany\u2019s investments in U.S. states and\npolitical subdivisions include obligations of\ncounty and municipal authorities and agency\nbonds, which are general obligations of the\nmunicipality or are supported by a specified\nrevenue source. Holdings are geographically\ndispersed, with no significant concentrations\nin any one state or municipality.\nAdditionally, all municipal obligations are\nhighly rated or are otherwise collateralized\nby securities backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the federal government. These\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer\nspreads, material event notices and benchmark\nyield curves.\n\nNon-agency MBS: No non-agency MBS were held as\nof December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019,\nNon-agency MBS in the trading portfolio\nincluded purchased interests in third party\nsecuritizations that have a high investment\ngrade rating, and the pricing matrices for\nthese securities were based on observable\ninputs including offers, bids, reported\ntrades, dealer quotes and market research\nreports, the characteristics of a specific\ntranche, market convention prepayment speeds\nand benchmark yield curves as described above;\nas such, these securities were classified as\nlevel 2. Non-agency MBS in the AFS securities\nportfolio included investments in Re-REMIC\ntrusts that primarily hold U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and non-agency MBS, which were\nvalued based on broker pricing models that use\nbaseline securities yields and tranche-level\nyield adjustments to discount cash flows using\nmarket convention prepayment speed and default\nassumptions. These investments were classified\nas level 3.\n\nCorporate and other debt securities: These\nsecurities consist primarily of corporate\nbonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds\nare senior and subordinated debt obligations\nof domestic corporations. The Company acquires\ncommercial paper that is generally short-term\nin nature and highly rated. These securities\nare valued based on a review of quoted market\nprices for similar assets as well as through\nthe various other inputs discussed previously.\n\nLHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are\noriginated to be sold to investors are carried\nat fair value. The fair value is primarily\nbased on quoted market prices for securities\nbacked by similar types of loans, adjusted for\nservicing, interest rate risk, and credit\nrisk. The changes in fair value of these\nassets are largely driven by changes in\ninterest rates subsequent to loan funding and\nchanges in the fair value of servicing\nassociated with the mortgage LHFS.\n\nMSRs: Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS\nvaluation model to project cash flows over\nmultiple interest rate scenarios and then are\ndiscounted at risk-adjusted rates. The model\nconsiders portfolio characteristics,\ncontractually specified servicing fees,\nprepayment assumptions, delinquency rates,\nlate charges, other ancillary revenue, costs\nto service and other economic factors. Fair\nvalue estimates and assumptions are compared\nto industry surveys, recent market activity,\nactual portfolio experience and, when\navailable, other observable market data.\nCommercial MSRs are valued using a cash flow\nvaluation model that calculates the present\nvalue of estimated future net servicing cash\nflows. The Company considers actual and\nexpected loan prepayment rates, discount\nrates, servicing costs and other economic\nfactors that are determined based on current\nmarket conditions. Refer to \"Note 8. Loan\nServicing\" for additional discussion.\n\n140 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities: The Company\nholds derivative instruments for both trading\nand risk management purposes. These include\nexchange-traded futures or option contracts,\nOTC swaps, options, forwards and interest rate\nlock commitments. The fair values of\nderivatives are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable assumptions for interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equity and credit.\nThe fair values of interest rate lock\ncommitments, which are related to mortgage\nloan commitments and are categorized as Level\n3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted\nfor commitments that are not expected to fund\nand include the value attributable to the net\nservicing fees. Funding rates are based on the\nCompany\u2019s historical data. The fair value\nattributable to servicing is based on\ndiscounted cash flows, and is impacted by\nprepayment assumptions, discount rates,\ndelinquency rates, contractually-specified\nservicing fees, servicing costs and underlying\nportfolio characteristics.\n\nEquity securities: Equity securities primarily\nconsist of exchange-traded securities and are\nvalued using quoted prices in active markets.\n\nPrivate equity investments: In many cases\nthere are no observable market values for\nthese investments and therefore management\nmust estimate the fair value based on a\ncomparison of the operating performance of the\ninvestee to multiples in the marketplace for\nsimilar entities. This analysis requires\nsignificant judgment, and actual values in a\nsale could differ materially from those\nestimated.\n\nSecurities sold short: Securities sold short\nrepresent debt securities sold short that are\nentered into as a hedging strategy for the\npurposes of supporting institutional and\nretail client trading activities. The fair\nvalue of securities sold short is determined\nin the same manner as trading securities.\nActivity for Level 3 assets and liabilities is\nsummarized below:\n                                              \n                                          P\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026       E\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       M\u2026       \u2026       I\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  3    $  4\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       9       71       \u2026       66  \n         5       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       91  \n         \u2014       \u2014       1\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         3       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       47  \n         \u2014       4        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2014       31       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014       1\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2014       -\u2026       \u2014       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014       1\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        2  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       27  \n         \u2014       \u2014       7\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $   \u2014  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $   \u2014  \n                         R\u2026       \u2026           \n                         m\u2026       \u2026           \n                 \u2026       i\u2026       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       a\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       i\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       r\u2026       \u2026           \n                 \u2026       e\u2026       \u2026           \n                         r\u2026       \u2026           \n                         i\u2026       \u2026           \n                                              \n              Truist Financial Corporation 141\nDuring 2020, Truist sold non-agency MBS\npreviously categorized as Level 3 that\nrepresented ownership interests in various\ntranches of Re-REMIC trusts. The Re-REMIC\ntranches did not have an active market and\ntherefore were categorized as Level 3.\n\nDuring 2020, as a result of a change in\ncontrol of the funds\u2019 manager, the Company\ndeconsolidated certain SBIC funds for which it\nhad previously concluded that it was the\nprimary beneficiary. Following the\ndeconsolidation, the investments in SBIC funds\nare valued based on net asset value per unit,\nas provided by the fund manager as a practical\nexpedient, which approximates the fair value,\nand have not been classified in the fair value\nhierarchy. The SBIC funds in which the Company\ninvests primarily focus on equity and\nsubordinated debt investments in privately-\nheld middle market companies. The majority of\nthese VIE investments are not redeemable and\ndistributions are received as the underlying\nassets of the funds liquidate. The timing of\ndistributions, which are expected to occur on\nvarious dates over the next 10 years, is\nuncertain and dependent on various events such\nas recapitalizations, refinance transactions\nand ownership changes among others. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, restrictions on the ability\nto sell the investments include, but are not\nlimited to, consent of a majority of members\nor general partner approval for transfer of\nownership. These investments are spread over\nnumerous privately-held middle market\ncompanies, and thus the sensitivity to a\nchange in fair value for any single investment\nis limited.\n\nRefer to \"Note 8. Loan Servicing\" for\nadditional information on valuation techniques\nand inputs for MSRs.\n\nFair Value Option\nThe following table details the fair value and\nUPB of LHFS that were elected to be measured\nat fair value.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, credit\ndefault swaps, risk participations and TRS.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nThe Company has entered into TRS contracts on\nloans. To mitigate its credit risk, the\nCompany typically receives initial margin from\nthe counterparty upon entering into the TRS\nand variation margin if the fair value of the\nunderlying reference assets deteriorates. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s TRS\ncontracts, see \"Note 16. Commitments and\nContingencies.\"\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors.

Additionally, OT&C\nhouses intercompany eliminations, including\nintersegment net referral fees and residual\ninterest rate risk after segment allocations\nhave taken place.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 149\nTruist emphasizes revenue growth by focusing\non client service, sales effectiveness and\nrelationship management along with an\norganizational focus on referring clients\nbetween businesses. The objective is to\nprovide Truist\u2019s entire suite of products to\nits clients with the end goal of providing\nclients the best financial experience in the\nmarketplace. To promote revenue growth,\nrevenues of certain products and services are\nreflected in the results of the segment\nproviding those products and services and are\nalso allocated to CB&W and C&CB. These\nallocated revenues between segments are\nreflected as net referral fees in noninterest\nincome and eliminated in OT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include, but are not limited to,\nthe items as detailed below.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax\nequivalent basis, related primarily to certain\ncommunity development investments. Recoveries\nfor these allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. If significant changes to management\nreporting methodologies take place, the impact\nof these changes is quantified and prior\nperiod information is revised, when\npracticable.\n\n150 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 151\n                                              \n  NOTE 22.

Company is\nrestricted. Federal law requires loans to the\nParent Company or its affiliates to be secured\nand at market terms and generally limits loans\nto the Parent Company or an individual\naffiliate to 10% of Truist Bank's unimpaired\ncapital and surplus. In the aggregate, loans\nto the Parent Company and all affiliates\ncannot exceed 20% of the bank's unimpaired\ncapital and surplus.\n\nDividend payments to the Parent Company by\nTruist Bank are subject to regulatory review\nand statutory limitations and, in some\ninstances, regulatory approval. In general,\ndividends from Truist Bank to the Parent\nCompany are limited by rules which compare\ndividends to net income for regulatory-defined\nperiods. Furthermore, dividends are restricted\nby regulatory minimum capital constraints.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 153\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 9A.

The\nCompany's internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP. Truist's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that (1) pertain\nto the maintenance of records, that in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and disposition of\nthe Company's assets; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit the preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP\nand that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with\nthe authorizations of Truist's management and\ndirectors; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company's assets that could\nhave a material impact on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate due to changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies and procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the\nparticipation of management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer, the Company conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the\ninternal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission, commonly referred to as\nthe \"COSO\" criteria. Based on this evaluation\nunder the COSO criteria, management concluded\nthat the internal control over financial\nreporting was effective as of December 31,\n2020.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated\nin their accompanying report, which expresses\nan unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes\nin Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this\nreport, the management of the Company, under\nthe supervision and with the participation of\nthe Company's Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, carried out an\nevaluation of the Company's disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that the\nCompany's disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective.\n\nThere was no change in the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 that has\nmaterially affected, or is likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n\n154 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 15.
