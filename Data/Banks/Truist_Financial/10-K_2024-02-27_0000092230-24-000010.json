In addition, management has made\nsignificant investments in recent years to\ndevelop Truist\u2019s digital platform and believes\nthat its mobile and online applications are\ncompetitive in meeting clients\u2019 expectations.\nLegislative, regulatory, economic, and\ntechnological changes, as well as continued\nconsolidation within the industry, could\nresult in increased competition from new and\nexisting market participants. Truist\u2019s\nsubsidiaries compete actively with national,\nregional, and local financial services\nproviders, including banks, thrifts, credit\nunions, investment advisers, asset managers,\nsecurities brokers and dealers, private-equity\nfunds, hedge funds, mortgage-banking\ncompanies, finance companies, financial\ntechnology companies, and insurance companies.\nThe ability of non-banking entities, including\nfinancial technology companies, to provide\nfinancial products and services directly as\nwell as indirectly through partnerships has\nincreased competition.\n\nMany of our competitors have substantial\npositions nationally or in the markets in\nwhich we operate. Some also have greater\nscale, financial and operational resources,\ninvestment capacity, and brand recognition.\nOur competitors may be subject to different\nand, in some cases, less stringent\nlegislative, regulatory, and supervisory\nregimes than ours. A range of competitors\ndiffer from us in their strategic and tactical\npriorities and, for example, may be willing to\nsuffer meaningful financial losses in the\npursuit of disruptive innovation and client\ngrowth or to accept more aggressive business,\ncompliance, and other risks in the pursuit of\nhigher returns and market valuations.\nCompetition affects every aspect of our\nbusiness, including product and service\nofferings and features, rates, pricing and\nfees, credit limits, and client service.\nSuccessfully competing in our markets also\ndepends on our ability to innovate, to invest\nin technology and infrastructure, to execute\ntransactions reliably and efficiently, to\nmaintain and enhance our reputation, and to\nattract, retain, and motivate talented\nemployees, all while effectively managing\nrisks and expenses. We expect that competition\nwill only intensify in the future.\n                                              \n  General Business Development                \n                                              \nTruist seeks to satisfy all of its clients\u2019\nfinancial needs, enabling the Company to grow\nand diversify its sources of revenue and\nprofitability. Truist\u2019s long-term strategy\nprimarily encompasses organically growing and\ndeepening client relationships across its core\nand profitable businesses.\n                                              \n  Merger and Acquisition Strategy             \n                                              \nThe Company operates a diverse set of business\nlines nationally, with strong market shares\nconcentrated in high growth markets in the\nSoutheast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Truist\nwill continue to perform the appropriate due\ndiligence on potential strategic mergers and\nacquisitions to enhance growth, when market\nconditions, business objectives,\nprofitability, impact to capital, and market\nshare considerations align to create favorable\nopportunities. Although mergers and\nacquisitions are not a top capital\ndistribution priority for Truist, the Company\nwill continue to assess future opportunities,\nwhich may include financial services\nbusinesses that strengthen Truist\u2019s\ncapabilities, and banks that enhance Truist\u2019s\nmarket position.\n\nTruist\u2019s merger and acquisition strategy\nfocuses on meeting the following criteria:\n\n\u2022 the merger or acquisition must be\nstrategically attractive in that it:\n\n\u25e6 enhances scale and increases revenue via\nexpanded markets and/or products;\n\n\u25e6 improves the client experience; and\n\n\u25e6 solidifies Truist\u2019s position within the\nfuture of banking;\n\n\u2022 the organization must be a good fit with\nTruist\u2019s culture;\n\n\u2022 associated risks must be identified and\nmitigation plans put in place, such that any\nresidual risks fall within Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite; and\n\n\u2022 the transaction must meet Truist\u2019s financial\ncriteria.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 5\n                                              \n  Regulatory and Supervisory Considerations   \n                                              \nWe are subject to significant regulatory\nframeworks that affect the products and\nservices that we may offer and the manner in\nwhich we may offer them, the risks that we may\ntake, the ways in which we may operate, and\nthe corporate and financial actions that we\nmay take.\n\nWe are also subject to direct supervision and\nperiodic examinations by various governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations\nthat are charged with overseeing the kinds of\nbusiness activities in which we engage. These\nagencies and organizations generally have\nbroad authority and discretion in restricting\nand otherwise affecting our businesses and\noperations and may take formal or informal\nsupervisory, enforcement, and other actions\nagainst us when, in the applicable agency\u2019s or\norganization\u2019s judgment, our businesses or\noperations fail to comply with applicable law,\ncomport with safe and sound practices, or meet\nits supervisory expectations. We strive to\nmaintain constructive relationships with\nsupervisory authorities.\n\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework\napplicable to banking organizations is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and other customers, the DIF, the\nbroader economy, and the stability of the U.S.\nfinancial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and non-deposit\ncreditors. In addition to banking laws and\nregulations, Truist is subject to various\nother laws and regulations, all of which\ndirectly or indirectly affect the operations\nand management of Truist and its ability to\nmake distributions to shareholders.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations, and policies are continually\nunder review by Congress, state legislatures,\nand federal and state regulatory agencies. In\naddition to laws and regulations, state and\nfederal bank regulatory agencies may issue\npolicy statements, interpretive letters, and\nsimilar written guidance applicable to Truist\nand its subsidiaries. Any change in the\nstatutes, regulations, or regulatory policies\napplicable to Truist, including changes in\ntheir interpretation or implementation, could\nhave a material effect on its business or\norganization.\n\nThe scope of the laws and regulations, and the\nintensity of the supervision to which Truist\nis subject have increased in recent years,\ninitially in response to the financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors,\nincluding the banking turmoil in early 2023,\ntechnological factors, market changes, climate\nchange concerns, as well as increased scrutiny\nand possible denials of bank mergers and\nacquisitions by federal bank regulators.\nRegulatory enforcement and fines have also\nincreased across the banking and financial\nservices sector. Truist expects that its\nbusiness will remain subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws to which\nTruist is subject. These descriptions do not\nsummarize all possible or proposed changes in\nlaws or regulations and are not intended to be\na substitute for the related statutes or\nregulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  General                                     \n                                              \nAs a BHC, Truist is subject to regulation\nunder the BHCA and to regulation, examination,\nand supervision by the FRB. Truist Bank, a\nNorth Carolina state-chartered commercial bank\nthat is not a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, is subject to regulation, supervision,\nand examination by the NCCOB and the FDIC.\nTruist Bank and its affiliates are also\nsubject to examination by the CFPB for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws.\n\nTruist and certain of its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, including those that engage in\nderivatives transactions, securities\nunderwriting, market making, brokerage,\ninvestment advisory, and insurance activities,\nare subject to other federal and state laws\nand regulations, as well as supervision and\nexamination by other federal and state\nregulatory agencies and other regulatory\nauthorities, including the SEC, CFTC, FINRA,\nand NFA. Truist Bank is also subject to\nadditional state and federal laws, as well as\nvarious compliance regulations, which govern\nits activities, the investments it makes, and\nthe aggregate amount of loans that may be\ngranted to one borrower.\n\nExaminations by regulators consider not only\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations,\nand supervisory policies of the agency, but\nalso capital levels, asset quality, risk\nmanagement effectiveness, the ability and\nperformance of management and the board of\ndirectors, the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols, earnings, liquidity, and various\nother factors. Following examinations by\nbanking agencies, Truist and Truist Bank\nreceive supervisory findings and ultimately\nare assigned supervisory ratings. Examination\nreports, supervisory ratings, and other\nactions under this supervisory framework,\nwhich are considered confidential supervisory\ninformation, can impact the conduct, growth,\nand profitability of Truist\u2019s operations,\npossibly to a significant degree.\n\nUnder the FRB\u2019s Large Financial Institution\nRating System, component ratings are assigned\nfor capital planning, liquidity risk\nmanagement, and governance and controls. To be\nconsidered \u201cwell managed\u201d under this rating\nsystem, a firm must be rated \u201cbroadly meets\nexpectations\u201d or \u201cconditionally meets\nexpectations\u201d for each of its three component\nratings.\n\n6 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe results of examinations by any of Truist\u2019s\nfederal bank regulators can result in the\nimposition of significant limitations on\nTruist\u2019s activities and growth. These\nregulatory agencies generally have broad\nenforcement authority and discretion to impose\nrestrictions and limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity, including the\nimposition of substantial monetary penalties\nand nonmonetary requirements against a\nregulated entity where the relevant agency\ndetermines that the operations of the\nregulated entity or any of its subsidiaries\nfail to comply with applicable laws or\nregulations, are conducted in an unsafe or\nunsound manner, represent an unfair,\ndeceptive, abusive act or practice, or do not\nmeet supervisory expectations.\n                                              \n  FHC Regulation                              \n                                              \nTruist has elected to be treated as an FHC,\nwhich allows it to engage in a broader range\nof activities than would otherwise be\npermissible for a BHC, including activities\nthat are financial in nature or incidental\nthereto, such as securities underwriting or\nmerchant banking. While FHCs may engage in\ncertain acquisitions without prior approval of\nthe FRB, any acquisition over $10 billion in\nassets would require prior approval by the\nFRB. In order to maintain its status as an\nFHC, Truist and its affiliated IDI must be\nwell-capitalized and well-managed and Truist\nBank must have at least a satisfactory CRA\nrating. If the FRB determines that a FHC is\nnot well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB\nmay impose corrective capital and managerial\nrequirements on the FHC and may place\nlimitations on its ability to conduct certain\nbusiness activities that FHCs are generally\npermitted to conduct and its ability to make\ncertain acquisitions. If the failure to meet\nthese standards persists, a FHC may be\nrequired to divest its IDI subsidiaries or\ncease all activities other than those\nactivities that may be conducted by BHCs that\nare not FHCs. Furthermore, if an IDI\nsubsidiary of a FHC has not maintained a\nsatisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be\nable to commence any new financial activities\nor acquire a company that engages in such\nactivities, although the FHC would still be\nallowed to engage in activities closely\nrelated to banking and make investments in the\nordinary course of conducting banking\nactivities. Longstanding federal regulations\nrequire a FHC to act as a source of financial\nand managerial strength for its subsidiary\nbanks. In times of severe financial stress,\nthe obligation to serve as a source of\nstrength could cause Truist to commit\nsignificant resources to supporting Truist\nBank that otherwise would be available to\nTruist\u2019s creditors and shareholders.\n                                              \n  Resolution Planning                         \n                                              \nAs a Category III banking organization, Truist\nis required to submit to the FRB and FDIC a\nresolution plan every three years with\nsubmissions alternating between a full\nresolution plan and a targeted resolution\nplan. Upon review of the plan, the agencies\nmay jointly determine that a resolution plan\nis not credible or would not facilitate an\norderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode. If Truist were to fail to adequately\naddress deficiencies in a timely manner, it\nmay be subject to more stringent capital,\nleverage, or liquidity requirements, or\nrestrictions on growth, activities, or\noperations. Truist submitted its inaugural\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC in\nSeptember 2021. On September 30, 2022, the FRB\nand FDIC announced that they did not identify\nany shortcomings or deficiencies in Truist\u2019s\nresolution plan. In August 2023, the FRB and\nFDIC proposed updated guidance on resolution\nplanning requirements applicable to the\nCompany and in January 2024, the agencies\nextended the deadline for the next submission\nfrom July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, Truist Bank, as an IDI, is\nrequired by FDIC regulation to file a separate\nbank level resolution plan every three years.\nThe FDIC issued a policy statement in June\n2021 announcing that it will resume requiring\nbank level resolution plans for large banks,\nincluding Truist Bank, and that such bank-\nlevel resolution plans will have more\nstreamlined content requirements than previous\nrequirements. Truist Bank submitted its\ninaugural IDI resolution plan to the FDIC in\nNovember 2022.\n\nIn August 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal to\namend its rules requiring covered IDIs,\nincluding Truist Bank, to periodically submit\nresolution plans to the FDIC. Covered IDIs\nwould be split into Group A and Group B, with\nGroup A covered IDIs comprising IDIs with $100\nbillion or more in total assets and Group B\nbeing IDIs with at least $50 billion but less\nthan $100 billion in total assets. Group A\ncovered IDIs, including Truist, would be\nrequired to submit full plans, while Group B\ncovered IDIs are only required to submit\ninformation filings. If adopted as proposed,\nTruist Bank would be required to submit a full\nresolution plan to the FDIC every two years\nand submit an interim supplement in each year\nthat it is not required to submit a full\nresolution plan. In addition, this proposal\nwould increase the content requirements for\nplan submissions and introduce a new\ncredibility standard for the FDIC\u2019s evaluation\nof resolution plans, which would be\nenforceable against the covered IDIs. The\nproposed rule indicates the FDIC would create\ntwo submission cohorts for Group A covered\nIDIs, with one cohort submitting a full filing\nat least 270 days from the effective date of\nthe final rule and the other cohort submitting\nan interim supplement filing; the two cohorts\nwould then alternate between a full filing and\nthe interim supplement filing each year. The\nFDIC has not communicated which cohort Truist\nfalls into and has not indicated when the\nproposal will be finalized.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory\nTailoring Rules\n\nCertain U.S. BHCs, including Truist, are\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards. As\nsuch, Truist is subject to more stringent\nliquidity and capital requirements, leverage\nlimits, stress testing, single-counterparty\ncredit limits, resolution planning and risk\nmanagement standards than those applicable to\nsmaller institutions. Certain larger banking\norganizations are subject to additional\nenhanced prudential standards.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 7\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Truist is subject\nto the standards applicable to Category III\nbanking organizations, which generally include\nBHCs with greater than $250 billion, but less\nthan $700 billion, in total consolidated\nassets and less than $75 billion in certain\nrisk-related exposures.\n                                              \n  Capital Requirements                        \n                                              \nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to certain\nrisk-based and leverage capital ratio\nrequirements established by the FRB, for\nTruist, and by the FDIC, for Truist Bank.\nThese requirements are based on the capital\nframework developed by the BCBS for\nstrengthening the regulation, supervision, and\nrisk management of banks under Basel III\nrules, as well as certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. These quantitative\ncalculations are minimums, and the FRB and\nFDIC may determine that a banking\norganization, based on its size, complexity,\nor risk profile, must maintain a higher level\nof capital in order to operate in a safe and\nsound manner. Failure to be well-capitalized\nor to meet minimum capital requirements could\nresult in certain mandatory and discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken,\ncould have an adverse material effect on\nTruist\u2019s operations or financial condition.\nThese actions could include requiring Truist\nto commit capital to Truist Bank in abnormal\noperating conditions which would otherwise be\navailable to Truist\u2019s creditors and\nshareholders. Failure to be well-capitalized\nor to meet minimum capital requirements could\nalso result in restrictions on Truist\u2019s or\nTruist Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or\notherwise distribute capital or to receive\nregulatory approval for acquisitions.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, Truist\u2019s\nand Truist Bank\u2019s assets, exposures, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items are subject to\nrisk weights under the standardized approach\nused to determine the institutions\u2019 risk-\nweighted assets. These risk-weighted assets\nare used to calculate the following minimum\ncapital ratios for Truist and Truist Bank:\n\n\u2022 CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\nCET1 capital primarily includes common\nshareholders\u2019 equity subject to certain\nregulatory adjustments and deductions,\nincluding with respect to goodwill, intangible\nassets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n\n\u2022 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised\nof CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock,\nand certain qualifying capital instruments.\n\n\u2022 Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of total capital, including CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital,\nto risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital\nprimarily includes qualifying subordinated\ndebt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also\nincludes, among other things, certain trust\npreferred securities.\n\nUnder the FRB\u2019s capital framework for BHCs,\nTruist is subject to capital requirements,\nincluding the SCB, that are determined from\nthe supervisory stress test results. The SCB\nis equal to the greater of (i) the difference\nbetween Truist\u2019s starting and minimum\nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the\nseverely adverse scenario in the supervisory\nstress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount\nof its planned common stock dividends for each\nof the fourth through seventh quarters of the\nplanning horizon as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. The FRB\nassigned Truist an SCB of 2.9%, which is\neffective from October 1, 2023 to September\n30, 2024, at which point a revised SCB will be\ncalculated and provided to Truist. Truist is\nrequired to describe its planned capital\nactions in its CCAR capital plan, but is no\nlonger required to seek prior approval if it\nmakes capital distributions in excess of those\nincluded in its CCAR capital plan. Instead,\nTruist is subject to automatic distribution\nlimitations if its capital ratios fall below\nits buffer requirements, which include the\nSCB.\n\nFor certain large banking organizations, the\nSCB could be supplemented by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently\nset at zero. An FRB policy statement\nestablishes the framework and factors the FRB\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the countercyclical capital buffer. Covered\nbanking organizations would generally have 12\nmonths after the announcement of any increase\nin the countercyclical capital buffer to meet\nthe increased buffer requirement, unless the\nFRB determines to establish an earlier\neffective date. If the full countercyclical\nbuffer amount is implemented, Truist would be\nrequired to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of\nat least 9.9%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at\nleast 11.4%, and a Total capital ratio of at\nleast 13.4% to avoid limitations on capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary\nincentive compensation payments. In addition,\nTruist Bank would be required to maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of at least 11.0%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 13.0%.\n\nCertain large banking organizations with\ntrading assets and liabilities above certain\nthresholds, including Truist, are subject to\nthe Market Risk Rule and must adjust their\nrisk-based capital ratios to reflect the\nmarket risk of their trading activities. Refer\nto the \u201cMarket Risk\u201d section of the MD&A for\nadditional disclosures related to market risk\nmanagement.\n\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to a Tier 1\nleverage ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to quarterly average assets, net of\ngoodwill, certain other intangible assets, and\ncertain other deductions. Category III banking\norganizations are also subject to a minimum\n3.0% supplementary leverage ratio. The\nsupplementary leverage ratio is calculated by\ndividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage\nexposure, which takes into account on-balance\nsheet assets as well as certain off-balance\nsheet items, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure of derivative\ncontracts.\n\n8 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe FRB has not yet revised the well-\ncapitalized standard for BHCs to reflect\ncapital requirements imposed under the Basel\nIII Rules. For purposes of certain FRB rules,\nincluding determining whether a BHC meets the\nrequirements to be a FHC, BHCs, such as\nTruist, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based\nCapital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total\nRisk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater\nto meet the well-capitalized minimum. The FRB\nmay require BHCs, including Truist, to\nmaintain capital ratios in excess of mandated\nminimum levels, depending upon general\neconomic conditions and a BHC\u2019s particular\ncondition, risk profile, and growth plans.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators\nissued a proposal to revise the risk-based\ncapital standards applicable to the Company\nand Truist Bank. This proposal would introduce\nnew approaches for credit risk, operational\nrisk, market risk, and credit valuation\nadjustment risk that generally align with the\napproaches for these risks under the global\nBasel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee.\nThe proposal would introduce a new measure of\nrisk-weighted assets, which would reflect the\nproposed new standardized approaches for\ncredit risk, operational risk, and credit\nvaluation adjustment risk, as well as a\nproposed new measure for market risk that\nwould be based on both internal models and\nstandardized supervisory models of market\nrisk. In addition, the proposal requires\ncategory III and IV financial institutions to\ninclude certain components of AOCI in the\ncalculation of regulatory capital, as well as\nchange the calculation of certain deductions\nconsistent with standards in place for\ncategory I and II financial institutions. The\nproposal includes a proposed effective date of\nJuly 1, 2025, subject to a three-year\ntransition period ending July 1, 2028, over\nwhich the expanded total risk-weighted assets\nwould be phased in. We continue to evaluate\nthis proposal and the potential impacts, if\nadopted as proposed, on the Company and Truist\nBank.\n\nRefer to the \u201cCapital\u201d section in MD&A for\ndisclosures containing the minimum regulatory\ncapital ratios and well-capitalized minimum\nratios applicable to Category III banking\norganizations.\n                                              \n  Capital Planning and Stress Testing         \n  Requirements                                \n                                              \nIn addition to the regulatory capital\nrequirements, under the FRB\u2019s CCAR process,\nTruist must submit an annual capital plan to\nthe FRB that reflects its projected financial\nperformance under hypothetical macro-economic\nscenarios, including a supervisory severely\nadverse scenario provided by the FRB.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank\nAct stress testing framework also require BHCs\nsubject to Category III standards, such as\nTruist, to conduct company-run stress tests\nand submit to supervisory stress tests\nconducted by the FRB. The company-run stress\ntests employ stress scenarios provided by the\nFRB and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital\nactions, which are intended to normalize\ncapital distribution assumptions across large\nU.S. BHCs. In addition, Truist is required to\nconduct annual stress tests using internally-\ndeveloped scenarios intended to stress the\nunique risk profile of the institution. The\nFRB also conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act\nsupervisory stress tests employing internal\nsupervisory models on the supervisory stress\nscenarios. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to supervisory\nstress testing on an annual basis and company-\nrun stress testing on a biennial basis.\n\nTruist is required to submit its next capital\nplan and the results of its own stress tests\nto the FRB by April 5, 2024. The FRB is\nrequired to announce the results of its\nsupervisory stress tests by June 30, 2024.\n\nIn addition to the CCAR stress testing for\nTruist, Truist Bank conducts company-run\nstress tests on an annual basis, while only\nrequired biennially.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Requirements                      \n                                              \nCertain BHCs and their bank subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, are subject\nto a minimum LCR and NSFR. The LCR is designed\nto ensure that BHCs have sufficient high-\nquality liquid assets to survive a significant\nliquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar\ndays. The NSFR is designed to ensure that\nbanking organizations maintain a stable, long-\nterm funding profile in relation to their\nasset composition and off-balance sheet\nactivities. The NSFR, calculated as the ratio\nof available stable funding to required stable\nfunding, must exceed 1.0x. Available stable\nfunding represents a weighted measure of a\ncompany\u2019s funding sources over a one-year time\nhorizon, calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to the company\u2019s equity and\nliabilities based on their expected stability.\nRequired Stable Funding is calculated by\napplying standardized weightings to assets,\nderivatives exposures and certain other items\nbased on their liquidity characteristics. As a\nCategory III banking organization, Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to LCR and NSFR\nrequirements equal to 85% of the full\nrequirement.\n\nTruist also is subject to FRB rules that\nrequire certain large BHCs to conduct internal\nliquidity stress tests over a range of time\nhorizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid\nassets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity\nstress test, and maintain a contingency\nfunding plan that meets certain requirements.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nLong-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company\nRequirements\n\nIn August 2023, the U.S. banking regulators\nproposed a rule that would require banking\norganizations with $100 billion or more in\ntotal assets to comply with long-term debt\nrequirements and clean holding company\nrequirements that currently apply only to\nGSIBs. This proposal would also impose a long-\nterm debt requirement on certain categories of\ninsured depository institutions, including\ninsured depository institutions with $100\nbillion or more in total assets, such as\nTruist Bank. If adopted, this proposal would\nrequire the Company and Truist Bank to each\nmaintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-\nterm debt amount of no less than the greatest\nof (i) 6% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5%\nof total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of\naverage total consolidated assets. Truist Bank\nwould be required to issue the minimum amount\nof eligible long-term debt to the Company, and\nthe Company would be required to issue the\nminimum amount of eligible long-term debt\nexternally. In addition, if adopted as\nproposed, the clean holding company\nrequirement would limit or prohibit the\nCompany from entering into certain\ntransactions that could impede its orderly\nresolution, including, for example,\nprohibiting the Company from entering into\ntransactions that could spread losses to\nsubsidiaries and third parties, as well as\nlimiting the amount of the Company\u2019s\nliabilities that are not eligible long-term.\n                                              \n  Payment of Dividends                        \n                                              \nThe Parent Company is a legal entity separate\nand distinct from its subsidiaries, and it\ndepends in part upon dividends received from\nits direct and indirect subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist Bank, to fund its activities,\nincluding its ability to make capital\ndistributions, such as paying dividends or\nrepurchasing shares. Under federal law, there\nare various limitations on the extent to which\nTruist Bank can declare and pay dividends to\nthe Parent Company, including those related to\nregulatory capital requirements, general\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices, and federal banking law\nrequirements concerning the payment of\ndividends out of net profits, surplus, and\navailable earnings. Certain contractual\nrestrictions also may limit the ability of\nTruist Bank to pay dividends to the Parent\nCompany. No assurances can be given that\nTruist Bank will, in any circumstances, pay\ndividends to the Parent Company.\n\nThe Parent Company\u2019s ability to declare and\npay dividends is similarly limited by federal\nbanking law and FRB regulations and policy.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from\nmaking capital distributions if they would be\ndeemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice.\nThe FRB has indicated generally that it may be\nan unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay\ndividends unless a BHC\u2019s net income is\nsufficient to fund the dividends and the\nexpected rate of earnings retention is\nconsistent with the organization\u2019s capital\nneeds, asset quality, and overall financial\ncondition. In addition, the Parent Company\u2019s\nability to make capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends and repurchasing\nshares, is subject to the FRB\u2019s automatic\nrestrictions on capital distributions under\nthe FRB\u2019s capital rules. Truist\u2019s risk-based\ncapital and leverage ratio requirements are\ndiscussed above in the \u201cCapital Requirements\u201d\nsection.\n\nNorth Carolina law provides that, as long as a\nbank does not make distributions that reduce\nits capital below its applicable required\ncapital, the board of directors of a bank\nchartered under the laws of North Carolina may\ndeclare such distributions as the directors\ndeem proper.\n                                              \n  Prompt Corrective Action                    \n                                              \nThe federal banking agencies are required to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect\nto FDIC-insured depository institutions that\ndo not meet minimum capital requirements. The\nlaw establishes five categories for this\npurpose: \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d To be\nconsidered \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d an IDI must\nmaintain minimum capital ratios and must not\nbe subject to any order or written directive\nto meet and maintain a specific capital level\nfor any capital measure. An institution that\nfails to remain well-capitalized becomes\nsubject to a series of restrictions that\nincrease in severity as its capital condition\nweakens. Such restrictions may include a\nprohibition on capital distributions,\nrestrictions on asset growth, or restrictions\non the ability to receive regulatory approval\nof applications. The regulations apply only to\nbanks and not to BHCs. However, the FRB is\nauthorized to take appropriate action at the\nholding company level, based on the\nundercapitalized status of the holding\ncompany\u2019s subsidiary banking institutions. In\ncertain instances relating to an\nundercapitalized banking institution, the BHC,\nin its capacity as a source of strength would\nbe required to guarantee the performance of\nthe undercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those\nguarantee commitments.\n\nIn addition, failure to meet capital\nrequirements may cause an institution to be\ndirected to raise additional capital. Federal\nlaw further mandates that the agencies adopt\nsafety and soundness standards generally\nrelating to operations and management, asset\nquality, and executive compensation; and\nauthorizes administrative action against an\ninstitution that fails to meet such standards.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines may subject\na banking organization to a variety of other\nenforcement remedies, including additional\nsubstantial restrictions on its operations and\nactivities, termination of deposit insurance\nby the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver.\n\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Transactions with Affiliates                \n                                              \nThere are various legal restrictions on the\nextent to which Truist and its non-bank\nsubsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in\ncertain types of transactions with Truist\nBank. Under the Federal Reserve Act and FRB\nregulations, Truist Bank and its subsidiaries\nare subject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit, purchases of\nassets, and certain other transactions\ninvolving its non-bank affiliates. In\naddition, transactions between Truist Bank and\nits non-bank affiliates are required to be on\narm\u2019s length terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                              \n  Acquisitions                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to numerous laws that may\nrequire regulatory approval for acquisitions.\nFor example, under the BHCA, a BHC may not\ndirectly or indirectly acquire ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares\nor substantially all of the assets of any BHC\nor bank or merge or consolidate with another\nBHC without the prior approval of the FRB. The\nBHCA and other federal laws enumerate the\nfactors the FRB must consider when reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC. These factors include the\ncompetitive effects of the proposal in the\nrelevant geographic markets; the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; the effect of the transaction on\nthe financial stability of the United States;\nthe organizations\u2019 compliance with anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved; and the records of performance under\nthe CRA of the IDIs involved in the\ntransaction.\n\nFederal law authorizes interstate acquisitions\nof banks and BHCs without geographic\nlimitation, and a bank headquartered in one\nstate is authorized to merge with a bank\nheadquartered in another state, subject to\nmarket share limitations, regulatory\napprovals, and any state requirement that the\ntarget bank shall have been in existence and\noperating for a minimum period of time. The\nmarket share limitations impose conditions\nthat the acquiring BHC, after and as a result\nof the acquisition, control no more than 10%\nof the total amount of deposits of IDIs in the\nU.S. and no more than 30%, subject to\nvariation by state law, of such deposits in\napplicable states. FRB rules also prohibit a\nFHC from combining with another company if the\nresulting company\u2019s liabilities would exceed\n10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities\nof all financial companies.\n\nAfter a bank has established branches in a\nstate through an interstate merger\ntransaction, the bank may establish and\nacquire additional branches at any location in\nthe state where a bank headquartered in that\nstate could have established or acquired\nbranches under applicable federal or state\nlaw. These regulatory considerations are\napplicable to privately negotiated acquisition\ntransactions.\n\nThe standards by which bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions are evaluated are\nunder review. Among other things, in July\n2021, an executive order was issued on\ncompetition that requires the banking agencies\nto review the standards for bank mergers. In\nMarch 2022, the FDIC requested information and\npublic input on all aspects of the existing\nregulatory framework that applies to bank\nmerger transactions. In June 2023, the\nDepartment of Justice noted that it is\npreparing a revised approach to its assessment\nof bank mergers that will consider a wider\nrange of factors and potential competitive\nharms, consistent with the July 2021 executive\norder. Additionally, some members of\nCongressional leadership are closely tracking\nthe standards for bank mergers and can be\nexpected to engage in hearings and public\nstatements in connection with any pending or\nfuture merger activity. These reviews and\nengagements could change the standards for\nbank mergers. The timing of any revised\nstandards for reviewing bank and financial\ninstitution mergers is uncertain.\n                                              \n  Other Safety and Soundness Regulations      \n                                              \nThe FRB has supervisory and enforcement powers\nover BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit activities\nthat represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nconstitute violations of law, rule,\nregulation, administrative order, or written\nagreement with a federal regulator. These\npowers may be exercised through the issuance\nof confidential supervisory actions, cease and\ndesist orders, civil monetary penalties, or\nother actions.\n\nThere also are a number of obligations and\nrestrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI\nsubsidiaries by federal law and regulatory\npolicy that are designed to reduce potential\nloss exposure to depositors and the DIF in the\nevent the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of\nbecoming insolvent. For example, the FRB\nrequires a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and\nto commit financial resources to support such\ninstitutions in circumstances where it might\nnot do so otherwise.\n\nBanking regulators also have broad supervisory\nand enforcement powers over Truist Bank,\nincluding the power to impose confidential\nsupervisory actions, fines and other civil and\ncriminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver\nin order to conserve the assets of Truist Bank\nfor the benefit of depositors and other\ncreditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to\ntake possession of a North Carolina state bank\nin certain circumstances, including when it\nappears that such bank has violated its\ncharter or any applicable laws, is conducting\nits business in an unauthorized or unsafe\nmanner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition\nto transact its business or has an impairment\nof its capital stock.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\n                                              \n  DIF Assessments                             \n                                              \nTruist Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC\nup to the applicable limits, which is\ncurrently $250,000 per account ownership type.\nThe FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium\nassessment system that determines assessment\nrates for an IDI based on an assessment rate\ncalculator, which is based on a number of\nelements to measure the risk each IDI poses to\nthe DIF. The assessment rate is applied to\ntotal average assets less tangible equity, as\ndefined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The\nassessment rate schedule can change from time\nto time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject\nto certain limits. Under the current system,\npremiums are assessed quarterly.\n\nThe FDIC, as required under the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act, established a plan in\nSeptember 2020 to restore the DIF reserve\nratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum\nof 1.35% within eight years. This plan did not\ninclude an increase in the deposit insurance\nassessment rate. Based on the FDIC\u2019s recent\nprojections, however, the FDIC determined that\nthe DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not\nreaching the statutory minimum by the\nstatutory deadline of September 30, 2028\nwithout increasing the deposit insurance\nassessment rates. In October 2022, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule to increase initial base\ndeposit insurance assessment rate schedules\nuniformly by 2 basis points, beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2023. This rule increased Truist\u2019s\nregulatory premiums in 2023 by approximately\n$120 million. The FDIC also concurrently\nmaintained the Designated Reserve Ratio for\nthe DIF at 2%.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule\nto implement a special assessment to recoup\nlosses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in the first half of 2023. Under the\nrule, the assessment base for the special\nassessment is equal to an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to\nexclude the first $5 billion of uninsured\ndeposits. The special assessment for Truist is\n$507 million, which was recognized in Q4 2023\nand will be paid in eight quarterly\ninstallments beginning in 2024. The ultimate\namount of expenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank, which could result in\nadditional expense.\n                                              \n  Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations    \n                                              \nIn connection with its lending and leasing\nactivities, Truist Bank is subject to a number\nof federal and state laws designed to protect\nborrowers and promote lending to various\nsectors of the economy and population. The\nCFPB examines Truist and Truist Bank for\ncompliance with a broad range of federal\nconsumer financial laws and regulations,\nincluding the laws and regulations that relate\nto deposit products, credit card, mortgage,\nautomobile, student, and other consumer loans,\nand other consumer financial products and\nservices offered. The federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws that are subject to\nthe CFPB\u2019s supervision and enforcement powers\ninclude, among others, the Truth in Lending\nAct, Truth in Savings Act, Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act,\nElectronic Funds Transfer Act, Real Estate\nSettlement Procedures Act, Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, and Fair Housing Act. The\nCFPB also has authority to take enforcement\nactions to prevent and remedy acts and\npractices relating to consumer financial\nproducts and services that it deems to be\nunfair, deceptive, or abusive, and to impose\nnew disclosure requirements for any consumer\nfinancial product or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by Truist or\nTruist Bank. The regulations could reduce the\nfees that Truist receives, alter the way\nTruist provides its products and services, or\nexpose Truist to greater risk of private\nlitigation or regulatory enforcement action.\n                                              \n  Patriot Act                                 \n                                              \nThe Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the\nability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and\nintelligence communities to cooperate in the\nprevention, detection, and prosecution of\ninternational money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism. The Patriot Act\ncontains anti-money laundering measures\naffecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain\nother financial institutions. The Patriot Act\nincludes the International Money Laundering\nAbatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of\n2001, which requires such financial\ninstitutions to implement policies and\nprocedures to combat money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism and grants the\nSecretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority\nto establish regulations and to impose\nrequirements and restrictions on financial\ninstitutions\u2019 operations. The Patriot Act\nimposes substantial obligations on financial\ninstitutions to maintain appropriate policies,\nprocedures and processes to detect, prevent,\nand report money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and other financial crimes. Failure\nto comply with these regulations may result in\nfines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory\nsanctions, reputational damage, or\nrestrictions on business. In addition, the\nPatriot Act requires the federal bank\nregulatory agencies to consider the\neffectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s\nanti-money laundering activities when\nreviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.\n\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  BSA/AML and Sanctions                       \n                                              \nTruist continues to be subject to examinations\nand ongoing monitoring to assess compliance\nwith BSA/AML and OFAC laws and regulations.\nThese laws and regulations are designed to\nprotect the financial system, consumers and\nfinancial institutions from bad actors and\nillicit activities by requiring financial\ninstitutions to develop and implement BSA/AML\nprograms designed to deter and when possible\ndetect and prevent the use of the financial\nsystem to facilitate the funding of criminal\nactivities. In addition, Truist is also\nprohibited from engaging in financial\ntransactions with certain individuals,\nentities, and countries under programs\nadministered by the OFAC of the U.S. Treasury.\n\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal financial institution\nregulators, OFAC and the U.S. Department of\nJustice, among other government agencies, with\nrespect to AML and OFAC laws and regulations.\nThis enforcement authority includes, among\nother things, the ability to assess\nsignificant civil or criminal monetary\npenalties, fines, or restitution; to issue\ncease and desist or prohibition orders; and to\ninitiate injunctive actions against financial\ninstitutions and institution-affiliated\nparties. These enforcement actions may be\ninitiated for violations of laws and\nregulations or unsafe and unsound practices.\n                                              \n  Privacy, Data Protection, and               \n  Cybersecurity                               \n                                              \nVarious federal and state laws and regulations\ncontain extensive data privacy, data\nprotection and cybersecurity provisions, and\nthe regulatory framework for data privacy,\ndata protection and cybersecurity is rapidly\nevolving. The FRB, FDIC, and other bank\nregulatory agencies have adopted guidelines\nfor safeguarding confidential, personal\ncustomer information. These guidelines require\neach financial institution, under the\nsupervision and ongoing oversight of its board\nof directors or an appropriate committee\nthereof, to create, implement, and maintain a\ncomprehensive written information security\nprogram designed to ensure the security and\nconfidentiality of customer information,\nprotect against any anticipated threats or\nhazards to the security or integrity of such\ninformation and protect against unauthorized\naccess to or use of such information that\ncould result in substantial harm or\ninconvenience to any customer. In addition,\nvarious U.S. regulators, including the FRB and\nthe SEC, have increased their focus on\ncybersecurity through guidance, examinations,\nand regulations.\n\nAt the federal level, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct requires financial institutions to, among\nother things, implement policies and\nprocedures regarding the disclosure of\nnonpublic personal information about consumers\nto non-affiliated third parties. In general,\nthe statute requires that financial\ninstitutions provide explanations to consumers\non their policies and procedures regarding the\ndisclosure of such nonpublic personal\ninformation and, except as otherwise required\nby law, prohibits disclosing such personal\ninformation except as provided in the\nfinancial institution\u2019s policies and\nprocedures.\n\nIn November 2021, the FRB, OCC, and FDIC\nadopted a new regulation that, among other\nthings, requires a banking organization to\nnotify its primary federal regulators as soon\nas possible and within 36 hours after\nidentifying a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d\nthat the banking organization believes in good\nfaith is reasonably likely to materially\ndisrupt or degrade its business or operations\nin a manner that would, among other things,\njeopardize the viability of its operations,\nresult in customers being unable to access\ntheir deposit and other accounts, result in a\nmaterial loss of revenue, profit or stock\nprice, or pose a threat to the financial\nstability of the U.S.\n\nIn addition, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted\nnew cybersecurity disclosure rules for public\ncompanies that require disclosure regarding\ncybersecurity risk management (including the\nrole of the Board in overseeing cybersecurity\nrisks, management\u2019s role and expertise in\nassessing and managing cybersecurity risks,\nand processes for assessing, identifying and\nmanaging cybersecurity risks) in annual\nreports. These new cybersecurity disclosure\nrules also require the disclosure of material\ncybersecurity incidents in a Form 8-K,\ngenerally within four days of determining an\nincident is material. Refer to Item 1A, \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d and the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of\nthe MD&A for additional disclosures related to\ncybersecurity.\n\nTruist\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries are also\nsubject to rules and regulations issued by the\nFederal Trade Commission, which regulates\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices,\nincluding with respect to data privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity. Moreover, the\nU.S. Congress has recently considered, and is\ncurrently considering various proposals for,\nmore comprehensive data privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity legislation, to\nwhich Truist may be subject to if passed.\n\nStates are also increasingly proposing or\nenacting legislation that relates to data\nprivacy, data protection, and cybersecurity\nsuch as the California Consumer Privacy Act as\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act.\nTruist may be subject to similar laws in other\nstates where Truist does business or in states\nwhere Truist may collect personal information\nof residents. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S.\nstates generally require businesses to provide\nnotice under certain circumstances to\nindividuals whose personal information has\nbeen disclosed as a result of a data breach.\n\nMoreover, the promulgation in 2017 of the New\nYork Department of Financial Services\nCybersecurity Regulation, which was recently\nupdated, and the National Association of\nInsurance Commissioners Insurance Data\nSecurity Model Law are driving significant\ncybersecurity compliance activities for\nTruist. Both of these regulations include\nphased compliance periods as well as\nattestation of compliance by certain Truist\nentities.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 13\nLike other lenders, Truist Bank uses credit\nbureau data in its underwriting activities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates\nreporting information to credit bureaus,\nprescreening individuals for credit offers,\nsharing of information between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate data for marketing purposes.\nSimilar state laws may impose additional\nrequirements on Truist Bank.\n\nTruist has undertaken significant efforts to\ncomply with these laws and regulations and\ncontinues to assess their requirements and\napplicability to Truist. These laws and\nregulations, as well as proposed legislation,\nare still subject to revision or formal\nguidance and may be interpreted or applied in\na manner inconsistent with the Company\u2019s\nunderstanding, which may result in further\nuncertainty and require Truist to incur\nadditional costs to comply.

The\nproposed rule also would require data\nproviders holding a consumer account, such as\nTruist Bank, to establish a developer\ninterface satisfying certain data security\nspecifications and other standards, through\nwhich the data provider can receive requests\nfor, and provide, specific types of data\ncovered by the rule in electronic, usable form\nto authorized third parties, including data\naggregators. Under the proposed rule, data\nproviders would be prohibited from charging\nconsumers or third parties fees for processing\nthese consumer data requests. The proposed\nrule would also place certain data security,\nauthorization, and other obligations on third\nparties accessing covered data from data\nproviders, which could include Truist and\nTruist Bank when acting in certain capacities.\nThe proposed rule would also require third\nparties to limit their collection, use, and\nretention of the data received to only what is\nreasonably necessary to provide the consumers\u2019\nrequested product or service. We continue to\nevaluate this proposal and the potential\nimpacts, if adopted as proposed, on the\nCompany and Truist Bank.\n                                              \n  CRA                                         \n                                              \nThe CRA requires Truist Bank\u2019s primary federal\nbank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess\nthe bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs\nof the communities served by the bank,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods and persons.

The CRA\nrecord of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also\nis assessed by the FRB in connection with the\nreview of any proposed acquisition or merger\napplication. For its most recent CRA\nexamination period, Truist received the\nhighest possible overall rating of\n\u201cOutstanding\u201d from the FDIC.\n\nIn October 2023, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued\na final rule to amend their regulations\nimplementing the CRA. The rule materially\nrevises the current CRA framework, including\nthe assessment areas in which a bank is\nevaluated to include activities associated\nwith online and mobile banking, the tests used\nto evaluate the bank in its assessment areas,\nnew methods of calculating credit for lending,\ninvestment and service activities, and\nadditional data collection and reporting\nrequirements. The rule is expected to result\nin a significant increase in the thresholds\nfor large banks to receive \u201cOutstanding\u201d\nratings in the future. The rule is expected to\ntake effect on April 1, 2024, with most of the\nprovisions becoming applicable on January 1,\n2026. Reporting of the collected data will not\nbe required until 2027.\n                                              \n  Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation      \n                                              \nThere are federal consumer protection laws\nrelated to automated overdraft payment\nprograms offered by financial institutions.\nThe CFPB prohibits financial institutions from\ncharging consumers fees for paying overdrafts\non automated teller machine and one-time debit\ncard transactions, unless a consumer consents,\nor opts in, to the overdraft service.\nFinancial institutions must also provide\nconsumers with a notice that explains the\nfinancial institution\u2019s overdraft services,\nincluding the associated fees and the\nconsumer\u2019s choices. In addition, FDIC-\nsupervised institutions must monitor overdraft\npayment programs for \u201cexcessive or chronic\u201d\nclient use and undertake \u201cmeaningful and\neffective\u201d follow-up action with clients that\noverdraw their accounts more than six times\nduring a rolling 12-month period. Financial\ninstitutions must also impose daily limits on\noverdraft charges, review and modify check-\nclearing procedures, prominently distinguish\naccount balances from available overdraft\ncoverage amounts, and ensure board and\nmanagement oversight regarding overdraft\npayment programs. In 2022, Truist launched a\nnew approach to the checking account\nexperience, designed to address clients\u2019\ndirect feedback, which includes no overdraft\nfees.\n\n14 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nTruist is prohibited under the Volcker Rule\nfrom (i) engaging in proprietary trading\nactivities, and (ii) having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with covered\nprivate funds. The fundamental prohibitions of\nthe Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of\nany size, including Truist and its affiliates.\nThe Volcker Rule regulations contain\nexemptions or exclusions, including for\nmarket-making, hedging, underwriting, trading\nin U.S. government and agency obligations and\nalso permit certain ownership interests in\ncertain types of funds. They also permit the\noffering and sponsoring of funds under certain\nconditions. The Volcker Rule regulations\nimpose significant compliance obligations on\nbanking entities. Truist has put in place the\ncompliance programs required by the Volcker\nRule.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Regime for Swaps                 \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive\nregulatory regime for the OTC swaps market,\naimed at increasing transparency, and reducing\nsystemic risk in the derivatives markets,\nincluding requirements for central clearing,\nexchange trading, capital adequacy, margin,\nreporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank\nAct requires that certain swap dealers and\nsecurity-based swap dealers register with one\nor both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the\nnature of the swaps business. Truist Bank is\nregistered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and\nconditionally registered with the SEC as a\nsecurity-based swap dealer, subjecting Truist\nBank to requirements under the CFTC\u2019s and\nSEC\u2019s regulatory regime, including trade\nreporting and recordkeeping requirements,\nbusiness conduct requirements (including daily\nvaluations, disclosure of material risks\nassociated with swaps and disclosure of\nmaterial incentives and conflicts of\ninterest), and mandatory clearing and exchange\ntrading requirements for certain standardized\nswaps designated by the CFTC. The NFA is the\nprimary self-regulatory organization for\nTruist\u2019s swap dealer.\n\nTruist Bank\u2019s uncleared swaps and security-\nbased swaps are subject to variation margin\nand initial margin requirements, which have\nbeen fully phased-in across the industry as of\nSeptember 2022.\n                                              \n  Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser        \n  Regulation                                  \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulation by the\nSEC. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory\norganization for Truist\u2019s registered broker-\ndealer subsidiaries. Truist\u2019s broker-dealer\nand investment adviser subsidiaries also are\nsubject to additional regulation by states or\nlocal jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have\nactive enforcement functions that oversee\nbroker-dealers and investment advisers and can\nbring actions that result in fines,\nrestitution, a limitation on permitted\nactivities, disqualification to continue to\nconduct certain activities and an inability to\nrely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain\ntypes of infractions and violations also can\naffect Truist\u2019s ability to issue new\nsecurities expeditiously. In addition, certain\nchanges in the activities of a broker-dealer\nrequire approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes\ninto account a variety of considerations in\nacting upon applications for such approval,\nincluding internal controls, capital levels,\nmanagement experience and quality, prior\nenforcement and disciplinary history, and\nsupervisory concerns.\n                                              \n  FDIC Recordkeeping Requirements             \n                                              \nTruist is subject to certain enhanced deposit\ninsurance recordkeeping requirements adopted\nby the FDIC. To facilitate prompt payment of\nFDIC-insured deposits when large IDIs fail,\nFDIC rules require IDIs with two million or\nmore deposit accounts to maintain complete and\naccurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership\ninterest by right and capacity and to develop\nthe capability to calculate the insured and\nuninsured amounts for each deposit owner by\nownership right and capacity.\n                                              \n  Other Regulatory Matters                    \n                                              \nTruist is subject to examinations by federal\nand state banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFTC, FINRA, NFA, various taxing\nauthorities, and various state insurance and\nsecurities regulators.

When a risk factor spans\nseveral risk categories, the risks have been\nlisted by their primary risk category. The\nrisks described are not all inclusive.\nAdditional risks that are not presently known\nor risks deemed immaterial may have an adverse\neffect on Truist\u2019s financial condition,\nresults of operations, business, and\nprospects.\n                                              \n  Market Risks                                \n                                              \nThe levels of or changes in interest rates\ncould affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nWe are highly dependent on net interest\nincome, which is the difference between\ninterest income on earning assets, such as\nloans and investments, and interest expense on\ndeposits and borrowings. Net interest income\nis significantly affected by market rates of\ninterest, which in turn are influenced by\nmonetary and fiscal policies, general economic\nand market conditions, including high or\nincreasing levels of inflation, the political\nand regulatory environments, business and\nconsumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and\nexpectations about the future, including\nfuture changes in interest rates. We may be\nadversely affected by policies, laws, and\nevents that have the effect of flattening or\ninverting the yield curve (that is, the\ndifference between long-term and short-term\ninterest rates), depressing the interest rates\nassociated with our earning assets to levels\nnear the rates associated with our interest\nexpense, increasing the volatility of market\nrates of interest, including the rate of\nchange, or changing the spreads among\ndifferent interest rate indices.\n\nThe levels of or changes in interest rates\ncould adversely affect us beyond our net\ninterest income, including by increasing the\ncost or decreasing the availability of\ndeposits or other variable-rate funding\ninstruments, reducing the return on or demand\nfor loans or increasing the prepayment speed\nof loans, increasing client or counterparty\ndelinquencies or defaults and reducing the\nvalue of our loans, retained interests in\nsecuritizations, and fixed-income securities\nin our investment portfolio and the efficacy\nof our hedging strategies. Certain investment\nsecurities, notably MBS, are very sensitive to\nchanges in rates. Generally, when rates rise,\nmarket values will decline, prepayments will\ndecrease and the duration of MBS will\nincrease. Conversely, when rates fall, market\nvalues will rise, prepayments of principal and\ninterest will increase and the duration of MBS\nwill decrease.\n\nThe level of and changes in market rates of\ninterest and, as a result, these risks and\nuncertainties, are beyond our control. The\ndynamics among these risks and uncertainties\nare also challenging to assess and manage. For\nexample, while an accommodative monetary\npolicy may benefit us to some degree by\nspurring economic activity among our clients,\nsuch a policy may ultimately cause us more\nharm by inhibiting our ability to grow or\nsustain net interest income. A rising interest\nrate environment can pose different\nchallenges, such as potentially slowing the\ndemand for credit, increasing delinquencies\nand defaults, and reducing the values of our\nloans and fixed income securities. Market\nvolatility in interest rates, including the\nrate of change, can create particularly\ndifficult conditions. Refer to the \u201cMarket\nRisk\u201d section of the MD&A and \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments.\u201d\n               Truist Financial Corporation 21\nThe Company\u2019s hedging strategies may not be\nsuccessful in mitigating our interest rate,\nforeign exchange, and market risks, which\ncould adversely affect our financial results.\n\nThe Company employs various hedging strategies\nto mitigate the interest rate, foreign\nexchange, and market risks inherent in many of\nour assets and liabilities. The Company\u2019s\nhedging strategies rely considerably on\nassumptions and projections regarding our\nassets and liabilities as well as general\nmarket factors. If any of these assumptions or\nprojections prove to be incorrect or our\nhedges do not adequately mitigate the impact\nof changes in interest rates, foreign exchange\nrates, and other market factors, the Company\nmay experience volatility in our earnings that\ncould adversely affect our profitability and\nfinancial condition. In addition, the Company\nmay not be able to find market participants\nthat are willing to act as its hedging\ncounterparties on acceptable terms or at all,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on the\nsuccess of ours hedging strategies. The\nCompany\u2019s hedging strategies are not designed\nto eliminate all interest rate, foreign\nexchange, and market risks.\n\nThe political environment and monetary and\nfiscal policies could adversely affect us.\n\nA fractious or volatile political environment\nin the U.S., including any related social\nunrest, could negatively impact business and\nmarket conditions, economic growth, financial\nstability, and business, consumer, investor,\nand regulatory sentiments, any one or more of\nwhich in turn could cause our business and\nfinancial results to suffer. In addition,\ndisruptions in the foreign relations of the\nUnited States could adversely affect\nindustries and markets on which our business\ndepends. We also could be negatively impacted\nby political scrutiny of the financial-\nservices industry in general or our business\nor operations in particular, whether or not\nwarranted, and by an environment where\ncriticizing financial-services providers or\ntheir activities is politically advantageous.\n\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies,\nincluding FRB policies, can adversely affect\nevery facet of our business and operations\u2014for\nexample, the conditions for commercial and\nconsumer lending, the creditworthiness of our\nclients, the cost of our deposits and other\ninterest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on\nour earning assets\u2014 and cannot be controlled\nor predicted by the Company. FRB policies can:\n\n\u2022 meaningfully influence the availability and\ndemand for loans and deposits, the rates and\nother terms for loans and deposits, and the\nconditions in equity, fixed-income, currency,\nand other markets;\n\n\u2022 significantly impact the cost of funds, as\nwell as the return on assets, both of which\ncan have an impact on interest income;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the value of financial\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect borrowers through higher\ndebt servicing costs and potentially increase\nthe risk that they may fail to repay their\nloan obligations; and\n\n\u2022 artificially inflate asset values during\nprolonged periods of accommodative policy,\nwhich could in turn cause volatile markets and\nrapidly declining collateral values during\ntimes of restrictive monetary and fiscal\npolicies.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the FRB raised interest\nrates significantly and shrank its balance\nsheet in response to inflation measures that\nwere well above the FRB\u2019s two percent target.\nSustained higher interest rates and continued\nFRB asset reductions may adversely affect\nmarket stability, market liquidity and the\nCompany\u2019s financial performance and condition.\nTruist cannot predict the nature or timing of\nfuture changes in monetary policies or the\nprecise effects such changes may have on the\nCompany\u2019s activities and financial results.\n\nIn addition, tax and other fiscal policies\nimpact not only general economic and market\nconditions but also give rise to incentives\nand disincentives that affect how we and our\nclients prioritize objectives, deploy\nresources, and run households and operate\nbusinesses. For example, developments related\nto the U.S. federal debt ceiling, including\nthe possibility of a government shutdown,\ndefault by the U.S. government on its debt\nobligations, or related credit-rating\ndowngrades, could have adverse effects on the\nbroader economy, disrupt access to capital\nmarkets, and contribute to, or worsen, an\neconomic recession.\n\nInflation could negatively impact our business\nand financial results.\n\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact our\nprofitability by negatively impacting our\nfixed costs and expenses, including increasing\nfunding costs and expense related to talent\nacquisition and retention. Additionally,\ninflation may lead to a decrease in consumer\nand clients\u2019 purchasing power and negatively\naffect the need or demand for our products and\nservices. If significant inflation continues,\nour business could be negatively affected by,\namong other things, increased default rates\nleading to credit losses which could decrease\nour appetite for new credit extensions. These\ninflationary pressures could result in missed\nearnings and budgetary projections causing our\nstock price to suffer.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nFinancial results, lending, and other business\nactivities could be adversely affected by weak\nor deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nOur businesses are driven by robust economic\nand market activity, monetary and fiscal\nstability, and positive investor, business,\nand consumer sentiment. A prolonged period of\nslow growth in the U.S. economy as a whole or\nin any regional markets that Truist serves, or\nany deterioration in economic conditions or\nthe financial markets may disrupt or dampen\nthe economy, which could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results.\n\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, the\nCompany may see lower demand for loans by\ncreditworthy clients, reducing the Company\u2019s\ninterest income. In addition, if unemployment\nlevels increase or if real estate prices\ndecrease, the Company could incur higher\ncharge-offs and may incur higher expenses in\nconnection with adverse conditions in the\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used to\nestimate the allowance for credit losses in\naccordance with CECL requirements. These\nconditions may adversely affect not only\nconsumer borrowers but also commercial and\nindustrial and commercial real estate\nborrowers, especially for those businesses\nthat rely on the health of industries or\nproperties that may suffer from deteriorating\neconomic conditions. The ability of these\nborrowers to repay their loans may be reduced,\ncausing the Company to incur higher credit\nlosses.\n\nThe deterioration of economic conditions also\ncould adversely affect financial results for\nthe Company\u2019s fee-based businesses. Truist\nearns fee income from, among other activities,\nmanaging assets for clients, and providing\nbrokerage and other investment advisory and\nwealth management services. Investment\nmanagement fees are often based on the value\nof assets under management and a decrease in\nthe market prices of those assets could reduce\nthe Company\u2019s fee income. Changes in stock or\nfixed income market prices or client\npreferences could affect the trading activity\nof investors, reducing commissions and other\nfees earned from the Company\u2019s brokerage\nbusiness. Poor economic conditions and\nvolatile or unstable financial markets would\nlikely adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital\nmarkets-related businesses.\n\nIn addition, recent events impacting the\nbanking industry, including the bank failures\nin the first half of 2023, have resulted in\nsignificant disruption and volatility in the\ncapital markets, reduced current valuations of\nsecurities portfolios and bank stocks, and\ndecreased confidence in banks among depositors\nand other counterparties as well as investors.\nThese events occurred in the context of\nrapidly rising interest rates which, among\nother things, have resulted in unrealized\nlosses in longer duration debt securities and\nloans held by banks, increased competition for\ndeposits and potentially increased the risk of\na recession. A decrease in the supply of\ndeposits or significant increase in\ncompetition for deposits could result in\nsubstantial increases in costs to retain and\nservice deposits. Increased adoption of\nconsumer banking technology can result in\nreduced deposit demand due to the relative\nease with which depositors may transfer\ndeposits to a different depository institution\nin the event that the Bank\u2019s products and\nservices are less competitive or confidence is\nlost in the Bank. The cost of resolving the\nrecent bank failures has also prompted the\nFDIC to issue a special assessment to recover\ncosts to the DIF. Refer to the \u201cRegulatory\nConsiderations\u201d section in Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d\nfor additional details related to the FDIC\u2019s\nspecial assessment.\n\nGeopolitical conditions, military conflicts,\nacts or threats of terrorism, and related\nvolatility and instability in global economic\nand market conditions could adversely affect\nus.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have an adverse\neffect on the Company\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition. The macroeconomic\nenvironment in the United States is\nsusceptible to global events and volatility in\nfinancial markets. For example, trade\nnegotiations between the U.S. and other\nnations remain uncertain and could adversely\nimpact economic and market conditions for the\nCompany and its clients and counterparties.\nGlobal conflicts present destabilizing forces,\nincluding higher and more volatile commodity\nand food prices, which may cause international\nand domestic economic deterioration. Financial\nmarkets may be adversely affected by the\ncurrent or anticipated impact of military or\nglobal conflicts, terrorism, or other\ngeopolitical events. This could magnify\ninflationary pressure and extend any prolonged\nperiod of higher inflation.\n                                              \n  Credit Risks                                \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to credit risk by\nlending, committing to lend money, and\nentering into letters of credit and other\ntypes of contracts with counterparties and the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be\nadequate to cover actual losses.\n\nTruist incurs credit risk, which is the risk\nto current or anticipated earnings or capital\narising from the default, unwillingness or\ninability of a borrower, obligor, or\ncounterparty such that an obligation will not\nbe repaid on time or in full, or otherwise\naccording to the terms of the contract. A\nnumber of products expose the Company to\ncredit risk, including loans and leases,\nlending commitments, derivatives, trading\nassets, and investment securities. Changes in\ncredit quality can have a significant impact\non the Company\u2019s earnings and capital\nposition. The Company estimates and\nestablishes contractual lifetime reserves for\ncredit risks and credit losses inherent in its\ndetermination of credit exposure. This\nprocess, which is critical to the Company\u2019s\nfinancial results and condition, requires\ncomplex calculations and extensive use of\njudgment, considering both external and\nborrower-specific factors that might impair\nthe ability of borrowers to repay their loans.\nAs is the case with any such assessments,\nthere is always the chance that the Company\nwill fail to identify all pertinent factors or\nthat the Company will fail to accurately\nestimate the impacts of factors identified and\nthat its allowance for loan losses may not be\nadequate to cover actual losses.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 23\nCredit losses may exceed the amount of the\nCompany\u2019s reserves due to changing economic\nconditions, falling real estate prices,\nfalling commodity prices, higher unemployment,\nor other factors such as changes in borrower\nbehavior. There is no assurance that reserves\nwill be sufficient to cover all credit losses.\nIn the event of significant deterioration in\ncurrent or projected future economic\nconditions, the Company may be required to\nincrease reserves in future periods, which\nwould reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and\npotentially impact its capital.\n\nThe Company may have more credit risk and\nhigher credit losses if our underwriting\nstandards and practices are inadequate, we\nadopt more liberal underwriting standards for\ncompetitive or other reasons, or our\nconcentration and other risk limits are not\nwell calibrated.\n\nThe Company\u2019s credit risk and credit losses\ncan increase if the Company\u2019s loans are\nconcentrated in borrowers engaged in the same\nor similar activities or in borrowers who as a\ngroup may be uniquely or disproportionately\naffected by economic conditions, market\nconditions, or climate change. Increased\ndelinquencies or defaults could also result\nfrom our failing to appropriately underwrite\nloans and other products that we originate or\npurchase or from our adopting\u2014for strategic,\ncompetitive, or other reasons\u2014more liberal\nunderwriting standards. There can be no\nassurance that our forecasts of economic\nconditions, our assessments and monitoring of\ncredit risk, and our efforts to mitigate\ncredit risk through risk-based pricing,\nappropriate underwriting and investment\npolicies, loss-mitigation strategies, and\ndiversification are or will be sufficient to\nprevent an adverse impact to our business and\nfinancial results.\n\nDeterioration in economic conditions, housing\nconditions, or real estate values, including\nas a result of climate change or natural\ndisasters, in the markets in which the Company\noperates could result in higher credit losses.\nThe Company is also subject to physical risks\nof climate change, which could manifest in the\nform of asset quality deterioration and could\nbe exacerbated by specific portfolio\nconcentrations, and transition risks of\nclimate change, which could manifest through\nlonger-term shifts in market dynamics and\nconsumer preferences, and could be exacerbated\nin specific industries that may be more\nsensitive or vulnerable to a transition to a\nlow carbon economy.\n\nThe Company may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in weak, deteriorating, or\nstressed economic or market conditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or\nilliquidity, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be\nfurther increased if it fails to realize the\nexpected value of the collateral it holds;\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are\nnot sufficient to recover the full amount owed\nto Truist; or counterparties are unable to\npost collateral, whether for operational or\nother reasons. Furthermore, disputes with\ncounterparties concerning the valuation of\ncollateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility or\nilliquidity, and Truist could suffer losses\nduring these periods if it is unable to\nrealize the expected value of collateral or to\nmanage declines in the value of collateral.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risks                             \n                                              \nOur inability to retain and grow deposits or a\nchange in deposit costs or mix could\nnegatively impact our funding strategy and\nfinancial results.\n\nDeposits are a relatively low cost and stable\nsource of funding. Truist competes with banks\nand other financial institutions for deposits\nand as a result, the Company could lose\ndeposits in the future, clients may shift\ntheir deposits into higher cost products, or\nthe Company may need to raise interest rates\nto avoid deposit attrition. Funding costs may\nalso increase if deposits lost are replaced\nwith wholesale funding. Higher funding costs\nreduce Truist\u2019s net interest margin, net\ninterest income, and net income. In the\ncurrent environment, maintaining and growing\ndeposits has become more challenging as the\nFRB reduced the size of its balance sheet\nthrough quantitative tightening and increased\ninterest rates giving clients an incentive to\nmove deposits to money market funds and other\nhigher-yielding alternatives. In addition, our\nability to maintain, grow, or favorably price\ndeposits may be constrained by gaps in our\nproduct and service offerings, changes in\nconsumer trends, our scale relative to other\nfinancial institutions, competition from\nfintech companies and emerging financial-\nservices providers, any failures or\ndeterioration in our client service, or any\nloss of confidence in our brand or our\nbusiness.\n\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist\u2019s liquidity could be impaired by an\ninability to access short-term funding, an\nunforeseen outflow of cash, or an inability to\nmonetize liquid assets.\n\nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in\nassets and meet obligations as they come due,\nall without incurring unacceptable losses.\nBanks are especially vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk because of their role in the maturity\ntransformation of demand or short-term\ndeposits into longer-term loans or other\nextensions of credit. We, like other\nfinancial-services companies, rely to a\nsignificant extent on external sources of\nfunding, such as deposits and borrowings, for\nthe liquidity needed to conduct our business\nand operations. A number of factors beyond our\ncontrol, however, could have a detrimental\nimpact on the availability or cost of that\nfunding and thus on our liquidity. When\nvolatility or disruptions occur in the\nwholesale funding markets, the Company\u2019s\nability to access short-term liquidity could\nbe impaired. In addition, idiosyncratic\nfactors, including realization of other risks\ndescribed herein, as well as other factors\noutside of the Company\u2019s control, such as a\ngeneral market disruption or an operational\nproblem that affects third parties, could\nimpair the Company\u2019s ability to access short-\nterm or contingent funding, sources or create\nan unforeseen outflow of cash due to, among\nother factors, draws on unfunded commitments\nor deposit attrition. The Company\u2019s inability\nto monetize liquid assets without unacceptable\nlosses or to access short-term funding or\ncapital markets could constrain the Company\u2019s\nability to make new loans or meet existing\nlending commitments and could ultimately\njeopardize the Company\u2019s overall liquidity and\ncapitalization. While our policies and\ncontrols are designed to enable us to maintain\nadequate liquidity to conduct our business in\nthe ordinary course even in a stressed\nenvironment, there is no guarantee that our\nliquidity position will never become\ncompromised. Such an event could damage the\nperformance and value of our business, prompt\nregulatory intervention and private\nlitigation, harm our reputation, and cause a\nloss of client and investor confidence, and if\nthe condition were to persist for any\nappreciable period of time, our viability as a\ngoing concern could be threatened.\n\nA disruption in our access to the mortgage\nsecondary market and GSEs for liquidity could\nnegatively affect us.\n\nTruist sells a portion of the mortgage loans\nthat it originates to reduce the Company\u2019s\nretained credit risk and to provide funding\ncapacity for originating additional loans.\nGSEs could limit their purchases of conforming\nloans due to capital constraints or other\nchanges in their criteria for conforming loans\n(e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower\neligibility). This potential reduction in\npurchases could limit the Company\u2019s ability to\nfund new loans.\n\nProposals have been presented to reform the\nhousing finance market in the U.S., including\nthe role of the GSEs in the housing finance\nmarket. The extent and timing of any such\nregulatory reform of the housing finance\nmarket and the GSEs, as well as any effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business and financial results,\nare uncertain.\n\nThe Company\u2019s cost of funding or access to the\nbanking and capital markets could be adversely\naffected if our credit ratings are downgraded\nor otherwise fail to meet investor\nexpectations.\n\nCredit ratings are influenced by many factors,\nincluding the Company\u2019s profitability, asset\nquality, capital levels, liquidity, business\nmix, operations, and risk management\npractices. Credit ratings may also be\ninfluenced by other factors, some of which are\noutside the Company\u2019s control, such as recent\nand anticipated economic trends, geopolitical\nrisk, legislative and regulatory developments,\nincluding implied levels of government support\nduring a crisis, environmental, social, and\ngovernance considerations, and litigation, as\nwell as changes to the rating agencies\u2019\nmethodologies, among others. Truist\u2019s failure\nto maintain credit ratings could adversely\naffect funding costs and increase the\nCompany\u2019s cost of capital. A downgrade to\nTruist\u2019s credit ratings might also adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct\nderivatives business with certain clients and\ncounterparties and could trigger obligations\nto make cash or collateral payments to certain\nclients and counterparties. Additionally, a\nratings downgrade could affect the Company\u2019s\nability to attract or retain funding,\nincluding deposits from commercial and\ncorporate clients.\n\nThe Parent Company could have less access to\nfunding sources and its liquidity could be\nconstrained if the Bank becomes unable to pay\ndividends.\n\nThe Parent Company relies upon capital markets\naccess and dividends from affiliates for\nfunding and has less access to contingent\nfunding sources than the Bank. If the Bank\nwere subject to a financial stress, its\ndividends to the Parent Company could be\nreduced or eliminated in order to support Bank\ncapital ratios or other regulatory\nrequirements. This would increase the Parent\nCompany\u2019s reliance on capital markets at a\ntime when spreads and funding costs are likely\nelevated due to the stress impacting the Bank\nand would also impair the Parent Company\u2019s\nability to serve as a source of strength to\nits subsidiaries.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\nThe financial system is highly interrelated,\nand financial or systemic shocks or the\nfailure of even a single financial institution\nor other participant in the financial system\ncould adversely impact us.\n\nAdverse developments affecting the overall\nstrength and soundness of other financial\ninstitutions, the financial services industry\nas a whole and the general economic climate\nand the U.S. Treasury market could have a\nnegative impact on perceptions about the\nstrength and soundness of our business even if\nwe are not subject to the same adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, adverse\ndevelopments with respect to third parties\nwith whom we have important relationships\ncould also negatively impact perceptions about\nus. These perceptions about us could cause our\nbusiness to be negatively affected and\nexacerbate the other risks that we face.\n\nTruist may be impacted by actual or perceived\nsoundness of other financial institutions,\nincluding as a result of the financial or\noperational failure of a major financial\ninstitution, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a financial\ninstitution or its ability to fulfill its\nobligations, which can cause substantial and\ncascading disruption within the financial\nmarkets and increased expenses, including FDIC\ninsurance premiums, and could affect our\nability to attract and retain depositors and\nto borrow or raise capital. For example,\nduring 2023 the FDIC took control and was\nappointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank,\nSignature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The\nfailure of other banks and financial\ninstitutions and the measures taken by\ngovernments, businesses, and other\norganizations in response to these events\ncould adversely impact the Company\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine\nfunding transactions could be adversely\naffected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are\ninterrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. Truist\nhas exposure to many different industries and\ncounterparties and routinely executes\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial industry, including brokers and\ndealers, central counterparties, commercial\nbanks, investment banks, mutual and hedge\nfunds and other institutional investors and\nclients. As a result, defaults by, or even\nrumors or questions about, one or more\nfinancial services institutions or the\nfinancial services industry generally, in the\npast have led to market-wide liquidity\nproblems and could lead to losses or defaults\nby Truist or by other institutions. Many of\nthese transactions expose the Company to\ncredit risk in the event of default of the\nCompany\u2019s counterparty or client. In addition,\nthe Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated\nwhen the collateral held by Truist cannot be\nliquidated or is liquidated at prices not\nsufficient to recover the full amount of the\nCompany\u2019s exposure. Any such losses could\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition.\n                                              \n  Technology Risks                            \n                                              \nThe Company and its suppliers face a wide\narray of cybersecurity risks, including risks\nof insider threats and third-party\ncybersecurity incidents, which could result in\nthe loss of operational capabilities or the\ndisclosure of confidential, proprietary,\npersonal, and other sensitive information,\nwhich could have an adverse impact on the\nCompany\u2019s operations, financial condition, and\nprospects, as well as cause significant\nreputational damage and legal and financial\nexposure.\n\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network\ninfrastructure and those of third parties are\ntargeted in cyberattacks and vulnerable to\ndamage or interruption from, among other\nthings, software bugs, server malfunctions,\nsoftware or hardware failure, human error,\nfraud, denial of service attacks, social\nengineering schemes (such as phishing),\nhacking, malware or ransomware intrusion, data\ncorruption attempts, terrorist activities, or\nidentity theft. The Company\u2019s business relies\non the secure collection, transmission,\nstorage, use, retrieval, and other processing\nof confidential, proprietary, and other\nsensitive information in the Company\u2019s\ninformation systems, networks and those of\nthird parties. In addition, to access the\nCompany\u2019s systems, networks, products, and\nservices, the Company\u2019s clients and other\nthird parties may use personal mobile devices\nor computing devices that are outside of the\nCompany\u2019s control and network environment and\ncan introduce added cybersecurity risks.\n\nTruist and Truist\u2019s clients, regulators,\nvendors, service providers, and other third\nparties, including other financial services\ninstitutions and companies engaged in data\nprocessing, have been subject to and are\nlikely to continue to be the target of\ncyberattacks and other similar incidents. Such\nincidents may expose security vulnerabilities\nin the Company\u2019s systems, networks, or other\nsecurity measures, or those of third parties,\nthat could result in the unauthorized access,\ngathering, monitoring, misuse, release, loss,\nor destruction of confidential, proprietary,\nor other sensitive information, including\npersonal information. Such incidents could\nalso damage the Company\u2019s systems and networks\nby introducing material disruptions to the\nCompany\u2019s or the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or other\nthird parties\u2019 network access or business\noperations. As cybersecurity risks continue to\nevolve, the Company may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to continue\nto modify or enhance the Company\u2019s protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate any\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of the\nCompany\u2019s systems and networks and implement\ncontrols, processes, policies and other\nprotective measures, the Company may not be\nable to anticipate all security breaches, nor\nmay the Company be able to implement\nsufficient preventive measures against such\nsecurity breaches, which may result in adverse\nconsequences to Truist.\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions\nhave significantly increased in recent years\nin part because of the proliferation of new\ntechnologies to facilitate and conduct\nfinancial transactions. For example,\ncybersecurity risks may increase in the future\nas Truist continues to evolve its internal and\nexternal digital offerings and capabilities.\nIn addition, cybersecurity risks have\nsignificantly increased in recent years in\npart due to the increased sophistication and\nactivities of organized crime affiliates,\nterrorist organizations, hostile foreign\ngovernments, state-sponsored actors,\ndisgruntled teammates or vendors, hackers,\nactivists and other external parties,\nincluding those involved in corporate\nespionage, any of which may see their\neffectiveness enhanced by the use of\nartificial intelligence, including the use of\ngenerative artificial intelligence to conduct\nmore sophisticated social engineering attacks\non the Company or clients. Even the most\nadvanced internal control environment may be\nvulnerable to compromise. Persistent attackers\nmay succeed in penetrating defenses given\nenough resources, time, and motive. The\ntechniques used by cybersecurity threat actors\nchange frequently and may not be recognized\nuntil launched or well after a breach has\noccurred. In addition, the existence of\ncyberattacks or security breaches at third-\nparty vendors and service providers with\naccess to the Company\u2019s data may not be\ndisclosed to the Company in a timely manner.\n\nThe Company also faces indirect technology,\ncybersecurity and other operational risks\nrelating to clients and other third parties\nthat the Company relies upon to facilitate or\nenable business activities, including,\nfinancial counterparties, regulators, vendors,\nservice providers, and providers of critical\ninfrastructure such as internet access and\nelectrical power. While the Company performs\ncybersecurity due diligence on its key vendors\nand service providers, because the Company\ndoes not control its vendors or service\nproviders and its ability to monitor their\ncybersecurity is limited, the Company cannot\nensure the cybersecurity measures they take\nwill be sufficient to protect any information\nthe Company shares with them or prevent any\ndisruption arising from a technology failure,\ncyberattack or other information or security\nbreach. As a result of increasing\nconsolidation, interdependence, and complexity\nof financial entities and technology systems\nand networks, a technology failure,\ncyberattack or other information or security\nbreach that significantly degrades, deletes,\nor compromises the systems, networks, or data\nof one or more financial entities could have\nan adverse impact on counterparties or other\nmarket participants. This consolidation,\ninterconnectivity, and complexity increases\nthe risk of operational failure, on both\nindividual and industry-wide bases, as\ndisparate systems need to be integrated, often\non an accelerated basis. Any third-party\ntechnology failure, cyberattack, other\ninformation or security breach, termination,\nor constraint could, among other things,\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to\nconduct transactions, service the Company\u2019s\nclients, manage the Company\u2019s exposure to risk\nor expand the Company\u2019s business.\n\nA successful penetration or circumvention of\nsystem or network security could cause serious\nnegative consequences, including loss of\nclients and business opportunities; costs\nassociated with maintaining business\nrelationships after a cyberattack or security\nbreach; significant disruption to the\nCompany\u2019s operations and business;\nmisappropriation, exposure or destruction of\nthe Company\u2019s confidential, proprietary, and\nother sensitive information, including\npersonal information, and funds and those of\nthe Company\u2019s clients; damage to the Company\u2019s\nor the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or third parties\u2019\ncomputers, systems, or networks; or a\nviolation of applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to data privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity. This could\nresult in litigation exposure, regulatory\nfines, penalties, loss of confidence in the\nCompany\u2019s security measures, reputational\ndamage, reimbursement or other compensatory\ncosts, and additional compliance costs, which\ncould adversely impact the Company\u2019s results\nof operations, liquidity, and financial\ncondition. In addition, the Company may not\nhave adequate insurance coverage, if any, to\ncompensate for losses from any of the\nforegoing, and we cannot be sure that our\nexisting insurance coverage will continue to\nbe available on acceptable terms or at all, or\nthat our insurers will not deny coverage as to\nany future claim.\n\nCybersecurity and data-privacy risks have\nreceived heightened legislative, regulatory,\nand supervisory attention. Legislation and\nregulations on cybersecurity and data privacy,\nas well as related supervisory expectations,\ncan compel us to enhance or modify our systems\nand infrastructure, invest in new systems and\ninfrastructure, change our service providers,\naugment our scenario and vulnerability\ntesting, and alter our business practices or\nour policies on security, data governance, and\nprivacy. Any of these, in turn, can cause a\nsignificant increase in the complexity and\ncosts of our operations and expose us to\nenforcement and other supervisory actions,\nrelated litigation by private plaintiffs,\nreputational damage, and a loss of client or\ninvestor confidence.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\nThe Company\u2019s operating systems and\ninfrastructure, as well as operational\ncapabilities managed or supplied by third\nparties on whom we rely, could fail or be\ninterrupted, compromised, or breached, which\ncould disrupt the Company\u2019s business and\nadversely impact the Company\u2019s operations,\nfinancial condition, and prospects, as well as\ncause significant reputational damage and\nlegal and financial exposure.\n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure\nexists throughout the Company\u2019s business and,\nas a result of the Company\u2019s interactions with\nand reliance on third parties, is not limited\nto the Company\u2019s own internal operational\nfunctions. The Company\u2019s operational and\nsecurity systems, networks, and\ninfrastructure, including computer systems and\nnetworks, data management and internal\nprocesses, as well as those of third parties,\nare integral to the Company\u2019s performance.\nTruist relies on numerous third-party vendors\nand service providers to conduct aspects of\nits business operations and faces operational\nrisks relating to them. Third-party\ncybersecurity incidents, such as system\nbreakdowns or failures, misconduct by the\nemployees of such parties, or cyberattacks,\nincluding ransomware, and supply-chain\ncompromises, could affect their ability to\ndeliver a product or service to the Company or\nresult in lost or compromised information of\nthe Company or its clients. Truist cannot be\ncertain that it will receive timely\nnotification of such cyberattacks or other\nsecurity breaches or be able to exert any\nmeaningful control or influence over how and\nwhen the breach is addressed. Like other large\nenterprises, Truist is subject to malicious\ncybersecurity risks and threats directed at\nits vendors, service providers, and other\nthird parties. There is no guarantee that the\nmeasures the Company takes will provide\nabsolute security or recoverability given that\nthe techniques used in cyberattacks are\ncomplex and frequently change and are\ndifficult to anticipate. Truist\u2019s vendors,\nservice providers, and other third parties may\nexpose the Company to risk as a result of\nhuman error, misconduct, malfeasance, or a\nfailure or breach of systems, networks, and\ninfrastructure. For example, the Company\u2019s\nability to conduct business may be adversely\naffected by any significant disruptions to\nthird parties with whom the Company interacts\nor relies upon.\n\nTruist is heavily reliant on technology, and a\nfailure to effectively anticipate, develop,\nand implement new technology could harm us.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing\nrapid technological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services, including those related\nto artificial intelligence. Truist has\ninvested in technology to automate functions\npreviously performed manually, to facilitate\nthe ability of clients to engage in financial\ntransactions and otherwise to enhance the\nclient experience with respect to the\nCompany\u2019s products and services.\n\nTruist expects to make additional investments\nin innovation and technology to address\ntechnological disruption in the industry and\nimprove client offerings and service. These\nchanges are designed to allow the Company to\nbetter serve the Company\u2019s clients and to\nreduce costs. Many of these initiatives take a\nsignificant amount of time to develop and\nimplement, are tied to critical systems, and\nrequire substantial financial, human, and\nother resources. Although we take steps to\nmitigate the risks and uncertainties\nassociated with these initiatives, they are\nnot always implemented on time, within budget,\nor without negative financial, operational, or\nclient impact and do not always perform as we\nor our clients expect. No assurance can be\nprovided that initiatives in the future will\nbe or will do so.\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in\npart, upon the Company\u2019s ability to address\nclients\u2019 needs by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that satisfy client\ndemands, including demands for faster and more\nsecure payment services, to create\nefficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations and\nto integrate those offerings with legacy\nplatforms or to update those legacy platforms.\nA failure to maintain or enhance the Company\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because of a failure to\nanticipate client expectations, a failure in\nthe performance of technological developments\nor an untimely roll out of developments, may\ncause the Company to lose market share or\nincur additional expense.\n\nOur use of systems and other technologies also\ndepends on rights or interests in the\nunderlying intellectual property, which we or\nour service providers may own or license. If\nwe or a service provider were alleged or found\nto be infringing on the intellectual-property\nrights of another person or entity, we could\nbe liable for significant damages for past\ninfringement, substantial fees for continued\nuse, and deprivation of access for limited or\nextended periods of time without the practical\navailability of an alternative.\n\nThe Company faces risks associated with the\nquality, availability, and retention of key\ndata for operational, strategic, regulatory,\nand compliance purposes.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial and regulatory\nreporting, public disclosures, and key\nbusiness decisions are reliant on the quality,\navailability, and retention of data, including\npersonal information. While Truist has a data\nrisk management control framework to mitigate\nthe risks associated with such data while at\nrest, in motion, and in use, this framework\ncannot guarantee that we will effectively\nmitigate risk and limit negative impacts on\nour business and operations. A control\nfailure, for example, may lead to data\nbreaches, data loss, data misuse, and data\nintegrity and quality risks. These failures\nmay ultimately result in inaccuracies in\nfinancial and regulatory reports, inhibited\nmanagement decision-making, financial loss,\nreputational risk, and regulatory compliance\nrisk, including data privacy, data protection,\nand cybersecurity compliance risks. We also\ncan experience enforcement and other\nsupervisory actions, damage to our reputation,\nand private litigation.\n\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Other External Risks                        \n                                              \nPhysical, transition, and other risks\nassociated with climate change, together with\ngovernmental responses to them, may negatively\nimpact our business, operations, reputation,\nand clients.\n\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks\nof climate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters. Climate change\npresents (i) physical risks from the direct\nimpacts of changing climate patterns and acute\nweather events, such as damage to physical\nassets and service disruptions, and (ii)\ntransition risks from changes in regulations,\ndisruptive technologies, and shifting market\ndynamics towards a lower carbon economy. The\nphysical risks of climate change include\ndiscrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes,\ntornadoes, and wildfires, and longer-term\nshifts in climate patterns, such as extreme\nheat, sea level rise, and more frequent and\nprolonged drought. Physical risks may alter\nthe Company\u2019s strategic direction in order to\nmitigate certain financial risks. Such events\ncould also disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or\nthose of its clients or third parties the\nCompany relies on, not only through direct\ndamage to assets, but also from indirect\nimpacts due to supply chain disruption and\nmarket volatility.\n\nTransition risks, including changes in\nconsumer preferences, additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes and additional\ncounterparty or client requirements, could\nhave an adverse impact on asset values and the\nfinancial performance of Truist\u2019s businesses,\nand those of its clients. Climate change could\nalso present incremental risks to the\nexecution of the Company\u2019s long-term strategy.\nWhile material impact from climate change is\nexpected to occur over a longer time horizon,\nthe acceleration of a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy could present idiosyncratic\nrisks for individual companies. Additionally,\ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy will\nentail extensive policy, legal, technology,\nand market initiatives.\n\nGovernments are intensely focused on the\neffects of climate change and environmental\nissues, and how they act to mitigate related\nrisks could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial results. For example,\nthe FRB has announced its development of a\nprogram of scenario analysis to evaluate the\npotential economic and financial risks posed\nby different climate outcomes, and this could\nhave the effect of directly or indirectly\ncompelling us to alter our businesses or\noperations in ways that would be detrimental\nto our results of operations and prospects.\nSuch a program, moreover, could be followed by\nan incorporation of climate and related\nenvironmental risks into the FRB\u2019s supervisory\nstress tests, which may negatively impact us\nand our future capital plans. Further, we may\nbe compelled to change or cease some of our\nbusiness or operational practices or to incur\nadditional capital, compliance, and other\ncosts because of climate- or environmental-\ndriven changes in applicable law or\nsupervisory expectations or due to related\npolitical, social, market, or similar\npressure.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces potential\nreputational risks as a result of its\npractices related to climate change, including\nas a result of the Company\u2019s direct or\nindirect involvement in certain industries, as\nwell as any decisions management makes in\nresponse to managing climate risk, especially\nas views on climate-related matters become\nsubject to increased polarization. Further,\nthere is increased scrutiny of climate change-\nrelated policies, goals, and disclosures,\nwhich could result in litigation and\nregulatory investigations and actions. We may\nincur additional costs and require additional\nresources as we evolve our strategy,\npractices, and related disclosures with\nrespect to these matters.\n\nAs climate risk is interconnected with all key\nrisk types, Truist continues to embed climate\nrisk considerations into risk management\nstrategies. Due to the level of uncertainty\naround the future path of climate change, the\nCompany\u2019s risk management strategies may not\nbe effective in fully mitigating climate risk\nexposures.\n\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses\nfrom fraud.\n\nFraud attacks across the banking sector have\nsignificantly increased in recent years. Bad\nactors have industrialized the execution of\nfraud attacks with ever increasing\nsophistication and speed. Bad actors\nincreasingly use sophisticated applications\nand techniques to perpetrate the fraud. In\nsome cases, these individuals are associated\nwith large criminal organizations that share\ntactics and strategies. Fraud schemes are wide\nranging, including: counterfeit and forged\nchecks; debit and credit card fraud; social\nengineering; ATM attacks through the use of\nskimmers to obtain client data; and phishing\nto obtain client account credentials. These\nschemes make use of a variety of products and\nservices to steal funds, such as real-time\npayments, ACH, and wire transfers. Bad actors\nperpetuate fraudulent activity by\nimpersonating real clients with stolen\nidentities and account credentials, use other\nindividuals, known as mules, to interact with\nTruist, or create new identities, referred to\nas synthetic identities. In some instances,\nthe fraud is committed by existing clients.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 29\nNatural disasters, pandemics, and other\ncatastrophic events could adversely impact us.\n\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, extreme\nweather events, health crises, the occurrence\nor worsening of disease outbreaks or\npandemics, such as COVID-19, or other\ncatastrophic events, as well as government\nactions or other restrictions in connection\nwith such events, could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition or results of\noperations. Truist has significant operations\nand clients along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts\nas well as other regions of the U.S., which\ncould be adversely impacted by hurricanes,\ntornadoes and other severe weather in those\nareas. Truist and its clients could also be\ndisrupted by the physical effects of climate\nchange, which may become more frequent and\nsevere. Natural and other types of disasters,\nincluding as a result of climate change, could\nhave an adverse impact on Truist\u2019s businesses\nin that such events could disrupt the\nCompany\u2019s operations or the ability or\nwillingness of the Company\u2019s clients to access\nthe financial services offered by Truist,\nincluding adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s\nborrowers to timely repay their loans and the\nvalue of any collateral held. These events\ncould reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and cause\nvolatility in the Company\u2019s financial results\nfor any fiscal quarter or year and have an\nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough Truist has business continuity plans\nand other safeguards in place, the Company\u2019s\noperations and communications may be adversely\naffected by natural disasters or other\ncatastrophic events, and there can be no\nassurance that such business continuity plans\nwill be effective.\n\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities\nbetween countries or within a country or\nregion could have an adverse effect on the\nU.S. economy and on Truist\u2019s business\noperations and key external parties.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or\ngroups, including armed conflict or\nintensified cyberattacks, could expand in\nunpredictable ways by drawing in other\ncountries or escalating into full-scale war\nwith potentially catastrophic consequences,\nparticularly if one or more of the combatants\npossess nuclear weapons. Depending on the\nscope of the conflict, the hostilities could\nresult in worldwide economic disruption,\nheightened volatility in financial markets,\nsevere declines in asset values, disruption of\nglobal trade and supply chains, and diminished\nconsumer, business and investor confidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have\nsignificant negative effects on the U.S.\neconomy, and, as a result, Truist\u2019s operations\nand earnings. Truist, its service providers,\nand participants in the financial system could\nalso experience increasing levels and more\naggressive cyberattacks launched by or under\nthe sponsorship of one or more of the\nadversaries in such a conflict.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risks                            \n                                              \nTruist is subject to extensive and evolving\ngovernment regulation and supervision, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and\nprospects.\n\nThe banking and financial services industries\nare highly regulated. Truist is subject to\nsupervision, regulation, and examination by\nregulators, including the FRB, FDIC, NCCOB,\nSEC, CFTC, CFPB, FINRA, MSRB, NFA, and various\nother federal and state regulatory agencies.\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework\napplicable to banking organizations is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and other clients, the DIF, the\nbroader economy, and the stability of the U.S.\nfinancial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and non-deposit\ncreditors. In addition to banking laws and\nregulations, Truist is subject to various\nother laws and regulations, all of which\ndirectly or indirectly affect the operations\nand management of Truist and its ability to\nmake distributions to shareholders. Truist is\nalso subject to heightened requirements under\nthe enhanced prudential standards and expects\nincreased supervisory scrutiny, including, for\nexample, single counterparty credit limits,\nheightened expectations with respect to\ngovernance, risk management and internal\ncontrols and additional capital and liquidity\nrequirements. Reform of the financial services\nindustry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act,\nincluding the EGRRCPA and other legislative\nand regulatory changes, affect the Company\u2019s\noperations.\n\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide\nvariety of laws, rules, and regulations\nvarying across Truist\u2019s lines of business,\ncorporate functions, and jurisdictions, and\ninclude risks related to financial products\nand services, relationships and interactions\nwith clients, and teammate activities.\nCompliance risks include those associated with\nanti-money laundering compliance, trading\nactivities, market conduct, and the laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the offering\nof products and services across jurisdictional\nborders. Compliance risk is also inherent in\nTruist\u2019s fiduciary activities, including the\nfailure to exercise the applicable standard of\ncare to act in the best interest of fiduciary\nclients or to treat fiduciary clients fairly.\n\nThese laws and regulations and Truist\u2019s\ninability to act in certain instances without\nreceiving prior regulatory approval affect\nTruist\u2019s lending practices, capital structure,\ninvestment practices, dividend policy, ability\nto repurchase common stock and ability to\npursue strategic acquisitions, among other\nactivities. Changes to statutes, regulations\nor regulatory policies or their interpretation\nor implementation and the continued\nheightening of regulatory requirements could\naffect Truist in substantial and unpredictable\nways. Federal and state banking regulators\nalso possess broad powers to take supervisory\nactions as they deem appropriate. These\nsupervisory actions may result in higher\ncapital requirements, higher deposit insurance\npremiums, higher compliance expenses, and\nlimitations on the Company\u2019s activities that\ncould have an adverse effect on operations or\nprofitability.\n\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist has elected to be treated as an FHC,\nwhich permits us to engage in a number of\nfinancial and related activities beyond\nbanking, including securities, advisory,\ninsurance, and merchant-banking activities.\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to ongoing\nrequirements for Truist to qualify as an FHC.\nIf a BHC or any of its insured depository\ninstitutions were found not to be well\ncapitalized or well managed, as defined under\napplicable law, the BHC can be restricted from\nengaging in the broader range of financial and\nrelated activities permitted for FHCs,\nincluding the ability to acquire companies\nengaged in those activities, and can be\nrequired to discontinue these activities or\neven divest any of its insured depository\ninstitutions. In addition, if an insured-\ndepository-institution subsidiary of a BHC\nwere to fail to achieve a satisfactory or\nbetter rating under the CRA, the ability of\nthe BHC to expand its financial and related\nactivities or make acquisitions could be\nrestricted.\n\nFinancial regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad power\nand discretion to direct Truist\u2019s actions, and\nthey have assumed an active oversight,\nexamination, and enforcement role across the\nfinancial services industry on both the\nfederal and state levels. Areas of focus in\nthe recent past have been with respect to\nclimate, deposits, interest-rate risk\nmanagement, commercial real estate, risk\ngovernance and controls, capital, liquidity,\nlong-term debt requirements, mortgage-related\npractices, auto lending practices, complaints\nmanagement, sales practices and related\nincentive compensation programs, data privacy,\ndata protection, cybersecurity, fair banking,\noverdraft and other fees, retention and\nrecordkeeping of electronic communications,\nand other compliance matters.\n\nTruist continues to be subject to examinations\nand ongoing monitoring to assess compliance\nwith BSA/AML and OFAC laws and regulations.\nThese laws and regulations are designed to\nprotect the financial system, consumers and\nfinancial institutions from bad actors and\nillicit activities by requiring financial\ninstitutions to develop and implement BSA/AML\nprograms designed to deter and when possible\ndetect and prevent the use of the financial\nsystem to facilitate the funding of criminal\nactivities. In addition, Truist is also\nprohibited from engaging in financial\ntransactions with certain individuals,\nentities, and countries under programs\nadministered by the OFAC of the U.S. Treasury.\nAdditionally, actual or alleged misconduct by\nteammates, including unethical, fraudulent,\nimproper, or illegal conduct, or unfair,\ndeceptive, abusive, or discriminatory\npractices, can result in litigation, or\ngovernment investigations and enforcement\nactions, and cause significant reputational\nharm to Truist, even if allegations are\nultimately unsubstantiated.\n\nThe Company and other large financial\ninstitutions have become subject to increased\nscrutiny, more intense supervision and\nregulation, and more supervisory findings and\nactions, with increased operational costs, as\nwell as impacts on geographic expansion and\nacquisitions, which we expect to continue. The\nfinancial services industry also continues to\nface a stricter and more aggressive\nenforcement of laws at federal, state, and\nlocal levels\u2014particularly in connection with\nbusiness and other practices that may harm or\nappear to harm consumers or affect the\nfinancial system more broadly. Financial\ninstitutions often are less inclined to\nlitigate with governmental authorities because\nof the regulatory and supervisory framework.\nTruist expects that its businesses will remain\nsubject to extensive regulation and\nsupervision. Any potential new regulations or\nmodifications to existing regulations would\nlikely necessitate changes to Truist\u2019s\nexisting regulatory compliance and risk\nmanagement infrastructure.\n\nOur regulatory and supervisory environments,\nwhether at federal, state, or local levels,\nare not static. No assurance can be given that\napplicable statutes, regulations, and other\nlaws will not be amended or construed\ndifferently, that new laws will not be\nadopted, or that any of these laws will not be\nenforced more aggressively. Truist could\nbecome subject to future legislation and\nregulatory requirements beyond those currently\nproposed, adopted, or contemplated in the U.S.\nor abroad, including policies and rulemaking\nrelated to the Dodd-Frank Act, limits on\nacquisitions, more stringent capital and\nliquidity requirements, policies and\nrulemaking related to emerging technologies,\ncybersecurity and data, and climate risk\nmanagement and ESG governance and reporting,\nincluding emissions and sustainability\ndisclosure. In addition, concerns over climate\nchange may prompt changes in regulations that,\nin turn, could have an adverse impact on asset\nvalues and the financial performance of\nTruist\u2019s businesses and its clients. The\ncumulative effect of such legislation and\nregulations on Truist\u2019s business, operations,\nand profitability cannot be accurately\npredicted. Such regulatory changes may reduce\nTruist\u2019s revenues, limit the types of\nfinancial services and products it may offer,\nalter the investments it makes, affect the\nmanner in which it operates its businesses,\nincrease its litigation and regulatory costs\nand increase the ability of non-banks to offer\ncompeting financial services and products.\nFurther, our noncompliance with applicable\nlaws, whether as a result of changes in\ninterpretation or enforcement, system or human\nerrors, or otherwise and, in some cases,\nregardless of whether noncompliance was\ninadvertent, can result in the suspension or\nrevocation of licenses or registrations that\nwe need to operate and in the initiation of\nenforcement and other supervisory actions or\nprivate litigation.\n\nTruist also relies upon third parties who may\nexpose the Company to compliance and legal\nrisk. New or existing legal requirements also\ncould heighten the reputational impact of\nperceived misuses of client data by the\nCompany and third parties. See additional\ndisclosures in the \u201cRegulatory Considerations\u201d\nsection in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nRegulatory capital and liquidity standards and\nfuture revisions to them may negatively impact\nour business and financial results.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements established by the FRB\nand the FDIC. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the BCBS and then\napplied, with adjustments, in each country by\nthe appropriate domestic regulatory bodies.\nDomestic regulatory agencies have the ability\nto apply stricter capital and liquidity\nstandards than those developed by the BCBS. In\nseveral instances, the U.S. banking agencies\nhave done so with respect to U.S. banking\norganizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of the\nCompany\u2019s capital and liquidity may prevent\nthe Company from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force the Company to take\nactions contrary to their interests. For\nexample, Truist may be limited in its ability\nto pay or increase dividends or otherwise\nreturn capital to shareholders. In addition,\nthese requirements may impact the amount and\ntype of loans the Company is able to make.\nTruist may be constrained in its ability to\nexpand, either organically or through mergers\nand acquisitions. These requirements may cause\nthe Company to sell or refrain from acquiring\nassets where the capital requirements appear\ninconsistent with the assets\u2019 underlying\nrisks. In addition, liquidity standards\nrequire the Company to maintain holdings of\nhighly liquid investments, thereby reducing\nthe Company\u2019s ability to invest in less liquid\nassets, even if more desirable from a balance\nsheet return or interest rate risk management\nperspective. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to additional\ncapital and liquidity requirements. For\nexample, Truist is subject to a requirement to\nsubmit capital plans to the Federal Reserve\nfor review that include, among other things,\nprojected dividend payments and repurchases of\ncapital stock. As part of the capital planning\nand stress testing processes, our capital\nactions are assessed against our ability to\nsatisfy applicable capital requirements in the\nevent of a stressed market environment. If we\nfail to satisfy applicable capital\nrequirements, including the SCB, our ability\nto undertake capital actions may be\nrestricted.\n\nThe liquidity standards applicable to large\nU.S. banking organizations have been\nsupplemented in recent years. The NSFR rule,\nwhich is designed to ensure that banking\norganizations maintain a stable funding\nprofile in relation to their asset composition\nand off-balance sheet activities, became\neffective on July 1, 2021. Public disclosure\nof the NSFR began in 2023.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements applicable to Truist\nand Truist Bank, the Company\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to capital\nrequirements established by the SEC.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nreceive periodic review and revision by the\nBCBS and the U.S. banking agencies. Proposed\nchanges to applicable capital and liquidity\nrequirements, such as the Basel III proposal\nand the long-term debt proposal, could result\nin increased expenses or cost of funding,\nwhich could negatively affect our financial\nresults or our ability to pay dividends and\nengage in share repurchases. For more\ninformation concerning our legal and\nregulatory obligations with respect to Basel\nIII and long-term debt requirements, please\nsee \u201cRegulatory Considerations\u201d in Item 1\n\u201cBusiness.\u201d\n\nTruist is subject to risks related to\noriginating and selling loans, including\nrepurchase and indemnification obligations.\n\nWhen loans are sold or securitized, it is\ncustomary to make representations and\nwarranties to the purchaser about the loans,\nincluding the manner in which they were\noriginated. These agreements generally require\nthe repurchase of loans or indemnification in\nthe event of a breach of these representations\nor warranties. An increase in the number of\nrepurchase and indemnity demands from\npurchasers related to representations and\nwarranties on sold loans could result in an\nincrease in the amount of losses for loan\nrepurchases. Truist also bears a risk of loss\nfrom borrower defaults for multi-family\ncommercial mortgage loans sold to FNMA.\n\nIn addition to repurchase claims from GSEs,\nTruist could be subject to indemnification\nclaims from non-GSE purchasers of the\nCompany\u2019s mortgage loans. Claims could be made\nif the loans sold fail to conform to\nstatements about their quality, the manner in\nwhich the loans were originated and\nunderwritten or their compliance with state\nand federal law.\n\nAdditional factors affecting the extent to\nwhich we may securitize loans and receivables\nin the future include the overall credit\nquality of our loans and receivables, the\ncosts of securitizing our loans and\nreceivables, the demand for consumer asset-\nbacked securities and the legal, regulatory,\naccounting or tax rules affecting\nsecuritization transactions and asset-backed\nsecurities, generally.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist faces risks as a servicer of loans.\n\nThe Company acts as servicer for a range of\nassets and products and primarily for loans in\nsecuritizations and unsecuritized loans owned\nby investors. As servicer for loans, the\nCompany has certain contractual obligations to\nthe securitization trusts, investors, or other\nthird parties. As a servicer, Truist\u2019s\nobligations include foreclosing on defaulted\nloans or, to the extent consistent with the\napplicable securitization or other investor\nagreement, considering alternatives to\nforeclosure such as loan modifications or\nshort sales. Generally, the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations are set by contract, for\nwhich the Company receives a contractual fee.\nHowever, GSEs can amend their servicing\nguidelines unilaterally for certain government\nguaranteed mortgages, which can increase the\nscope or costs of the services required\nwithout any corresponding increase in the\nCompany\u2019s servicing fee. Further, the CFPB has\nimplemented national servicing standards,\nwhich have increased the scope and cost of\nservices that the Company is required to\nperform. In addition, there has been a\nsignificant increase in state laws that impose\nadditional servicing requirements that\nincrease the scope and cost of the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations. As a servicer, the\nCompany also advances expenses on behalf of\ninvestors, which it may be unable to collect.\n\nA material breach of the Company\u2019s obligations\nas servicer may result in contract termination\nif the breach is not cured within a specified\nperiod of time following notice, which can\ngenerally be given by the securitization\ntrustee or a specified percentage of security\nholders, causing the Company to lose servicing\nincome. In addition, the Company may be\nrequired to indemnify the securitization\ntrustee against losses from any failure by the\nCompany, as a servicer, to perform the\nCompany\u2019s servicing obligations or any act or\nomission on the Company\u2019s part that involves\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross\nnegligence. For certain investors and certain\ntransactions, Truist may be contractually\nobligated to repurchase a loan or reimburse\nthe investor for credit losses incurred on the\nloan as a remedy for servicing errors with\nrespect to the loan. The Company may be\nsubject to increased repurchase obligations as\na result of claims made that the Company did\nnot satisfy its obligations as a servicer. The\nCompany may also experience increased loss\nseverity on repurchases, which may require a\nmaterial increase to the Company\u2019s repurchase\nreserve.\n\nThe Company has and may continue to receive\nindemnification requests related to the\nCompany\u2019s servicing of loans owned or insured\nby other parties, primarily GSEs. Typically,\nsuch a claim seeks to impose a compensatory\nfee on the Company for departures from GSE\nservice levels. In most cases, this is related\nto delays in the foreclosure process.\nAdditionally, the Company has received\nindemnification requests where an investor or\ninsurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of\nthe servicing agreement. While the number of\nsuch claims has been small, these could\nincrease in the future.\n\nTruist faces substantial risks in safeguarding\npersonal and other sensitive information.\n\nTruist\u2019s businesses are subject to complex and\nevolving laws, rules, and regulations\ngoverning data privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity, particularly with respect to\nthe privacy and protection of personal\ninformation of individuals. Individuals whose\npersonal information may be protected by law\ncan include the Company\u2019s clients (and in some\ncases its clients\u2019 clients), prospective\nclients, job applicants, teammates, and the\nemployees of the Company\u2019s vendors, and other\nthird parties. Complying with the laws, rules,\nand regulations applicable to the Company\u2019s\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage,\nand other processing of personal information\ncan increase operating costs, impact the\ndevelopment of new products or services, and\nreduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling\nor misuse of personal information by the\nCompany or a third-party affiliated with the\nCompany could expose the Company to litigation\nor regulatory fines, penalties, or other\nsanctions.\n\nAdditional risks could arise from the failure\nof the Company or third parties to provide\nadequate disclosure or transparency to the\nCompany\u2019s clients about the personal\ninformation collected from them and the use of\nsuch information; to receive, document, and\nhonor the privacy preferences expressed by the\nCompany\u2019s clients; to protect personal\ninformation from unauthorized disclosure; or\nto maintain proper training on data privacy,\ndata protection, or cybersecurity practices\nfor all teammates or third parties who have\naccess to personal information. Concerns\nregarding the effectiveness of Truist\u2019s\nmeasures to safeguard personal information, or\neven the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause Truist to lose\nexisting or potential clients, and thereby\nreduce Truist\u2019s revenues. Furthermore, any\nfailure or perceived failure by the Company to\ncomply with applicable data privacy, data\nprotection, or cybersecurity laws, rules, or\nregulations may subject it to inquiries,\nexaminations and investigations that could\nresult in requirements to modify or cease\ncertain operations or practices, significant\nliabilities or regulatory fines, penalties, or\nother sanctions. Any of these could damage\nTruist\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely\naffect its businesses.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 33\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents\ninvolving the inappropriate disclosure,\ncollection, use, sharing, storage, and other\nprocessing of personal information have led to\nexpanded governmental scrutiny of practices\nrelating to the safeguarding of personal\ninformation by companies. That scrutiny has in\nsome cases resulted in, and could in the\nfuture lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,\nrules and regulations relating to the\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage,\nand other processing of personal information.\nTruist will likely be subject to new and\nevolving data privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity laws, rules and regulations in\nthe U.S. and abroad, which could result in\nadditional costs of compliance, litigation,\nregulatory fines, and enforcement actions.\nThese types of laws, rules and regulations\ncould prohibit or significantly restrict\nfinancial services firms such as Truist from\nsharing information among affiliates or with\nthird parties such as vendors, and thereby\nincrease compliance costs, or could restrict\nTruist\u2019s use of personal information when\ndeveloping or offering products or services to\nclients. These restrictions could also inhibit\nTruist\u2019s development or marketing of certain\nproducts or services or increase the costs of\noffering them to clients.\n\nFor more information concerning our legal and\nregulatory obligations with respect to data\nprivacy, data protection, and cybersecurity,\nplease see \u201cPrivacy, Data Protection, and\nCybersecurity\u201d in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\n\nDifferences in regulation and supervision can\naffect the Company\u2019s ability to compete\neffectively.\n\nThe content and application of laws and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as\nthe size of the firm, the jurisdiction in\nwhich it is organized or operates, and other\ncriteria. Large institutions, such as the\nCompany, often are subject to more stringent\nregulatory requirements and supervision than\nsmaller institutions. In addition, financial\ntechnology companies and other non-traditional\ncompetitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation or may be supervised by a national\nor state regulatory agency that does not have\nthe same regulatory priorities or supervisory\nrequirements as the Company\u2019s regulators.\nThese differences in regulation can impair the\nCompany\u2019s ability to compete effectively with\ncompetitors that are less regulated and do not\nhave similar compliance costs.\n\nThe Company can face risks of non-compliance\nand incur additional operational and\ncompliance costs under laws relating to anti-\nmoney laundering, economic sanctions, embargo\nprograms, and anti-corruption.\n\nTruist must comply with laws and regulations\nrelating to anti-money laundering, economic\nsanctions, embargo programs and anti-\ncorruption, which can increase its risks of\nnon-compliance and costs associated with the\nimplementation and maintenance of complex\ncompliance programs. A violation of any of\nthese legal and regulatory requirements could\nsubject Truist or individual employees to\nregulatory enforcement actions as well as\nsignificant civil and criminal penalties.\n                                              \n  Regulatory and Legal Risks                  \n                                              \nThe Company may incur damages, fines,\npenalties, and other negative consequences\nfrom past, current, or future regulatory or\nother legal violations, including inadvertent\nor unintentional violations.\n\nTruist maintains systems and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that it complies with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can\nbe no assurance that these will be effective.\nIn addition to fines and penalties, the\nCompany may suffer other negative consequences\nfrom regulatory violations including\nrestrictions on certain activities and damage\nto the Company\u2019s reputation, which in turn\nmight adversely affect the Company\u2019s business\nand results of operations.\n\nFederal and state law grants substantial\nenforcement powers to federal and state\nbanking regulators and law enforcement\nagencies. This enforcement authority includes,\namong other things, the ability to assess\nsignificant civil or criminal monetary\npenalties, fines, or restitution; to issue\ncease and desist or removal orders; and to\ninitiate injunctive actions against banking\norganizations and institution-affiliated\nparties. These enforcement actions may be\ninitiated for violations of laws and\nregulations and unsafe or unsound practices.\nAny future enforcement action could have an\nadverse impact. In addition, governmental\nauthorities have, at times, sought criminal\npenalties against companies in the financial\nservices sector for violations, and, at times,\nhave required an admission of wrongdoing,\ncriminal pleas or other extraordinary terms\nfrom financial institutions in connection with\nresolving such matters. Criminal convictions\nor criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing\nin a settlement with the government can lead\nto greater exposure in civil litigation,\nreputational harm, and other significant\ncollateral consequences such as restrictions\non engaging in new activities or acquisitions,\nloss of clients, restrictions on the ability\nto access the capital markets and the\ninability to operate certain businesses or\noffer certain products for a period of time.\n\nFailures to comply with law, regulatory\nrequirements, or supervisory expectations\nexpose the Company to fines, regulatory\npenalties, significant remediation actions and\nother costs, reputational damage, civil\nlitigation, restrictions on returning capital\nto shareholders through share repurchases or\ndividends, constraints on existing activities,\nand regulatory or enforcement actions which,\nin turn, frequently result in limitations on\nengaging in new activities, expanding\ngeographically, or pursuing acquisitions or\nother growth opportunities and lead to higher\noperational and compliance costs. Violations\nof laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies\nin risk management, consumer compliance, or\nother practices also may be incorporated into\nTruist\u2019s confidential supervisory ratings with\nassociated adverse effects.\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal financial institution\nregulators, OFAC and the U.S. Department of\nJustice, among other government agencies with\nrespect to AML and OFAC laws and regulations.\nThis enforcement authority includes, among\nother things, the ability to assess\nsignificant civil or criminal monetary\npenalties, fines, or restitution; to issue\ncease and desist or prohibition orders; and to\ninitiate injunctive actions against financial\ninstitutions and institution-affiliated\nparties. These enforcement actions may be\ninitiated for violations of laws and\nregulations or unsafe and unsound practices.\n\nPending or threatened legal proceedings and\nother matters may adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the\nCompany is subject to lawsuits, claims, and\nformal and informal enforcement activity,\nincluding regulatory investigations. The\nvolume of legal proceedings against\nparticipants in the financial services\nindustry, including the Company, is\nsubstantial, and enforcement actions by\nregulatory authorities are becoming more\ncommon in the current regulatory environment.\nLegal proceedings against financial services\nfirms may increase depending on factors such\nas market downturn, changes in law and\nincreased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny or the results\nof an investigation or examination may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. There is no assurance\nthat those actions will not result in\nregulatory settlements or other enforcement\nactions against Truist. Furthermore, a single\nevent involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings by\nmultiple federal and state agencies and\nofficials. In addition, if one or more\nfinancial institutions are found to have\nviolated a law or regulation relating to\ncertain business activities, this could lead\nto investigations by regulators or other\ngovernmental agencies of the same or similar\nactivities by other financial institutions,\nincluding Truist, and large fines and remedial\nmeasures that may have been imposed in\nresolving earlier investigations for the same\nor similar activities at other financial\ninstitutions may be used as the basis for\nfuture settlements.\n\nClaims and legal actions, including class\naction lawsuits and enforcement proceedings,\ncould involve large monetary amounts,\nsignificant defense costs, and result in\nsettlements, judgments, penalties, fines,\ninjunctions, or other forms of relief that are\nadverse to the Company. Responding to\ninquiries, investigations, lawsuits, and other\nproceedings is time-consuming and expensive\nand can divert senior management attention\nfrom Truist\u2019s business.\n\nThe outcome of any such legal proceedings, as\nwell as the timing of any ultimate\nresolutions, may be difficult to predict or\nestimate. Actual legal and other costs arising\nfrom claims and legal actions may be greater\nthan the Company\u2019s legal accruals. Further,\nthe Company may not have accruals for all\nlegal proceedings where we face a risk of\nloss. The ultimate resolution of a pending\nlegal proceeding or significant regulatory or\ngovernment action against the Company could\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition or cause\nsignificant reputational harm, which may\nadversely impact the Company\u2019s business\nprospects. Further, the Company may be exposed\nto substantial uninsured liabilities, which\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s results\nof operations and financial condition. Refer\nto the Legal Proceedings and Other Matters\nsection in \u201cNote 16. Commitments and\nContingencies\u201d for additional information.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risks                             \n                                              \nIneffective execution of strategic initiatives\ncould adversely affect investor sentiment and\nour business and financial results.\n\nThere is no guarantee that our strategic\ninitiatives, including our current initiatives\nto streamline and simplify our business,\nreduce expenses, as well as, to increase\ndigitization, will ultimately be successful.\nOur execution of strategic initiatives may be\nimpacted by internal factors, such as\nmaintaining a level of earnings appropriate to\nsupport growth objectives, the ability to\nmaintain dividends in various economic cycles,\nor the successful delivery of innovative and\ntechnology strategies. In addition, our\nexecution of our strategies may be impacted by\nour response to external factors, including\ngeopolitical, macroeconomic, social, cultural,\ncompetitive, and regulatory factors. To the\nextent we are impeded or unable to execute\neffective strategic initiatives, our prospects\nfor growth, earnings, capital levels, and\nstock price as well as stakeholder confidence\nin Truist could be adversely affected.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\nCompetition may reduce Truist\u2019s client base or\ncause Truist to modify the pricing or other\nterms for products and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business and\nfinancial results.\n\nTruist operates in a highly competitive\nindustry that could become even more\ncompetitive with growth in areas such as neo-\nbanks, fintechs, and other non-bank platforms.\nIncreased competition could arise from\ntechnological advancements, legislative and\nregulatory changes, as well as competition\nfrom other financial services companies, some\nof which may be subject to less extensive\nregulation than Truist. The Company\u2019s success\ndepends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to\nadapt its offering of products and services to\nevolving industry standards and client\nexpectations. The widespread adoption of new\ntechnologies has required and will continue to\nrequire substantial investments to modify\nexisting products and services or to develop\nnew products and services. In addition, there\nis increasing pressure to provide products and\nservices at lower prices further reducing\ncontribution margins. The Company may not be\nsuccessful in introducing new products and\nservices in response to industry trends or\ndevelopments in technology or those new\nproducts may not achieve market acceptance.\n\nTruist also competes with nonbank companies\ninside and outside of the Company\u2019s market\narea and, in some cases, with companies other\nthan those traditionally considered financial\nsector participants. In particular, technology\ncompanies are increasingly focusing on the\nfinancial sector, either in partnership with\ncompetitor banking organizations or on their\nown. These companies generally are not subject\nto the same regulatory oversight as main\nstreet financial institutions and may\naccordingly realize certain cost strategies\nand offer products and services at more\nfavorable rates and with greater convenience\nto the client. This competition could result\nin the loss of clients and revenue in areas\nwhere fintechs are operating. As the pace of\ntechnology and change advance, continuous\ninnovation is expected to exert long-term\npressure on the financial services industry.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies by\ncompetitors, including internet banking\nservices, mobile applications, advanced ATM\nfunctionality, artificial intelligence, and\ncryptocurrencies, could require the Company to\nmake substantial investments to modify or\nadapt the Company\u2019s existing products and\nservices or even radically alter the way\nTruist conducts business. These and other\ncapital investments in the Company\u2019s business\nmay not produce expected growth in earnings\nanticipated at the time of the expenditure.\n\nAcquisitions, mergers, and divestitures\nintroduce a broad range of anticipated and\nunanticipated risks, including unforeseen or\nnegative consequences from supervisory or\nregulatory action that may limit Truist\u2019s\nability to pursue and complete them.\n\nWe may from time to time seek to acquire other\nfinancial-services companies or businesses.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and\nuncertainties, including inaccurate financial\nand operational assumptions, incomplete or\nfailed due diligence, lower than expected\nperformance, higher than expected costs,\ndifficulties related to integration, diversion\nof management\u2019s attention from other business\nactivities, adverse market or other reactions,\nchanges in relationships with clients or\ncounterparties, the potential loss of key\npersonnel, and the possibility of litigation\nand other disputes. An acquisition also could\nbe dilutive to our existing shareholders if we\nwere to issue common stock to fully or\npartially pay or fund the purchase price. We,\nmoreover, may not be successful in identifying\nappropriate acquisition candidates,\nintegrating acquired companies or businesses,\nor realizing expected value from acquisitions.\nThere is significant competition for valuable\nacquisition targets, and we may not be able to\nacquire other companies or businesses on\nattractive terms. No assurance can be given\nthat we will pursue future acquisitions, and\nour ability to grow and successfully compete\nmay be impaired if we choose not to pursue or\nare unable to successfully make acquisitions.\n\nThe Company must satisfy a number of\nmeaningful conditions before completing an\nacquisition of another bank or BHC, including\nfederal and state regulatory approvals. In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nor BHC acquisition, bank regulators will\nconsider, among other factors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on competition; financial\ncondition and future prospects, including\ncurrent and projected capital ratios and\nlevels; the competence, experience and\nintegrity of management; the supervisory\nrelationship; record of compliance with laws\nand regulations; the convenience and needs of\nthe communities to be served, including the\nacquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance\nunder the CRA; the effectiveness of the\nacquiring institution in combating money\nlaundering activities; and public comments\nfrom various stakeholders. In addition, U.S.\nregulators must take systemic risk to the U.S.\nfinancial system into account when evaluating\nwhether to approve a potential acquisition\ntransaction involving a large financial\ninstitution like Truist. There is no certainty\nas to when or if or on what terms and\nconditions, any required regulatory approvals\nwill be granted for any potential acquisition.\nIn specific cases, Truist may be required to\nsell banks or branches or take other actions\nas a condition to receiving regulatory\napproval. An inability to satisfy other\nconditions necessary to consummate an\nacquisition transaction, such as third-party\nlitigation, a judicial order blocking the\ntransaction or lack of shareholder approval,\ncould also prevent the Company from completing\nan announced acquisition. There has been\nincreased scrutiny of bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions from regulators and\ngovernment entities in recent years. Refer to\nthe \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section within Item 1\n\u201cBusiness\u201d for additional discussion.\n\n36 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn addition, we may decide to divest certain\nbusinesses or assets. For example, we entered\ninto an equity interest purchase agreement for\nthe sale of our remaining equity interests in\nTIH on February 20, 2024. Purchases or\ndivestitures of businesses involve a number of\nrisks, including significant costs and\nexpenses, and any divestiture we undertake\ncould adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash\nflows. Divestitures may involve significant\nuncertainty and execution complexity, which\nmay cause us not to achieve our strategic\nobjectives, realize expected cost savings, or\nobtain other benefits from the divestiture.\nThe significant risks and uncertainties\ninvolved in divestitures may include:\n\n\u2022 the inability to sell such businesses or\nassets on satisfactory price and terms and in\na timely manner, including potentially long\nand costly sales processes and unsuccessful\nattempts by a buyer to receive required\nregulatory approvals, satisfy other conditions\nto closing, or obtain equity or debt financing\nin order to satisfy its payment obligations\nrelated to the transaction,\n\n\u2022 disruption to other parts of our business\nand distraction of management,\n\n\u2022 loss of key teammates or clients,\n\n\u2022 exposure to contingencies, including, among\nother things, those arising from\nrepresentations and warranties made to a buyer\nregarding the businesses being sold, or\n\n\u2022 ongoing obligations to support the\nbusinesses following such divestitures,\nincluding through transition services\narrangements, and other adverse financial\nimpacts.\n\nWhether such divestitures are completed or\nnot, their pendency could have a number of\nnegative effects on our current business,\nincluding potentially disrupting our regular\noperations and diverting the attention of our\nworkforce and management team. It could also\ndisrupt existing business relationships, make\nit harder to develop new business\nrelationships, or otherwise negatively impact\nthe way that we operate our business. In the\nevent of a termination of a divestiture\ntransaction before it is consummated, the\npayment of a termination fee may not fully\ncompensate us for our losses.\n\nTruist has businesses other than banking that\nare subject to a variety of risks.\n\nTruist is a diversified financial services\ncompany. This diversity subjects the Company\u2019s\nearnings to a broader variety of risks and\nuncertainties. Other businesses in addition to\nbanking that the Company operates include\ninsurance brokerage, investment banking,\nsecurities underwriting and market making,\nloan syndications, investment management and\nadvice and retail and wholesale brokerage\nservices offered through the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries. These businesses entail\nsignificant market, operational, credit,\ncompliance, technology, legal and other risks\nthat could adversely impact the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risks                          \n                                              \nNegative public opinion, whether real or\nperceived, or our failure to successfully\nmanage it could damage the Company\u2019s\nreputation and adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects.\n\nTruist\u2019s earnings, capital, and stock price\nare subject to risks associated with negative\npublic opinion. Negative public opinion could\nresult from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged\nconduct in any number of activities, including\nlending, sales and other operating practices,\ncorporate governance, acquisitions, a breach\nof client or teammate information, the failure\nof any product or service sold to meet\nclients\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory\nrequirements. In addition, the public\nperception that a cyberattack on the Company\u2019s\nsystems has been successful, whether or not\nthis perception is correct, may damage the\nCompany\u2019s reputation with clients and third\nparties with whom the Company does business.\nThe compromise of personal information, in\nparticular, could result in identity theft and\ncause serious reputational harm. Any\ncybersecurity breaches, attacks and other\nsimilar incidents could significantly harm\nTruist\u2019s reputation, which could adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s financial condition and\nresults of operation.\n\nNegative public opinion could also result from\nincreased polarization of environmental and\nsocial considerations that may affect Truist\nand clients of Truist. The proliferation of\nsocial media may increase the likelihood that\nnegative public opinion from any of the real\nor perceived events discussed above could\nimpact our reputation and business. Negative\npublic opinion could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nclients and teammates and can result in\nlitigation and regulatory actions. Actual or\nalleged conduct by one of the Company\u2019s\nbusinesses can result in negative public\nopinion about the Company\u2019s other businesses.\nActual or alleged conduct by another financial\nservices company can result in negative public\nopinion about the financial services industry\nin general and, as a result, adversely affect\nTruist.\n\nOur efforts to identify, measure and monitor\nreputational risk and communicate, internally\nand externally, such risks to key\nstakeholders, may be ineffective, untimely, or\notherwise result in adverse effects on the\nCompany.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 37\nTruist may face reputational risks arising out\nof Truist\u2019s sales, training, incentive\ncompensation or business practices, products\nor services, or other activities of its\nteammates, representatives, or business\npartners.\n\nThe Company may face increased scrutiny of its\nsales and other business practices, training\npractices, incentive compensation design and\ngovernance, and quality assurance and client\ncomplaint resolution practices. There can be\nno assurance that the Company\u2019s processes and\nactions will meet regulatory standards or\nexpectations. Findings from self-identified or\nregulatory reviews may require responsive\nactions, including increased investments in\ncompliance systems and teammates or the\npayment of fines, penalties, increased\nregulatory assessments or client redress and\nmay increase legal or reputational risk\nexposures.\n                                              \n  Talent Management Risks                     \n                                              \nTruist depends on the experience and expertise\nof key teammates. If these individuals were to\nleave or change their roles without effective\nreplacements, our business and operations may\nsuffer.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, to a large\ndegree, on the continued services of executive\nofficers and other key teammates who have\nextensive experience in the industry. The\nCompany\u2019s business could be adversely impacted\nfrom the loss of key persons or failure to\nmanage a smooth transition to new teammates.\n\nWe could be harmed by an inability to attract,\ndevelop, retain, and motivate qualified\nteammates while effectively managing\nrecruiting and compensation costs amid highly\ncompetitive and rapidly changing market\nconditions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the ability\nto attract, develop, and retain high\nperforming, diverse and well-qualified\nteammates. The Company faces significant\ncompetition in the recruitment of highly\nmotivated teammates who can deliver Truist\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values. Changes in\nemployee preferences for work environments, in\nparticular the desire of teammates to work\nremotely for many or all of their hours, may\nimpact our ability to attract and retain\nqualified teammates in those areas of our\noperations that require a concentration of\nonsite personnel (e.g., call centers). The\nCompany\u2019s ability to execute its business\nstrategy and provide high quality service may\nsuffer if the Company is unable to recruit,\ndevelop, or retain a sufficient number of\nqualified teammates or if the costs of\nemployee compensation or benefits increase\nsubstantially. The U.S. banking agencies have\njointly issued comprehensive guidance designed\nto ensure that incentive compensation policies\ndo not undermine the safety and soundness of\nbanking organizations by encouraging teammates\nto take imprudent risks. This guidance\nsignificantly affects the amount, form, and\ncontext of incentive compensation that may be\nprovided to teammates and could negatively\naffect Truist\u2019s ability to compete for talent\nrelative to non-banking companies. The SEC\nfinalized its incentive compensation clawback\nrule which may result in additional costs and\nrestrictions on the form of the Company\u2019s\nincentive compensation.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on its ability,\nand the ability of key external parties, to\nmaintain appropriately staffed workforces and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health,\nand safety of employees.\n\nTruist\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products\nand services that meet the expectations of its\nclients, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on\nits ability to staff its operations\nappropriately and on the competence,\nintegrity, health, and safety of its\nteammates. Truist is similarly dependent on\nthe workforces of other parties on which its\noperations rely, including vendors and other\nservice providers. Truist\u2019s businesses could\nbe adversely affected by the ineffective\nimplementation of business decisions; any\nfailure to institute controls that\nappropriately address risks associated with\nbusiness activities; or to appropriately train\nteammates with respect to those risks and\ncontrols; or staffing shortages, particularly\nin tight labor markets. Changes in law or\nregulation in jurisdictions in which our\noperations are located that affect employees\nmay also adversely affect our ability to hire,\ndevelop, and retain qualified teammates in\nthose jurisdictions. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s business could be adversely impacted\nby a significant operational breakdown or\nfailure, theft, fraud or other unlawful\nconduct, or other negative outcomes caused by\nhuman error or misconduct by a teammate of\nTruist or an employee of another party on\nwhich Truist\u2019s operations depend. Truist\u2019s\noperations could also be impaired if the\nmeasures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to help ensure the health and\nsafety of its teammates are ineffective, or if\nany external party on which Truist relies\nfails to take appropriate and effective\nactions to protect the health and safety of\nits employees.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nOur business and operations make extensive use\nof models, and we could be adversely affected\nif our design, implementation, or use of\nmodels is flawed.\n\nTruist relies on models to measure risks,\nestimate certain financial values, and inform\ncertain business decisions. Models may be used\nin such processes as determining the pricing\nof various products, grading loans and\nextending credit, measuring interest rate and\nother market risks, predicting or estimating\nlosses, assessing capital adequacy and\ncalculating economic and regulatory capital\nlevels, as well as estimating the value of\nfinancial instruments and balance sheet items.\n\n38 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPoorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly\nused models present the risk that certain\nTruist business decisions may be adversely\naffected by inappropriate model output. In\naddition, models based on historical data may\ndegrade over time due to limited historical\npatterns, extreme or unanticipated market\nmovements or client behavior and liquidity,\nespecially during severe market downturns or\nstress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic\nevents). Also, information Truist provides to\nthe public or to its regulators based on\npoorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly\nused models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nCertain decisions that the regulators make,\nincluding those related to capital\ndistributions to Truist\u2019s shareholders, could\nbe adversely affected due to the perception of\ninsufficient model quality or incorrect model\nuse.\n\nWe use estimates and assumptions in\ndetermining the value or amount of many of our\nassets and liabilities, and our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects could be adversely affected if\nthese prove to be incorrect.\n\nAccounting policies and processes are\nfundamental to how the Company records and\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require the\nuse of estimates and assumptions that may\naffect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or\nliabilities and financial results. Several of\nthe Company\u2019s accounting policies are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective, and complex judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain\nand because it is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported under\ndifferent conditions or using different\nassumptions. If assumptions or estimates\nunderlying the Company\u2019s financial statements\nare incorrect or are adjusted periodically,\nthe Company may experience material losses.\n\nManagement has identified certain accounting\npolicies as being critical because they\nrequire management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the\nvaluations of assets, liabilities,\ncommitments, and contingencies. A variety of\nfactors could affect the realization of income\nand expense or the recognition of assets and\nliabilities in the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements. Truist has established detailed\npolicies and procedures that are intended to\nensure these critical accounting estimates and\njudgments are well controlled and applied\nconsistently. In addition, the policies and\nprocedures are intended to ensure that the\nprocess for changing methodologies occurs in\nan appropriate manner. Due to the uncertainty\nsurrounding the Company\u2019s judgments and the\nestimates pertaining to these matters, the\nCompany cannot guarantee that adjustments to\naccounting policies or restatement of prior\nperiod financial statements will not be\nrequired.\n\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC\nchange the financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that govern the preparation of the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements. In addition,\naccounting standard setters and those who\ninterpret the accounting standards may change\nor even reverse their previous interpretations\nor positions on how these standards should be\napplied. Changes in financial accounting and\nreporting standards and changes in current\ninterpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol, can be hard to predict and could\nmaterially affect how the Company reports its\nfinancial results and condition. In some\ncases, the Company could be required to apply\na new or revised standard retroactively,\nresulting in the restatement of prior period\nfinancial statements.\n\nDepressed market values for the Company\u2019s\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company\u2019s goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is periodically tested for impairment\nby comparing the fair value of each reporting\nunit to its carrying amount. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. The fair value of a reporting unit\nis impacted by the reporting unit\u2019s expected\nfinancial performance and susceptibility to\nadverse economic, regulatory, and legislative\nchanges. Based on the Company\u2019s annual\nimpairment test of goodwill, it was determined\nfor the CB&W and C&CB reporting units that the\nrespective reporting units\u2019 carrying value was\nin excess of its respective fair value as of\nOctober 1, 2023, resulting in a $6.1 billion\nnon-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill\nimpairment charge for the year ended December\n31, 2023. Future adverse changes in economic\nconditions or expected financial performance\nmay cause the fair value of a reporting unit\nto be below its carrying amount, resulting in\nan additional goodwill impairment charge. The\nestimated fair values of the individual\nreporting units are assessed for\nreasonableness by reviewing a variety of\nindicators, including comparing these\nestimated fair values to the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime. While this comparison provides some\nrelative market information about the\nestimated fair value of the reporting units,\nit is not determinative and needs to be\nevaluated in the context of the current\neconomic environment. However, significant and\nsustained declines in the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization could be an indication of\npotential goodwill impairment. Refer to the\n\u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d section for\nadditional details related to the Company\u2019s\nintangible assets and goodwill.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 39\n                                              \n  Operational Risks                           \n                                              \nTruist relies extensively on other companies\nto provide key components of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness infrastructure, and their failure to\nperform to our standards or other issues of\nconcern with them could harm us.\n\nThird parties provide key components of the\nCompany\u2019s business infrastructure, such as\nbanking services, data processing, business\nprocesses, internet connections, and network\naccess. While we have implemented a supplier\nrisk management program and can exert varying\ndegrees of influence over our service\nproviders, we do not control them, their\nactions, or their businesses. Our contracts\nwith service providers, moreover, may not\nrequire or sufficiently incent them to perform\nat levels and in ways that we would choose to\nact on our own. Despite our supplier-risk-\nmanagement program, service providers have not\nalways met our requirements and expectations,\nand no assurance can be provided that in the\nfuture they will perform to our standards,\nadequately represent our brand, comply with\napplicable law, appropriately manage their own\nrisks, including cybersecurity, remain\nfinancially or operationally viable, abide by\ntheir contractual obligations, or continue to\nprovide us with the services that we require.\nDisruption in services provided by these third\nparties or any failure of these third parties\nto handle current or higher volumes of use\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability\nto deliver products and services to clients,\nto support teammates and otherwise to conduct\nbusiness. Technological or financial\ndifficulties of a third-party service provider\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s business\nto the extent those difficulties result in the\ninterruption or discontinuation of services\nprovided by that party. Further, in some\ninstances, the Company may be responsible for\nfailures of such third parties to comply with\ngovernment regulations. We may need to incur\nsubstantial expenses to address issues with a\nservice provider, and if the issues cannot be\nacceptably resolved, we may not be able to\ntimely or effectively replace the service\nprovider due to contractual restrictions, the\nunavailability of acceptable alternative\nproviders, or other reasons. Further,\nregardless of how much we can influence our\nservice providers, issues of concern with them\ncould result in supervisory actions and\nprivate litigation against us and could harm\nour reputation, business, and financial\nresults.\n\nThe Company is not insured against all types\nof losses as a result of third-party failures,\nand the insurance coverage that does exist may\nbe inadequate to protect the Company from all\nlosses resulting from system failures or other\ndisruptions. Failures in the Company\u2019s\nbusiness infrastructure could interrupt its\noperations or increase the costs of doing\nbusiness.\n\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks and\nmitigating losses may not be effective.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks\nto mitigate risk and loss. Truist has\nestablished policies, processes, and\nprocedures intended to identify, measure,\nmonitor, report, and analyze the types of risk\nto which the Company is subject, including\nliquidity, credit, market, operational,\ntechnology, reputational, strategic, and\ncompliance risk, among others. We continuously\nimprove the risk-management framework in\nresponse to internal reviews and assessments,\nevolving industry practices, and changes in\nbusiness and regulatory expectations. Even\nwith these improvements, however, the\nframework cannot guarantee that we will\neffectively mitigate risk and limit losses in\nour business and operations. For example, the\nCompany\u2019s risk management measures may not be\nfully effective in identifying and mitigating\nthe Company\u2019s risk exposure in all market\nenvironments or against all types of risk,\nincluding risks that are unidentified or\nunanticipated, even if the frameworks for\nassessing risk are properly designed and\nimplemented. Some of the Company\u2019s methods of\nmanaging risk are based upon the Company\u2019s use\nof observed historical market behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. These methods may not\naccurately predict future exposures, which\ncould be significantly greater than historical\nmeasures indicate. If the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework proves ineffective, it\ncould suffer unexpected losses and could be\nadversely affected.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist depends on the accuracy\nand completeness of information about clients\nand counterparties.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist relies on the\ncompleteness and accuracy of representations\nmade by and information furnished by or on\nbehalf of clients and counterparties,\nincluding financial statements and other\nfinancial information. If the information\nprovided is not accurate or complete, the\nCompany\u2019s decisions about extending credit or\nentering into other transactions with clients\nor counterparties could be adversely affected,\nand the Company could suffer defaults, credit\nlosses or other negative consequences as a\nresult.\n\n40 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks\nassociated with the introduction of or changes\nto products, services, and delivery platforms.\n\nWhen Truist launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services\n(including mobile connectivity, electronic\ntrading and cloud computing), acquires or\ninvests in a business or makes changes to an\nexisting product, service or delivery\nplatform, it may not fully appreciate or\nidentify new operational risks that may arise\nfrom those changes, or may fail to implement\nadequate controls to mitigate the risks\nassociated with those changes. Any significant\nfailure in this regard could diminish Truist\u2019s\nability to operate one or more of its\nbusinesses or result in potential liability to\nclients and counterparties, and result in\nincreased operating expenses. The Company\ncould also experience higher litigation costs,\nincluding regulatory fines, penalties and\nother sanctions, reputational damage,\nimpairment of Truist\u2019s liquidity, regulatory\nintervention, or weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could and\nadversely affect Truist\u2019s businesses and\nresults of operations.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for\nthe oversight of vendors and other service\nproviders can result in higher costs and other\npotential exposures.\n\nThe Company must comply with enhanced\nregulatory and other standards associated with\ndoing business with vendors and other service\nproviders, including standards relating to the\noutsourcing of functions as well as the\nperformance of significant banking and other\nfunctions by subsidiaries. Truist incurs\nsignificant costs and expenses in connection\nwith its initiatives to address the risks\nassociated with oversight of its internal and\nexternal service providers. Truist\u2019s failure\nto appropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those involving\nsignificant banking functions, shared services\nor other critical activities, could adversely\naffect Truist. Specifically, any such failure\ncould result in: potential harm to clients,\nand any liability associated with that harm;\nregulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions; lower revenues, and the opportunity\ncost from lost revenues; increased operational\ncosts, or harm to Truist\u2019s reputation.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 1C.

Truist\u2019s ability to\ngenerate liquid assets for distribution is\ndependent on the ability of Truist Bank to pay\ndividends to the Parent Company. The payment\nof cash dividends is an integral part of\nproviding a competitive return on\nshareholders\u2019 investments and needs to be\nbalanced with maintaining sufficient capital\nto support future growth and meet regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nManagement\u2019s target common dividend payout\nratio (computed by dividing common stock\ndividends by net income available to common\nshareholders) is between 30% and 50% during\nnormal economic conditions. Truist paid $2.8\nbillion, $2.7 billion, and $2.5 billion in\ncommon stock dividends during 2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively. Truist expects common\ndividend declarations, if made, to occur in\nJanuary, April, July, and October with payment\ndates on or about the first of March, June,\nSeptember, and December. A discussion of\ndividend restrictions is included in \u201cNote 17.\nRegulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\u201d and in the \u201cRegulatory\nConsiderations\u201d section.\n                                              \n  Share Repurchases                           \n                                              \nTruist has periodically repurchased shares of\nits own common stock and expects to\nperiodically repurchase shares in the future\nunder publicly announced repurchase plans. In\naccordance with North Carolina law,\nrepurchased shares cannot be held as treasury\nstock, but revert to the status of authorized\nand unissued shares upon repurchase and are\ntherefore available for future issuances.\nRepurchases may be effected through open\nmarket purchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions, trading plans established in\naccordance with SEC rules, or other means. The\ntiming and exact amount of repurchases are\nsubject to various factors, including the\nCompany\u2019s capital position, liquidity,\naccounting and regulatory considerations,\nincluding any restrictions that may be imposed\nby the FRB, financial and operational\nperformance, alternative uses of capital,\nstock trading price and general market\nconditions, and may be modified, extended,\ndiscontinued, or resumed at any time. In\naddition to shares purchased under publicly\nannounced repurchase plans, Truist repurchased\nshares in connection with the exercise of\nequity-based awards under equity-based\ncompensation plans. Truist did not have any\nshare repurchases for 2023 and repurchased\n$250 million and $1.6 billion in common stock\nin 2022 and 2021, respectively, pursuant to\npublicly announced repurchase plans.\n\nThe following table provides additional\ninformation on share repurchases as part of\npublicly announced plans and shares exchanged\nor surrendered in connection with the exercise\nof equity-based awards:\n                                              \n  Ta\u2026                                         \n  5:                                          \n  Sh\u2026                                   App\u2026  \n  Re\u2026                                   Dol\u2026  \n  Ac\u2026                       Total       Val\u2026  \n  (D\u2026                       Numb\u2026       of    \n  in                        of          Sha\u2026  \n  mi\u2026                       Shar\u2026       that  \n  ex\u2026                       Purc\u2026       may   \n  per                       as          yet   \n  sh\u2026    Tot\u2026       Ave\u2026    part        be    \n  da\u2026    Num\u2026       Pri\u2026    of          Pur\u2026  \n  sh\u2026      of       Paid    Publ\u2026       Und\u2026  \n  in     Sha\u2026        Per    Anno\u2026       the   \n  th\u2026    Pur\u2026       Sha\u2026    Plans       Pla\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Oc\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  to       11    $  27.\u2026    \u2014        $  \u2014     \n  Oc\u2026                                         \n  31,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n  No\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  to        \u2014       31.\u2026    \u2014           \u2014     \n  No\u2026                                         \n  30,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  to        \u2014          \u2014    \u2014           \u2014     \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n  To\u2026      11       27.\u2026    \u2014                 \n                                              \n(1) Includes shares exchanged or surrendered\nin connection with the exercise of equity-\nbased awards under equity-based compensation\nplans.\n\n(2) Excludes commissions.\n\n42 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Preferred Stock                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Redemptions                                 \n                                              \nDuring 2021, the Company redeemed all 18,000\noutstanding shares of its perpetual preferred\nstock series F and the corresponding\ndepositary shares representing fractional\ninterests in such series for $450 million, all\n20,000 outstanding shares of its perpetual\npreferred stock series G and the corresponding\ndepositary shares representing fractional\ninterests in such series for $500 million, and\nall 18,600 outstanding shares of its perpetual\npreferred stock series H and the corresponding\ndepositary shares representing fractional\ninterests in such series for $465 million.\n\nThese preferred stock redemptions were in\naccordance with the terms of the Company\u2019s\nArticles of Incorporation.\n\nSee \u201cNote 12.

For discussion of 2022 results as\ncompared to 2021 results, see \u201cItem 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d\nin the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\n\nA description of certain factors that may\naffect our future results and risk factors is\nset forth in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors of\nthis report.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nUnderlying results were positive for 2023\ndespite economic uncertainty stemming from\nbank failures in the first half of 2023.\nTruist withstood the market stress by leaning\non its strong core deposit base, ample\nliquidity, and diverse revenue streams across\nmultiple businesses. Results for 2023 included\nseveral discrete items, including a non-cash\ngoodwill impairment charge that has no impact\non our regulatory capital ratios, liquidity,\nability to pay the common dividend, or service\nour clients.\n\nWe grew the number of new consumer and\nbusiness checking accounts, experienced\nanother strong year of growth in our insurance\nbusiness, gained share in capital markets, and\ndeepened our relationships with clients\nthrough Integrated Relationship Management,\nBusiness Lifecycle Advisory, and digital\nchannels.\n\nWe also committed nearly $2.1 billion to\nsupport more than 15,000 units of affordable\nhousing through Truist Community Capital,\nwhich helped create more than 15,000 jobs, and\nserve more than 130,000 people in low- and\nmoderate-income communities in 2023. Teammates\nimpacted 5,300 organizations and causes\nthrough their charitable giving and more than\n62,000 hours of volunteer service. In\naddition, we started a Small Business\nCommunity Heroes initiative which empowers our\nbranch teammates to proactively connect via\ncaring conversations with small business\nowners who work tirelessly to serve our\nneighbors, create jobs, build our communities,\nand help drive our economy.\n\nIn addition, we unveiled an organizational\nsimplification and cost savings plan in\nSeptember 2023 aimed at limiting expenses in\n2024 and beyond and simplifying our\norganization to gain efficiencies that will\nimprove the client experience. Our\ntransformation is centered on improving\nefficiency as an organization and realigning\ncertain aspects of our leadership and\noperating model within our operating segments\nto increase efficiency and drive revenue\nopportunities. We made strong progress on our\nplan in the second half of 2023 as evidenced\nby a reduction in our headcount and the\nconsolidation of several key business lines.\n\nWe accomplished all of this in 2023, while\nalso strengthening our balance sheet. We added\n110 basis points of CET1 to finish the year\nwith a CET1 ratio of 10.1% through a\ncombination of organic capital generation and\nthe minority stake sale in our insurance\nbusiness, partially offset by the CECL phase\nin. Although we are committed to building\ncapital, our balance sheet remains open to\ncore clients as our primary capital priorities\nare supporting the financial needs of new and\nexisting clients and the payment of our common\ndividend. Asset quality continues to\nnormalize, but remains in-line relative to our\nexpectations and allowance coverage ratios.\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Truist announced changes\nto its Board of Directors. On December 31,\n2023, directors Kelly S. King, Nido R. Qubein,\nDavid M. Ratcliffe and Thomas N. Thompson\nretired due to these directors reaching\nTruist\u2019s mandatory retirement age. In\naddition, Board members Anna R. Cablik, Paul\nD. Donahue, Easter A. Maynard and Frank P.\nScruggs, Jr. decided to conclude their service\nas directors effective as of December 31,\n2023. The Board and Truist\u2019s management\nexpress their deep appreciation to these\ndirectors for their dedicated service and many\nsignificant contributions to Truist.\n\nEffective January 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned within the segments.\nFirst, the CB&W segment was renamed Consumer\nand Small Business Banking and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed Wholesale Banking. Second,\nthe Wealth business was repositioned into a\ncomponent of the Wholesale Banking segment\nfrom the CB&W segment. Third, certain small\nbusiness banking functions were repositioned\ninto a component of the Consumer and Small\nBusiness Banking segment from the C&CB\nsegment.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 45\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining 80% stake\nof the common equity in TIH to an investor\ngroup led by Stone Point Capital LLC for a\npurchase price that implies an enterprise\nvalue for TIH of $15.5 billion, and is\nexpected to result in cash proceeds to Truist\nof approximately $10.1 billion after-tax,\nreflecting certain closing adjustments for\ncash, debt and debt-like items, including the\nsettlement of certain previously granted TIH\nawards, working capital, transaction expenses\nand an investor return amount associated with\nthe originally sold 20% stake. The transaction\nimproves Truist\u2019s relative capital position\nand allows Truist to maintain strategic\nflexibility. The transaction is expected to\nclose in the second quarter of 2024, subject\nto customary closing conditions and regulatory\napprovals. Upon closing, the transaction will\nresult in a full deconsolidation of the TIH\nsubsidiary from Truist, and an expected gain\nequal to the excess of after-tax cash proceeds\nover Truist\u2019s approximate $5.4 billion\ninvestment in its TIH subsidiary.\n                                              \n  Key Areas of Focus                          \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s business is dynamic and complex.\nConsequently, management annually evaluates\nand, as necessary, adjusts the Company\u2019s\nbusiness strategy in the context of the\ncurrent operating environment. During this\nprocess, management considers the current\nfinancial condition and performance of the\nCompany and its expectations for future\neconomic activity from both a national and\nlocal market perspective. Achieving key\nstrategic objectives and long-term financial\ngoals is subject to many uncertainties and\nchallenges. In the opinion of management, the\nfollowing are the key areas of focus most\nlikely to impact Truist\u2019s near to medium term\nperformance:\n\n\u2022 Completing our transformation into a\nsimpler, more efficient, and client-centric\norganization with leading financial results;\n\n\u2022 Leveraging our existing platforms and\nincreasing our efficiencies to gain market\nshare;\n\n\u2022 Focusing on integrated relationship\nmanagement to deepen relationships with core\nclients, improve client experiences, and\ndeliver the bank as One Team;\n\n\u2022 Digitizing the enterprise through our \u201cT3\nstrategy\u201d to create a world-class client\nexperience and streamline, simplify, and\nautomate processes and operations; and\n\n\u2022 Building capital and maintaining strong risk\ncontrols and asset quality metrics.\n\nIn addition, certain challenges and unforeseen\nevents could have a near term impact on\nTruist\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations. See the sections titled \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for\nadditional examples of such challenges.\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet loss to common shareholders totaled $1.5\nbillion, or $1.09 per share, for 2023,\ncompared to net income available to common\nshareholders of $5.9 billion, or $4.43 per\nshare, from the prior year.\n\n\u2022 Results for 2023 included a non-cash\ngoodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion\n($4.56 per share) which has no impact on our\nliquidity, regulatory capital ratios, or our\nability to pay our common dividend and service\nour clients\u2019 financial needs; the FDIC special\nassessment of $507 million ($387 million\nafter-tax, or $0.29 per share); merger-related\nand restructuring charges of $375 million\n($286 million after-tax, or $0.21 per share);\nand a discrete tax benefit of $204 million\n($0.15 per share).\n\n\u2022 Results for 2022 included merger-related and\nrestructuring charges of $513 million ($393\nmillion after-tax, or $0.29 per share);\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger of $465 million ($356 million after-\ntax, or $0.27 per share); a gain on the\nredemption of noncontrolling equity interest\nof $74 million ($57 million after-tax, or\n$0.04 per share) related to the acquisition of\ncertain merchant services relationships; net\nlosses on the sales of securities of $71\nmillion ($54 million after-tax, or $0.04 per\nshare); and a gain on the early extinguishment\nof long-term debt of $39 million ($30 million\nafter-tax, or $0.02 per share).\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n46 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist\u2019s revenue for 2023 was $23.4 billion.\nOn a TE basis, revenue was $23.6 billion,\nwhich represents an increase of $433 million\ncompared to 2022. Net interest income on a TE\nbasis was $14.8 billion, up $362 million, or\n2.5%, primarily due to higher market interest\nrates and higher average loans. These\nincreases were partially offset by higher\nfunding costs and lower purchase accounting\naccretion.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets increased $13.5\nbillion, or 2.8%, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to growth in average total loans\nof $15.5 billion, or 5.1%, and growth in other\nearning assets of $9.3 billion, or 46%,\nprimarily due to an increase in balances held\nat the Federal Reserve to support liquidity\nbuild, partially offset by a $10.3 billion, or\n7.0%, decrease in average securities.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $17.0 billion, or\n4.1%, compared to the prior year while average\nshort-term borrowings increased $9.5 billion,\nor 64%, and average long-term debt increased\n$15.5 billion, or 45%.\n\nNoninterest income was up $71 million, or\n0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023\ncompared to 2022 due to higher insurance\nincome and lending related fees, partially\noffset by lower investment banking and trading\nincome, service charges on deposits and other\nincome. The prior year included $71 million of\nsecurities losses and a $74 million gain on\nthe redemption of noncontrolling equity\ninterest (other income).\n\nNIM was 3.00% for 2023, down one basis point\ncompared to the prior year. NIM was negatively\nimpacted by lower purchase accounting\naccretion, which benefited NIM by 5 basis\npoints in 2023 compared to 13 basis points in\n2022, partially offset by higher rates.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.12% for 2023, up 176 basis\npoints, compared to the prior year primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion. The yield on the average securities\nportfolio was 2.24% for 2023, up 36 basis\npoints compared to the prior year.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was 1.58%\nfor 2023, up 131 basis points compared to the\nprior year. The average cost of short-term\nborrowings was 5.25% for 2023, up 267 basis\npoints compared to the prior year. The average\ncost on long-term debt was 4.46% for 2023, up\n215 basis points compared to the prior year.\nThe increases in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.1\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2023\ncompared to $777 million in 2022. The net\ncharge-off ratio for the current year of 0.50%\nwas up 23 basis points compared to the prior\nyear.\n\n\u2022 The increase in the current period provision\nexpense primarily reflects an allowance build\nand higher net charge-offs.\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off ratio was up compared to\nthe prior year driven by higher charge-offs in\nthe commercial and industrial, CRE, indirect\nauto, other consumer, and credit card\nportfolios as well as the sale of the student\nloan portfolio.\n\nNoninterest expense was up $6.9 billion for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 compared to\n2022 due to goodwill impairment of $6.1\nbillion, higher regulatory costs primarily due\nto the FDIC special assessment of $507\nmillion, higher other expense, and higher\npersonnel expense, partially offset by lower\nmerger-related and restructuring charges,\nprofessional fees and outside processing\nexpenses, equipment expense, marketing and\ncustomer development expense, and amortization\nof intangibles. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and incremental\noperating expenses related to the merger\ndecreased $138 million and $465 million,\nrespectively, due to the completion of\nintegration-related activities. Merger-related\nand restructuring charges for the current year\ninclude increased severance charges due to the\nongoing transformation efforts as well as the\ncontinuation of specific facilities\noptimization costs. The prior period also\nincluded a gain on the redemption of FHLB\nadvances of $39 million (other expense).\nAdjusted noninterest expenses, which exclude\ngoodwill impairment, the FDIC special\nassessment, merger-related costs, the\namortization of intangibles, and gains and\nlosses on the early extinguishment of debt,\nincreased $908 million, or 6.9%.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $862\nmillion for 2023, compared to $1.4 billion to\n2022. The decrease in the provision for income\ntaxes was primarily driven by lower pre-tax\nearnings, which includes a non-deductible\ngoodwill impairment, and a discrete tax\nbenefit of $204 million.\n\nTruist\u2019s total assets at December 31, 2023\nwere $535.3 billion, a decrease of $19.9\nbillion, or 3.6%, compared to December 31,\n2022 as loans and leases, net of ALLL,\ndecreased $14.4 billion, or 4.5%, total\nsecurities decreased $8.0 billion, or 6.2%,\nreflecting our ongoing balance sheet\noptimization efforts, as well as the\naforementioned goodwill impairment, partially\noffset by an increase of $9.5 billion, or\n59.4%, in interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks.\n\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2023 were\n$476.1 billion, a decrease of $18.6 billion,\nor 3.8%, from the prior year, reflecting a\ndecrease of $17.6 billion, or 4.3%, in\ndeposits and a decrease of $4.3 billion, or\n9.9%, in long-term debt, partially offset by\nan increase of $1.4 billion, or 6.0%, in\nshort-term borrowings.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity was $59.3 billion\nat December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.3\nbillion from December 31, 2022. This decrease\nincludes $3.1 billion in common and preferred\ndividends and a $1.0 billion net loss,\npartially offset by $1.4 billion received in\nconnection with the TIH minority stake sale,\nnet of tax, and $1.1 billion in OCI. Truist\u2019s\nbook value per common share at December 31,\n2023 was $39.31, compared to $40.58 at\nDecember 31, 2022. Truist\u2019s TBVPS of $21.83 at\nDecember 31, 2023, increased 21% compared to\nDecember 31, 2022.\n\nAsset quality reflects normalization and\nmodest deterioration in commercial portfolios.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment were 0.44% of loans and leases held\nfor investment at December 31, 2023, up eight\nbasis points compared to December 31, 2022.\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses was $5.1\nbillion and includes $4.8 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $295\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.54%, up 20\nbasis points compared with December 31, 2022.\n\nCapital strengthened during 2023.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s CET1 ratio was 10.1% as of December\n31, 2023. The 110 basis point increase since\nDecember 31, 2022 resulted from organic\ncapital generation and the minority stake sale\nin TIH, partially offset by the CECL phase in.\n\n\u2022 Truist declared common dividends of $2.08\nper share during 2023. Truist did not\nrepurchase any shares in 2023.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s average consolidated LCR was 112%\nfor the three months ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 was up $362\nmillion, or 2.5%, compared to 2022 primarily\ndue to higher market interest rates and higher\naverage loans. These increases were partially\noffset by higher funding costs and lower\npurchase accounting accretion. Net interest\nmargin was 3.00% for 2023, down one basis\npoint compared to the prior year. NIM was\nnegatively impacted by lower purchase\naccounting accretion, which benefited NIM by 5\nbasis points in 2023 compared to 13 basis\npoints in 2022, partially offset by higher\nrates.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets increased $13.5\nbillion, or 2.8%, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to growth in average total loans\nof $15.5 billion, or 5.1%, and growth in other\nearning assets of $9.3 billion, or 46%,\nprimarily due to an increase in balances held\nat the Federal Reserve to support liquidity\nbuild, partially offset by a $10.3 billion, or\n7.0%, decrease in average securities.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.12% for 2023, up 176 basis\npoints, compared to the prior year primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion.

The average\ncost on long-term debt was 4.46% for 2023, up\n215 basis points compared to the prior year.\nThe increases in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio and long-term debt were $477\nmillion and $39 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized\nfair value marks on the loan and lease\nportfolio and long-term debt were $741 million\nand $81 million, respectively.\n\nThe remaining unamortized purchase accounting\nfair value mark on loans and leases consists\nof $349 million for consumer loans and leases,\nand $128 million for commercial loans and\nleases. These amounts will be recognized over\nthe remaining contractual lives of the\nunderlying instruments or as paydowns occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n\n48 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Represents daily average balances.\nExcludes basis adjustments for fair value\nhedges.\n\n(2) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

The 2023 merger-related\nand restructuring costs predominately reflect\nvarious restructuring initiatives, including\ncosts for severance and other benefits and\ncosts related to exiting facilities.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                         $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                         $    \n                                              \n(1) The Company recognized $368 million of\nexpense related to the Merger for the year\nended December 31, 2022. Merger integration\nactivities were completed in 2022.\n                                              \n  Segment Results                             \n                                              \nThrough December 31, 2023, Truist operated and\nmeasured business activities across three\nsegments: Consumer Banking and Wealth,\nCorporate and Commercial Banking, and\nInsurance Holdings, with functional activities\nincluded in Other, Treasury, and Corporate.\n\nIn 2023, Truist realigned Prime Rate Premium\nFinance Corporation, which includes AFCO\nCredit Corporation and CAFO Holding Company,\ninto the C&CB segment from the IH segment.\nPrior period results have been revised to\nconform to the current presentation.\nAdditionally, Truist updated its segment cost\nallocation methodology. Results for 2023 have\nbeen revised to conform to the current\npresentation. Management concluded the impact\nto 2022 was not material.\n\nEffective January 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned within the segments.\nFirst, the CB&W segment was renamed Consumer\nand Small Business Banking and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed Wholesale Banking. Second,\nthe Wealth business was repositioned into a\ncomponent of the Wholesale Banking segment\nfrom the CB&W segment. Third, certain small\nbusiness banking functions were repositioned\ninto a component of the Consumer and Small\nBusiness Banking segment from the C&CB\nsegment. The Company\u2019s business segment\nstructure is based on the manner in which\nfinancial information is evaluated by\nmanagement as well as the products and\nservices provided or the type of client\nserved.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The application and development of\nmanagement reporting methodologies is an\nactive process and undergoes periodic\nenhancements. The implementation of these\nenhancements to the internal management\nreporting methodology may materially affect\nthe results disclosed for each segment, with\nno impact on consolidated results. When\nsignificant changes to management reporting\nmethodologies take place, the impact of these\nchanges is quantified and prior period\ninformation is revised.\n\nIn conjunction with the Company\u2019s April 3,\n2023 sale of a 20% stake of the common equity\nin TIH, TIH issued $5 billion of 8.25%\nmandatorily redeemable preferred units to the\nCompany, with the related interest expense,\nwhich is fully allocable to the Company,\nreported in Net intersegment interest income\n(expense). TIH is the principal legal entity\nof the IH segment.\n\nAlso related to the same transaction, TIH was\nrecapitalized from a corporate entity to an\nLLC, such that each member is allocated its\nshare of TIH\u2019s income before taxes, and\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2023 the\nCompany recognizes its associated income tax\nprovision through OT&C. The Company elected\nnot to restate prior periods for this change\nbased on TIH\u2019s previous status as a corporate\nentity. The Company recognized $110 million\nfor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nof tax provision related to IH in OT&C. IH\ncontinues to recognize certain state\njurisdictions that impose income taxes on\npartnerships and LLCs.\n\n52 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSee \u201cNote 21.

Excluding goodwill impairment,\nnoninterest expense increased $692 million due\nto higher corporate technology costs, the FDIC\nspecial assessment, and corporate operating\nand risk support expenses, partially offset by\nlower marketing and customer development,\nprofessional fees and outside processing, and\namortization of intangibles.\n\nCB&W average loans and leases held for\ninvestment increased $1.6 billion, or 1.2%,\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 compared\nto the prior year driven primarily by an\nincrease in residential mortgage and Service\nFinance loans, partially offset by the sale of\nthe student loan portfolio in second quarter\n2023 and a decrease in indirect auto loans.\n\nCB&W average total deposits decreased $15.7\nbillion, or 6.2%, for the year ended December\n31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to decreases in average interest-bearing\nchecking, money market and savings, and\nnoninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset\nby an

reflects an allowance\nbuild, higher charge offs, and loan growth in\nthe current period as well as an allowance\nrelease in the earlier period.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income decreased $324 million\nprimarily due to lower structured real estate\nfee income, higher derivative collateral\nrelated costs, lower commercial mortgage\nincome, and lower trading income, partially\noffset by increases in lending related fees,\nmerger and acquisition fees, and bond\noriginations.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $3.2 billion\nprimarily due to a goodwill impairment charge.\nExcluding goodwill impairment, noninterest\nexpense increased $483 million driven by the\nFDIC special assessment, higher corporate\ntechnology expenses, and merger-related and\nrestructuring charges, partially

continued organic growth and\nacquisitions.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense increased $389 million\nprimarily due to the impact of acquisitions,\ninvestments in new hires and teammates,\nindependence

loans and higher\nearnings on cash balances and in the\nsecurities portfolio driven by the higher rate\nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $197 million\nprimarily due to valuation changes from assets\nheld for certain post-retirement benefits in\nthe current period, which is primarily offset\nby higher personnel expense, and losses on the\nsale of securities in the earlier period.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense decreased $765 million\nprimarily due to a decrease in incremental\noperating expenses related to the Merger and\ncredit from other segments for corporate\ntechnology project support, partially offset\nby an increase in operating charge-offs due to\ncosts associated with changes in deposit\nservice fee protocols as well as settlement of\ncertain litigation matters, including a\nsettlement and patent licensing agreement that\nresolved the USAA remote deposit capture\npatent infringement lawsuit, and a gain on the\nredemption of

Management believes that this purpose\ncan best be accomplished by building strong\nclient relationships over time and developing\nin-depth local market knowledge. The Company\nemploys strict underwriting criteria governing\nthe degree of risk assumed and the diversity\nof the loan portfolio in terms of type,\nindustry, and geographical concentration.\n\nTruist lends to a diverse client base that is\ngeographically dispersed to mitigate\nconcentration risk arising from local and\nregional economic downturns. The following\ndiscussion provides additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolios. Refer\nto the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section for a\ndiscussion of the credit risk management\npolicies used to manage the portfolios.\n\nCommercial Loan and Lease Portfolio\n\nCommercial loans and leases represent the\nlargest category of the Company\u2019s loan and\nlease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking\nand small business banking generally target\nsmall-to-middle market businesses with annual\nsales between $2 million and $500 million,\nwhile CIB provides lending solutions to large\ncorporate clients. The commercial loan and\nlease portfolio consists of lending to public\nand private business clients and is composed\nof commercial and industrial, owner occupied,\nequipment leasing and financing, commercial\nreal estate, government and institutional\nfinancing, premium financing, and dealer floor\nplan financing.\n\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s lending\npolicy, each commercial loan undergoes a\ndetailed underwriting process. Commercial\nloans are typically priced with an interest\nrate tied to market indices, such as the prime\nrate or SOFR and are individually monitored\nand reviewed for deterioration in the ability\nof the client to repay the loan. The majority\nof Truist\u2019s commercial loans are secured by\nreal estate, business equipment, inventories,\nand other types of collateral.\n\nResidential Mortgage Loan Portfolio\n\nTruist primarily originates conforming\nmortgage loans, loans under FHA, U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, or U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture programs, and higher\nquality jumbo and construction-to-permanent\nloans for 1-4 family residential properties.\nConforming loans are loans that are\nunderwritten in accordance with the\nunderwriting standards set forth by FNMA and\nFHLMC. They are generally collateralized by\none-to-four-family residential real estate,\ntypically have loan-to-collateral value ratios\nof 80% or less at origination, or have\nmortgage insurance as required by investors\nand are made to borrowers in good credit\nstanding.\n\nRisks associated with mortgage lending include\ninterest rate risk, which is mitigated through\nthe sale of a substantial portion of\nconforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary\nmortgage market and an effective MSR hedging\nprocess. Credit risk is managed through\nrigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage\ninsurance. The right to service the loans and\nreceive servicing income is generally retained\nwhen conforming loans are sold. Management\nbelieves that the retention of mortgage\nservicing diversifies income while enabling\nTruist to build long-term client relationships\nand offer high quality client service. Truist\nalso purchases residential mortgage loans from\ncorrespondent originators. The loans purchased\nfrom third-party originators are subject to\nsubstantially the same underwriting and risk-\nmanagement criteria as loans originated\ninternally.\n\nHome Equity Loan Portfolio\n\nThe home equity portfolio is composed of loans\noffered through Truist\u2019s branch network. These\ninclude home equity loans and revolving home\nequity lines of credit secured by first or\nsecond liens on residential real estate in\nTruist\u2019s market areas.\n\nIndirect Auto Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect auto portfolio primarily includes\nsecured indirect installment loans to\nconsumers for the purchase of new and used\nautomobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also\nincludes nonprime and near prime automobile\nfinance. Such loans are originated through\napproved franchised and independent dealers\nthroughout the Truist market area and\nnationally through Regional Acceptance\nCorporation. These loans are homogeneous, and\nno single loan is individually significant in\nterms of its size and potential risk of loss.\nIndirect auto loans are subject to rigorous\nlending policies and procedures and are\nunderwritten with note amounts and credit\nlimits that are consistent with the Company\u2019s\nrisk philosophy. In addition to its normal\nunderwriting due diligence, Truist uses\napplication systems and scoring systems to\nhelp underwrite and manage the credit risk in\nits indirect auto portfolio.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\nOther Consumer Loan Portfolio\n\nThe other consumer portfolio includes loans\noriginated through the Truist branch network,\nas well as loans originated by Truist\u2019s\nnational online consumer lending division.\nLoans originated through the Truist branch\nnetwork include secured and unsecured lending\nmarketed to qualifying clients and other\ncreditworthy candidates in Truist\u2019s market\nareas. Truist provides fixed-rate, unsecured\nlending to consumers with strong credit\nthrough its proprietary online loan\norigination system. The other consumer\nportfolio includes secured indirect\ninstallment loans to consumers for the\npurchase of new and used boats and\nrecreational vehicles. The other consumer\nportfolio includes Sheffield, a small ticket\nconsumer lending division related to the\npurchase of power sports and outdoor power\nequipment, and trailers. These loans are\nhomogeneous, and no single loan is\nindividually significant in terms of its size\nand potential risk of loss. These loans are\nsubject to similar rigorous lending policies\nand procedures as the indirect auto loan\nportfolio. The other consumer loan portfolio\nalso includes other indirect and point-of-sale\nlending to consumers, including through\nService Finance, to finance home improvements,\nfurniture purchases, certain elective health-\ncare services, and other consumer products\nsegments. These loans are originated in\naccordance with strict underwriting criteria\nas determined by Truist.\n\nStudent Loan Portfolio\n\nThe student loan portfolio, which was sold in\n2023, was primarily composed of government\nguaranteed student loans and additionally\nincluded certain private student loans\noriginated by third parties. The government\nguarantee mitigated substantially all of the\nrisk related to principal and interest\nrepayment for this component of the portfolio.\n\nCredit Card Loan Portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio consists of the\noutstanding balances on credit cards. Truist\nmarkets credit cards to its existing client\nbase and does not solicit cardholders through\nnationwide programs or other forms of mass\nmarketing. Such balances are generally\nunsecured and actively managed.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 5.

                    \n  CRE and Commercial Construction             \n                                              \nTruist has noted that the CRE and commercial\nconstruction portfolios have the potential for\nheightened risk in the current environment.\nTruist maintains a high-quality portfolio\nthrough disciplined risk management and\nprudent client selection. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s exposure to large CRE tends to have\nmore institutional sponsorship and the Company\nhas reduced exposure to smaller CRE. Truist\u2019s\nCRE and commercial construction portfolios\ntotaled $29.3 billion as of December 31, 2023,\nwhich includes 33% related to multifamily\nresidential, 17% related to office, 17%\nrelated to industrial, 14% related to retail,\nand the remainder composed of hotel and other\ncommercial real estate.\n\nOur office and medical portfolios are\nprimarily composed of Class A, multi-tenant\nproperties located within Truist bank\u2019s\nfootprint. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 97% of these properties are\nmulti-tenant or medical, and within our top 10\nmarkets 64% and 25% of these exposures\nrepresent Class A and Class B properties,\nrespectively. Approximately 26% and 25% of\nthese exposures are scheduled to mature in\n2024 and 2025, respectively, with the\nremainder scheduled to mature in 2026 and\nbeyond. Truist maintains rigorous credit risk\nmanagement surveillance routines across all\nloan portfolios. During 2023, Truist performed\nmultiple reviews of the CRE office portfolio,\nwhich resulted in an increase in the ALLL for\nthis portfolio.\n                                              \n  \u2026

totaled $1.6\nbillion, or 0.50% as a percentage of average\nloans, and were up twenty-three basis points\ncompared to the prior year, primarily driven\nby higher charge-offs in the commercial and\nindustrial, CRE, indirect auto, other\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios as well\nas the sale of the student loan portfolio.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses was $5.1\nbillion and includes $4.8 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $295\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.54%,\ncompared to 1.34% at December 31, 2022. The\nincrease in the ALLL ratio primarily reflects\nan increase in reserves related to the CRE and\ncommercial construction portfolios, loan\ngrowth in the other consumer portfolio,\npartially offset by the sale of the student\nportfolio. The ALLL covered nonperforming\nloans and leases held for investment 3.5x\ncompared to 3.7x at December 31, 2022.

FHLB advances, other secured\nborrowings, Federal funds purchased and other\nshort-term borrowed funds, as well as long-\nterm debt issued through the capital markets,\nall provide supplemental liquidity sources.\nFunding activities are monitored and governed\nthrough Truist\u2019s overall ALM process under the\ngovernance and oversight of the MRLCC, which\nis further discussed in the \u201cMarket Risk\u201d\nsection in MD&A. The following section\nprovides a brief description of the various\nsources of funds.\n\nDeposits\n\nDeposits are obtained principally from\nindividuals and businesses within Truist\u2019s\ngeographic area and include noninterest-\nbearing checking accounts, interest-bearing\nchecking accounts, savings accounts, money\nmarket deposit accounts, CDs, and IRAs.\nDeposit account terms vary with respect to the\nminimum balance required, the time period the\nfunds must remain on deposit and service\ncharge schedules. Interest rates paid on\nspecific deposit types are determined based on\n(i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the\nanticipated amount and timing of funding\nneeds, (iii) the availability and cost of\nalternative sources of funding, and (iv)\nanticipated future economic conditions and\ninterest rates. Deposits are attractive\nsources of funding because of their stability\nand relative cost.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\ndeposits:\n                                              \n  Table 27:                                   \n  Deposits                                    \n  as of                                       \n  Period                                      \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Noninter\u2026    $     111,624    $    135,742  \n  deposits                                    \n  Interest           104,757         110,464  \n  checking                                    \n  Money                                       \n  market             135,923         143,815  \n  and                                         \n  savings                                     \n  Time                43,561          23,474  \n  deposits                                    \n  Total        $     395,865    $    413,495  \n  deposits                                    \n                                              \nDeposits totaled $395.9 billion at December\n31, 2023, a decrease of $17.6 billion from\nDecember 31, 2022. The decline in deposits\nreflects the impacts of monetary tightening,\ninflation, and higher interest rate\nalternatives, partially offset by growth in\ntime deposits, which reflects increases in\nvarious wholesale deposit products to support\nfunding. Brokered deposits were $31.3 billion\nat December 31, 2023 compared to $22.4 billion\nat December 31, 2022.\n\nTruist has a very granular and relationship-\nbased deposit franchise. Approximately 62% of\ndeposits are insured or collateralized at\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to 61% at December\n31, 2022. Truist deposit accounts are\ntypically based on long-term relationships and\ninclude multiple products and services. The\namount of deposits above the FDIC\u2019s limit of\n$250,000 was $175.1 billion and $189.6 billion\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, calculated using the same\nmethodology as the Call Report for Truist\nBank. The decrease in uninsured deposits from\nDecember 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was\nlargely due to commercial clients that chose\nto diversify into money market mutual funds or\nacross multiple banks (primarily higher-cost,\nnon-operational deposits) and the maturity of\nlarge denominated negotiable certificates of\ndeposit.\n\nThe following table summarizes the maturities\nof time deposit accounts above $250,000:\n                                              \n  Table 28: Scheduled                         \n  Maturities of Time Deposits                 \n  $250,000 and Greater                        \n  December 31, 2023                           \n  (Dollars in millions)                       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Three months or less             $   7,531  \n  Over three through six months        1,225  \n  Over six through twelve              1,592  \n  months                                      \n  Over twelve months                      74  \n  Total                            $  10,422  \n                                              \nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       S\u2026       \u2026       M\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n66 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nAverage deposits for the fourth quarter of\n2023 were $395.3 billion, a decrease of $5.7\nbillion, or 1.4%, compared to the prior\nquarter.\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n3.7% compared to the prior quarter and\nrepresented 29.0% of total deposits for the\nfourth quarter of 2023 compared to 29.6% for\nthe third quarter of 2023 and 34.1% compared\nto the year ago quarter.

Average\ntime deposits increased 1.6% due to increases\nin retail client time deposits, primarily due\nto migration from other deposit products,\npartially offset by a $2.1 billion decline in\nbrokered time deposits.\n\nBorrowings\n\nThe types of short-term borrowings that have\nbeen, or may be, used by the Company include\nFederal funds purchased, securities sold under\nrepurchase agreements, master notes,\ncommercial paper, short-term bank notes, and\nshort-term FHLB advances. Short-term\nborrowings fluctuate based on the Company\u2019s\nfunding needs.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework is designed to promote the execution\nof business strategies and objectives in\nalignment with its risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\nframework that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. Truist\nhas developed a risk taxonomy designed to\ndrive internal risk measurement and monitoring\nand enable Truist to clearly and transparently\ncommunicate to stakeholders the level of\npotential risk the Company faces and the\nCompany\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities must be evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nTruist\u2019s compensation plans are designed to\nconsider teammate\u2019s adherence to and\nsuccessful implementation of Truist\u2019s risk\nvalues and associated policies and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation structure is\ndesigned to support its core values and sound\nrisk management practices in an effort to\npromote judicious risk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist\u2019s purpose, mission, and values are the\nfoundation for the risk management framework\nutilized at Truist and therefore serve as the\nbasis on which the risk appetite and risk\nstrategy are built. Truist\u2019s RMO provides\nindependent oversight and guidance for risk-\ntaking across the enterprise. In keeping with\nthe belief that consistent values drive long-\nterm behaviors, Truist\u2019s RMO has established\nthe following risk values which are intended\nto guide teammates\u2019 day-to-day activities:\n\n\u2022 Managing risk is the responsibility of every\nteammate.\n\n\u2022 Proactively identifying risk and managing\nthe inherent risks of their businesses is the\nresponsibility of the business units.\n\n\u2022 Managing risk with a balanced approach which\nincludes quality, profitability, and growth.\n\n\u2022 Utilizing sound and consistent risk\nmanagement practices.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and\nqualitatively.\n\n\u2022 Realizing lower cost of capital from high\nquality risk management.\n\nTruist places significant emphasis on risk\nmanagement oversight and maintains a separate\nBoard-level Risk Committee, which assists the\nBoard in its oversight of the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement function. The Committee is\nresponsible for approving and periodically\nreviewing the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework and risk management policies as well\nas monitoring the Company\u2019s risk profile,\napproving risk appetite statements, and\nproviding input to management regarding\nTruist\u2019s risk appetite and risk profile.\n\nThe RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible\nfor overseeing the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring, management, and\nreporting of risk. The CRO has direct access\nto the Board to communicate any risk issues\n(current or emerging) as well as the\nperformance of the risk management activities\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\nAs illustrated below, the risk management\nframework is supported by three lines of\ndefense. The following figure describes the\nroles of the three lines of defense:\n\nTruist\u2019s Risk Governance framework is designed\nto provide comprehensive Board and management\nrisk oversight, maintaining a committee\ngovernance structure that is designed to\nensure alignment and execution of the risk\nmanagement framework. The committee structure\nprovides a mechanism to allow for efficient\naggregation and escalation of risk information\nfrom the business units up to the risk\nprograms, management and ultimately the Board.\nThe GCO standardizes first-line risk execution\nand ownership across the company in\npartnership with the business units and\nenterprise functions. As part of the first-\nline of defense, the GCO provides risk advice\nand effective challenge, issues management,\ntesting, reporting, and business continuity\nexpertise to first-line execution efforts. The\nGCO coordinates closely with the RMO to ensure\nproper program execution and regulatory\ncompliance.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\nTruist maintains a robust and comprehensive\nmanagement committee structure reporting to\nthe Truist Board of Directors, or Board\ncommittees thereof, that are responsible for\nproviding independent risk oversight of each\nof Truist\u2019s primary risk types and\ncomprehensive coverage of Truist\u2019s strategy,\nrisk-taking and execution activities. Examples\nof such committees include the ERC and\nManagement Compensation Oversight Committee.\n\nThe ERC serves as the enterprise-wide risk\ngovernance body authorized by the Risk\nCommittee of the Board of Directors with\nresponsibility for broad strategic oversight\nof all risk types and establishing a fully\nintegrated view of risks across Truist at the\nenterprise level. The ERC is responsible for\nmaintaining an effective risk management\nframework and monitoring its adoption and\nexecution across the enterprise. The ERC is\nchaired by the Vice Chair and Chief Risk\nOfficer and its membership includes the Chief\nExecutive Officer, Vice Chair and Chief\nOperating Officer, Chief Audit Officer, and\nother designated members of Truist management.\n\nPrincipal types of inherent risk include\nmarket, credit, liquidity, technology,\ncompliance, strategic, reputational, and\noperational risks. The following is a\ndiscussion of these risks.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTruist primarily monitors this risk through\ntwo measurement types, (i) net interest income\nat risk and (ii) economic value of equity, and\nmanages this risk with securities,\nderivatives, and broader asset liability\nmanagement activities.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNet interest income at risk measures changes\nin net interest income in alternate interest\nrate scenarios relative to Truist\u2019s baseline\nscenario, which relies on assumptions\nincluding expectations of the economy and\ninterest rates \u2013 which are influenced by\nmarket conditions, new business volume,\npricing, and client behavior. In measuring net\ninterest income at risk, Truist assumes that\nchanges in key factors, such as prepayments\nand deposit pricing (betas), largely move in\nline with those it has experienced in prior\nrate cycles. However, future behavior of key\nfactors used in this measurement may vary. Net\ninterest income at risk measurement assumes,\nwhen applicable, that U.S. interest rates will\nnot fall below zero.\n\nTruist evaluates a wide range of alternate\nscenarios including instantaneous and gradual\nas well as parallel and non-parallel changes\nin interest rates. The following table\nprovides additional information on the\nestimated change to net interest income over\nthe following 12 months for select parallel\nalternate scenarios, expressed as a percentage\nchange relative to baseline net interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  Table 32: Interest                          \n  Sensitivity Simulation                      \n  Analysis                   Dec 31, 2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Up 200bps gradual                           \n  change in interest                -1.46  %  \n  rates                                       \n  Up 50bps instantaneous                      \n  change in interest                -0.36     \n  rates                                       \n  Down 50bps                                  \n  instantaneous change in           -0.10     \n  interest rates                              \n  Down 200bps gradual                         \n  change in interest                -0.30     \n  rates                                       \n                                              \nEstimated changes to net interest income in\nthe previous table assume no change in deposit\nbalances or mix relative to the baseline\nscenario. In an increasing rate scenario,\nrotation from non-interest-bearing into\ninterest bearing deposits would reduce net\ninterest income. Conversely, in a down rate\nscenario, rotation from higher yielding to\nlower yielding deposits would benefit net\ninterest income. Truist performs and monitors\nsensitivity tests of deposit and other key\nassumptions used in interest rate risk.\n\nEconomic value of equity measures changes in\neconomic value of Truist\u2019s current balance\nsheet and off-balance sheet hedges under\nalternate rate scenarios relative to starting\neconomic value. Truist uses economic value of\nequity as a longer-term measure of interest\nrate risk.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nThe remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR\nceased publication of representative rates on\nJune 30, 2023, with only select tenors\nreceiving a synthetic publication through\nSeptember 30, 2024. Truist provided timely\nnotices and information to impacted clients\nabout the transition to new interest rates\npost cessation and had minimal use of\nsynthetic LIBOR to support the transition.\nMost contracts were transitioned to new rates\nin July and August 2023, in accordance with\nfallback language. A small number of contracts\nutilize longer tenor LIBOR rates and will\ntransition by early 2024 (6-month and 12-month\nLIBOR) based on contractual agreements. Truist\nhas materially completed LIBOR transition\nefforts, primarily utilizing SOFR replacement\nrates, and closed formal project efforts as of\nSeptember 2023.\n\nFallback language used to remediate loan\nagreements was generally consistent with ARRC\nrecommendations and included use of \u201chardwired\nfallback\u201d language, which transitioned loans\nto a SOFR based rate after June 30, 2023. For\na small number of wholesale contracts\nremaining without fallback language, Truist\nleveraged the LIBOR Act and corresponding safe\nharbor provision to transition these loans to\nSOFR. Truist\u2019s consumer lending portfolios\nincluded fallback language to transition to\nSOFR, based on lender discretion and as\nsupported by the LIBOR Act; therefore, these\ncontracts did not require remediation and also\nbenefit from the safe harbor provisions of the\nLIBOR Act.\n\nDerivatives that reference LIBOR transitioned\nto a SOFR-based replacement rate as set forth\nin the ISDA protocol addressing LIBOR\nfallbacks between the Company and its\ncounterparties which have adhered to the\nprotocol, through bilateral amendments between\nthe Company and each of its counterparties, or\nas established under the LIBOR Act and rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB. Fallback\nlanguage used to remediate LIBOR based\nderivatives was generally consistent with ISDA\npublications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s preferred securities and the\nCompany\u2019s and Truist Bank\u2019s floating rate\nnotes that reference LIBOR transitioned to a\nSOFR based rate utilizing application of the\nLIBOR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder\nby the FRB. Truist announced that these\nsecurities would move to a 3-month adjusted\nTerm SOFR in accordance with the LIBOR Act.\nSee \u201cNote 12. Shareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d for\ninformation about preferred stock using LIBOR.\n                                              \n  Market Risk from Trading Activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule,\nwhich were non-agency asset backed securities\npositions, was $49 million. Consistent with\nthe Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company\nperforms pre-purchase due diligence on each\nsecuritization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of December 31, 2023.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the 12 months\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026                          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n                $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  \n                   \u2026       7       \u2026       5  \n                   \u2026       4       6       3  \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       6  \n                                              \n                           5               6  \n                           2               8  \n                           5               1  \n                           1               \u2014  \n                           \u2026               \u2026  \n                           \u2026               6  \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRO policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for risk factor\nsensitivities, historical repeats and\nhypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity\nhorizons of key risk factors. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nCredit risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nthe default, unwillingness or inability of a\nborrower, obligor, or counterparty such that\nan obligation will not be repaid on time\nand/or in full or the client and/or\ncounterparty will fail to perform on an\nobligation to the Company or its affiliates.\nCredit risk exists in all activities where\nsuccess depends on the performance of a\nborrower, obligor, or counterparty. Credit\nrisk arises when Truist funds are extended,\ncommitted, invested, or otherwise exposed\nthrough actual or implied contractual\nagreements, whether on or off-balance sheet.\nCredit risk increases when the credit quality\nof an issuer whose securities or other\ninstruments the Company or its affiliates\nholds has deteriorated.\n\nTruist has established the following general\npractices to manage credit risk:\n\n\u2022 limiting the amount of credit that\nindividual lenders may extend to a borrower;\n\n\u2022 establishing a process for credit approval\naccountability;\n\n\u2022 careful initial underwriting and analysis of\nborrower, transaction, market, and collateral\nrisks;\n\n\u2022 ongoing servicing and monitoring of\nindividual loans and lending relationships;\n\n\u2022 maintaining collections and asset resolution\nteams;\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 continuous monitoring of the portfolio,\nconcentration and transactional limits,\nemerging risks, market dynamics and the\neconomy; and\n\n\u2022 periodically reevaluating the Company\u2019s\nstrategy and overall exposure as economic,\nmarket and other relevant conditions change.\n\nThe following discussion describes the\nunderwriting procedures and overall risk\nmanagement of Truist\u2019s lending function.\n\nUnderwriting Approach\n\nThe loan portfolio is a primary source of\nprofitability and risk; therefore, proper loan\nunderwriting is critical to Truist\u2019s long-term\nfinancial success. Truist\u2019s underwriting\napproach is designed to define acceptable\ncombinations of specific risk-mitigating\nfeatures that promote credit relationships\nthat conform to Truist\u2019s risk philosophy.\nProvided below is a summary of the most\nsignificant underwriting criteria used to\nevaluate new loans and loan renewals:\n\n\u2022 Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash\nflow adequacy is a necessary condition of\ncreditworthiness, meaning that loans must\neither be clearly supported by a borrower\u2019s\ncash flow or, if not, must be justified by\nsecondary repayment sources.\n\n\u2022 Secondary sources of repayment - alternative\nrepayment funds are a significant risk-\nmitigating factor as long as they are liquid,\ncan be easily accessed, and provide adequate\nresources to supplement the primary cash flow\nsource.\n\n\u2022 Value of any underlying collateral - loans\nare generally secured by the asset being\nfinanced. Because an analysis of the primary\nand secondary sources of repayment is the most\nimportant factor, collateral, unless it is\nliquid, does not justify loans that cannot be\nserviced by the borrower\u2019s normal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 Overall creditworthiness of the client,\ntaking into account the client\u2019s\nrelationships, both past and current, with\nTruist and other lenders - Truist\u2019s success\ndepends on building lasting and mutually\nbeneficial relationships with clients, which\ninvolves assessing their financial position\nand background.\n\n\u2022 Level of equity invested in the transaction\n- in general, borrowers are required to\ncontribute or invest a portion of their own\nfunds prior to any loan advances.\n\nRefer to the \u201cLending Activities\u201d section in\nMD&A for a discussion of each loan and lease\nportfolio.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risk                              \n                                              \nLiquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist\nwill be unable to meet its obligations as they\ncome due because of an inability to obtain\nadequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or\n(ii) Truist cannot easily monetize assets\nwithout significantly lowering market prices\nbecause of inadequate market depth or market\ndisruptions (market liquidity risk). Refer to\nthe \u201cLiquidity\u201d section in MD&A for additional\ndiscussion.\n                                              \n  Technology Risk                             \n                                              \nTechnology risk is the business risk\nassociated with the use, ownership, operation,\ninvolvement, influence, and adoption of\ninformation technology across the Company.\nTruist has defined and adopted a technology\nrisk framework that provides the foundation\nfor technology risk strategy, program, and\noversight and defines key objectives,\noperating model components, risk domains, and\ncapabilities to manage this risk.\n\nCybersecurity risk management and strategy\n\nLike other financial services firms, Truist\nfaces an increasingly complex and evolving\ncybersecurity threat environment. See Item 1A,\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d for information on risks from\ncybersecurity threats. We maintain a risk-\nbased cybersecurity framework that is part of\nour enterprise-wide risk management framework.\nIt is implemented through people, processes,\nand technology, whereby we assess, identify,\nand manage material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, and seek to continually adapt our\nrisk mitigation activities accordingly.\n\nOur cybersecurity framework is aligned with\nindustry standards such as those of the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\nand the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, and is designed to\nconform to the requirements and guidance from\napplicable regulatory authorities. In\naddition, our cybersecurity framework includes\ninternally and third-party focused\ncapabilities that drive the development and\nimplementation of our data security strategy,\nwhich is designed to reduce cybersecurity risk\nwhile enabling Truist\u2019s corporate business\nobjectives. Truist\u2019s cybersecurity strategy is\nenabled by Truist\u2019s multilayered defenses,\nincluding capabilities that are designed for\nearly and rapid cyber threat identification,\ndetection, protection, response, and recovery.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 75\nProcesses for assessing, identifying, and\nmanaging material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats\n\nAs part of our enterprise risk management\nframework, we have implemented and maintain a\nprogram to assess, identify, and manage risks\narising from the cybersecurity threats facing\nTruist. Truist maintains cybersecurity and\ninformation security policies, procedures, and\ntechnologies that are designed to address\nregulatory requirements and protect our\nclients\u2019, teammates\u2019 and our own data against\nunauthorized disclosure, modification, and\nmisuse. These policies, procedures, and\ntechnologies cover a broad range of areas,\nincluding: identification of internal and\nexternal threats, access control, data\nsecurity, protective controls, detection of\nmalicious or unauthorized activity, incident\nresponse, and recovery planning.\n\nTruist participates in the federally\nrecognized Financial Services Information\nSharing and Analysis Center as a key part of\nthe Company\u2019s cyber threat intelligence and\nresponse programs, as well as other industry\norganizations and initiatives that promote\nindustry best practices such as harmonized\ncybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and\nsecure consumer financial data sharing. To\nfurther mitigate the risks presented by an\nevolving cyber threat landscape, Truist\nprovides data protection guidance to clients\nand promotes data protection awareness and\naccountability through mandatory teammate\ntraining. Truist conducts scenario-driven test\nexercises simulating impacts and consequences\ndeveloped through analysis of real-world\ntechnology incidents as well as known and\nanticipated cyber threats. These exercises are\ndesigned to assess the viability of Truist\u2019s\ncrisis response and management programs and\nprovide the basis for continuous improvement.\nWhere a potential cybersecurity threat is\nidentified in our environment, our Cyber\nIncident Response Team evaluates the potential\nimpact to Truist and coordinates remediation\nwhere required. Our Cyber Incident Response\nTeam also manages significant cyber-specific\nevents, with escalation to executive\nmanagement and the Board, as appropriate.\n\nOur cybersecurity framework is also designed\nto help oversee, identify, and mitigate\ncybersecurity risks associated with our use of\nthird-party service providers. Following an\ninitial assessment of the level of enterprise\nrisk potentially posed by use of the third-\nparty, the service provider is then subject to\nfurther risk-based assessments on its\noperational resilience and cybersecurity\npractices, including disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity plans that specify the\ntime frame to resume activities and recover\ndata. In its agreements with third-party\nservice providers, Truist then requires\nservice providers to adhere to Truist\u2019s\nrelevant cybersecurity and operational\nresilience standards, subject to certain\nexceptions that are managed on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\nOur cybersecurity framework is routinely\nassessed to ensure the effectiveness of key\ncontrols through third-party cybersecurity\nmaturity measurements, technology risk\noversight, compliance risk management testing\nand monitoring, internal audit review, and\nregulatory oversight.\n\nIn addition, Truist continues to strengthen\nits cross-functional, holistic approach to\nenterprise resilience by addressing potential\namplification of risks from significant\ntechnology, cybersecurity and data incidents.\nAs part of these efforts, Truist is deepening\ncapabilities for both disaster recovery and\nrestoration, along with the implementation of\nother resilience measures.\n\nManagement\u2019s role in assessing and managing\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats\n\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity framework is operated\nand maintained by management, including the\nCIO, CISO, CRO and CTRO. These senior officers\nare responsible for assessing and managing\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity risks. Our\ncybersecurity framework strategy, which is\noverseen by CISO, is informed by various risk\nand control assessments, control testing,\nexternal assessments, threat intelligence, and\npublic and private information sharing. Our\ncybersecurity framework also includes\nprocesses for escalating and considering the\nmateriality of incidents that impact Truist,\nincluding escalation to executive management\nand the Board, which are periodically tested\nthrough tabletop exercises to test Truist\u2019s\npreparedness.\n\nIn addition, our Technology Management\nCommittee is an internal committee created to\nensure that members of executive management\noverseeing multiple business units understand\npertinent technology-related topics, including\ncybersecurity and information security, and\nassociated risks. The Technology Management\nCommittee provides additional oversight of\ncybersecurity and information security\nstrategy, including understanding and\nprioritizing cybersecurity and information\nsecurity capabilities and associated risks.\n\nThe members of management that lead our\nCybersecurity Program and strategy have\nextensive experience in technology,\ncybersecurity, and information security. Our\nCIO of has over 25 years of experience leading\ncybersecurity teams at financial institutions,\nincluding in the areas of information\ntechnology strategy, risk management, and\ninformation security. Following the departure\nof our CISO in January 2024, we have appointed\nan interim CISO while our search for a\npermanent CISO continues. Our interim CISO has\nover 20 years of experience as a technology\nand information security executive in the\nfinancial services industry, including serving\nas CISO at two different financial\ninstitutions and as a supervising examiner for\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nBoard of Directors\u2019 oversight of risks from\ncybersecurity threats\n\nOur Board has primary responsibility for the\noversight of our enterprise risk management,\nand exercises its oversight function in\nrespect of cybersecurity risk through two of\nits committees. The Risk Committee of the\nBoard is responsible for oversight of Truist\u2019s\nrisk management function, involving approving\nand reviewing Truist\u2019s risk management\nframework and policies as well as overseeing\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of Truist\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework and significant risk\npolicies. In addition, the Technology\nCommittee of the Board assists the Board and\nthe Risk Committee in oversight of Truist\u2019s\ntechnology risks.\n\nThe oversight responsibility of our Board and\nits committees is facilitated through\nmanagement-reporting processes designed to\nprovide visibility to the Board and its\ncommittees on the processes for the\nidentification, assessment, prioritization and\nmanagement of critical risks and management\u2019s\nrisk mitigation strategies. For example,\nmembers of the Risk Committee receive regular\nreports from our CRO and CTRO related to\ninformation technology and cybersecurity risks\nto Truist. The Risk Committee may also meet\nthroughout the year with risk management\nadvisors and discuss with executive management\nany recommendations received. In addition, the\nTechnology Committee receives reports from\nmanagement regarding Truist\u2019s practices,\nmanagement, and functioning of technology\noperations and cybersecurity and information\nsecurity risks, and reviews and discusses\nTruist\u2019s technology policies, standards and\ncontrols. On at least a semi-annual basis, the\nTechnology Committee reports to the Risk\nCommittee the significant activities\nundertaken by the Technology Committee\ninvolving oversight of technology risks in\nsupport of the Risk Committee\u2019s overall\nresponsibility and oversight of Truist\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework. The CISO provides\nupdates at every Technology Committee meeting\non cybersecurity and information security\nrisk, and the Board annually reviews and\napproves our Information Security Program and\nInformation Security Policy.\n\nTruist provides ongoing development and\neducation to its directors with respect to\ncybersecurity, including presentations at\nBoard meetings on special topics, such as\nupdates on cybersecurity legislation and\nregulation, as well as making available\nwritten materials and video presentations to\ndirectors for review at their own pace. The\nBoard also conducts a cybersecurity tabletop\nexercise at least every other year to simulate\nTruist\u2019s analysis and response to hypothetical\ncybersecurity incidents. In addition, Truist\nprovides directors with a Board Cybersecurity\nHandbook that provides details on key Truist\npractices, resources and protocols relating to\ncybersecurity protection, response and\npreparedness. Finally, as required by the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Board receives an\nupdate at least annually on Truist\u2019s\ninformation security program.\n\nData Risk\n\nTruist is subject to risk that data may be\nnegatively impacted by integrity, quality,\navailability, and privacy, which could\npotentially impact regulatory and management\nreporting, public disclosures, and business\ndecisions. Truist recognizes the importance of\nmaintaining accurate and reliable data and\nmaintains a formal data risk management\nprogram to mitigate risks related to data\nfidelity. Through active data risk monitoring\nand accuracy testing, Truist provides\nreasonable assurance over the quality and\nretention of key data used for operational,\nstrategic, regulatory, and compliance\npurposes. Management and the Board provide\noversight of the data risk management program\nand receive regular updates from the Chief\nData Risk Officer. While the current data risk\nmanagement program identifies and mitigates\ndata risk, the data risk program must be\ndynamic and is actively expanding oversight to\nenhance data risk management capabilities to\nachieve the data risk management objectives\ndefined in the strategic plan.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nCompliance risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nviolations of laws, rules, or regulations, or\nfrom non-conformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies, and procedures\nor ethical standards. This risk exposes Truist\nto fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of\ndamages, and the voiding of contracts.\nCompliance risk can result in diminished\nreputation, reduced franchise or enterprise\nvalue, limited business opportunities,\nincreased costs and expenses, and lessened\nexpansion potential.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risk                              \n                                              \nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings,\ncapital, stock price, diminished stakeholder\nconfidence, or negative impact to human\ncapital resulting from ineffective strategy\nand execution, adverse business decisions, or\nlack of responsiveness to changes in the\nbanking industry and operating environment.\nTruist is committed to fulfilling its overall\nstrategic objectives by setting and\nsuccessfully executing established business\nstrategies to deliver on earnings growth and\nmaintaining strong confidence and trust with\nkey stakeholder constituencies.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\n                                              \n  Reputational Risk                           \n                                              \nTruist manages reputational risk under an\nestablished risk management framework that\nincludes established policies and procedures\nembedded within its existing business and risk\nmanagement processes. The Company proactively\nmonitors, identifies, and internally escalates\npotential reputational risk events and\nendeavors to mitigate such reputational risks\nin a timely manner. Truist takes pride with\nensuring transparent and accurate\ncommunication, both internally and externally,\nto respond to key stakeholders on issues or\nevents that give rise to potential\nreputational risk. Truist utilizes an\nestablished risk taxonomy that is used to help\nidentify, measure, and monitor reputational\nrisk that enables clear transparently\ncommunication to stakeholders on the level of\npotential risk faced by the Company which in\nturn allows for effective management of risk\nto acceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to operating in a manner\nthat reflects the Company\u2019s stated Purpose,\nMission, and Values and seeks to protect its\nreputation, public confidence, and resilience\nby identifying and evaluating associated risks\nthat conflict with the expectations of the\nCompany\u2019s internal and external stakeholders,\nincluding clients, teammates, investors,\nregulators, and communities.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\ninadequate or failed internal processes,\npeople, and systems or from external events.\nIt includes legal risk, which is the risk of\nloss arising from defective transactions,\nlitigation or claims made, or the failure to\nadequately protect company-owned assets. An\noperational loss occurs when an event results\nin a loss or reserve originating from\noperational risk.\n\nModel Risk\n\nModel risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital from decisions\nbased on incorrect or misused model outputs.\nTruist uses models for many purposes,\nincluding the valuation of financial\npositions, estimation of credit losses, and\nthe measurement of risk. Valuation models are\nused to value certain financial instruments\nfor which quoted prices may not be readily\navailable. Valuation models are also used as\ninputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself,\nregulatory capital, stress testing, and the\nACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs,\nwho are responsible for the development,\nimplementation, and use of their models.\nOversight of these functions is performed by\nthe MRO, which is a component of the RMO. Once\nmodels have been approved, model owners are\nresponsible for the maintenance of an\nappropriate operating environment and must\nmonitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on a recurring basis. Models are\nupdated in response to changes in portfolio\ncomposition, industry and economic conditions,\ntechnological capabilities, and other\ndevelopments.\n\nMRO manages model risk in a holistic manner\nthrough a suite of model governance and model\nvalidation activities. The risk of each model\nis assessed and classified into various risk\ntiers. Additionally, MRO maintains an\nenterprise-wide model inventory containing\nrelevant model information. Regarding model\nvalidation, MRO utilizes internal validation\nanalysts and managers with skill sets in\npredictive modeling to perform detailed\nreviews of model development, implementation,\nand conceptual soundness. On certain\noccasions, the MRO will also engage external\nparties to assist with validation efforts.\nOnce in a production environment, MRO assesses\na model\u2019s performance on a periodic basis\nthrough ongoing monitoring reviews. MRO tracks\nissues that have been identified during model\nvalidation or through ongoing monitoring and\nengages with model owners to ensure their\ntimely remediation. MRO gauges model risk\nutilizing a collection of key risk indicators,\nwhich are periodically reported to relevant\ncommittees, including but not limited to, the\nModel Risk Management Committee and the ERC.\nMRO will also present model risk topics to the\nBoard Risk Committee as necessary.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $84.9 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 112% for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At December 31,\n2023, Truist was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity.

Truist additionally has the ability to\nincrease sources of funding by pledging\navailable investment securities to receive the\npar value of the collateral under the FRB Bank\nTerm Funding Program.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 79\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on and, from time-to-time, potential\nrepurchases or redemptions of a portion of an\noutstanding tranche of the long-term debt of\nthe Parent Company (as may be permitted by the\nterms of each respective series). See \u201cNote\n22. Parent Company Financial Information\u201d for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Parent Company had 48\nmonths and 37 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n30 months and 22 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for additional\ninformation regarding factors that influence\ncredit ratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings:\n\nThe following table presents the credit\nratings and outlooks of Truist and Truist Bank\nas of December 31, 2023:\n                                              \n  Tab\u2026                                        \n  36:                                         \n  Cre\u2026                                        \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Bank                                        \n          Moody\u2026    S&P      Fitch     DBRS   \n                                       Morn\u2026  \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A3        A- /     A+ /      AAL /  \n                    A-2      F1        R-1M   \n  Sen\u2026    A3        A-       A         AAL    \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Sub\u2026    A3        BBB+     A-        AH     \n  Pre\u2026    Baa2(\u2026    BBB-     BBB       AL     \n  sto\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Ban\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A2        A /      A+ /      AA /   \n                    A-1      F1        R-1H   \n  Sen\u2026    A2        A        A+        AA     \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Dep\u2026    Aa3 /     NA       AA- /     AA     \n          P-1                F1+              \n  Sub\u2026    (P) A2    A-       A         AAL    \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  out\u2026                                        \n  Cre\u2026    Negat\u2026    Stab\u2026    Negat\u2026    Stab\u2026  \n  tre\u2026                                        \n                                              \nChanges in the Company\u2019s credit ratings and\noutlooks during 2023 include:\n\n\u2022 On March 31, 2023, S&P Global Ratings\naffirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\nand revised the outlook on those ratings to\n\u201cstable\u201d from \u201cpositive,\u201d citing heightened\nmarket volatility in the wake of bank failures\nin the first half of 2023 and, with inflation\nstill elevated, higher uncertainty, and\ngreater downside risk in the economic outlook.\nThe change in outlook was part of a broader\naction by S&P Global Ratings whereby the\n\u201cpositive\u201d outlook on three other large U.S.\nbanks was revised to \u201cstable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 On August 7, 2023, Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nplaced the long-term ratings and certain\nshort-term ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\n\u201cunder review for downgrade,\u201d citing Truist\u2019s\ncomparatively low, though improving, level of\ncapitalization, along with weaknesses in\nasset-liability management. The review also\nreflects the view of Moody\u2019s Investor Service\nthat the stability of U.S. banks\u2019 deposit\nfunding has declined, as reflected in the\nagency\u2019s decision to lower the U.S. macro\nprofile.\n\n80 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 On August 11, 2023, DBRS, Inc. affirmed the\nratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nmaintained a \u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook, citing\nTruist\u2019s highly scaled and diversified\nregional banking franchise, conservative risk\nprofile, and sound liquidity management and\ncapital levels. In affirming the ratings,\nDBRS, Inc. also noted the ratings take into\naccount the more challenging operating\nenvironment and the expectation that funding\ncosts and asset quality metrics could worsen\nfrom current levels, providing some pressure\nto earnings, and that credit deterioration\nassociated with normalization of the credit\ncycle would be manageable.\n\n\u2022 On August 21, 2023, S&P Global Ratings\naffirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\nand maintained a \u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook,\nciting Truist\u2019s strong market position and\ndiversified business model as a substantial\noffset to deposit and margin pressures. S&P\nGlobal Ratings viewed Truist\u2019s capital ratios\nunfavorably after considering unrealized\nlosses on securities but also wrote that\nTruist has the earnings capacity to build its\ncapital ratios and support franchise growth\nover time.\n\n\u2022 On October 16, 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed\nthe ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nrevised the ratings outlook to \u201cnegative\u201d from\n\u201cstable.\u201d In affirming Truist\u2019s ratings, Fitch\nRatings cited the company\u2019s diverse revenue\nmodel, solid asset quality, and expected\ncapital build over the rating horizon;\nhowever, the \u201cnegative\u201d ratings outlook\nreflects the view of Fitch Ratings that Truist\ncurrently has less \u201cheadroom\u201d to face\nincreasing earnings pressures than similarly-\nrated peers.\n\n\u2022 On November 1, 2023, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService affirmed the ratings of Truist and\nTruist Bank and revised the outlook on those\nratings to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201crating under\nreview for downgrade.\u201d The confirmation of\nTruist\u2019s ratings reflects Moody\u2019s Investor\nService\u2019s view that Truist should be able to\ncontinue to grow its capital ratios through\nearnings retention and balance sheet\noptimization activities, and also maintain\nadequate control of its asset liability\nmanagement risks, including rising funding\ncosts and its sizeable holdings of low-\nyielding, fixed-rate assets.\n\n\u2022 On February 20, 2024, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService placed the long-term ratings and\ncertain short-term ratings of Truist and\nTruist Bank \u201cunder review for downgrade,\u201d\nciting that even though its capitalization\nwill improve materially, Truist will be less\ndiversified and will have greater reliance on\nnet interest income, and as a consequence of\nthese factors, it will likely have greater\nearnings volatility following the sale of TIH.\n\n\u2022 On February 20, 2024, Fitch Ratings\ndowngraded the ratings of Truist and Truist\nBank to \u2018A\u2019 from \u2018A+\u2019 following the announced\nsale of TIH. Fitch has also downgraded TFC and\nTruist Bank\u2019s viability rating to \u2018a\u2019 from\n\u2018a+.\u2019 The rating outlook is \u201cstable.\u201d Fitch\nRatings cited: (i) TIH as largest source of\nfee income; (ii) the segment has grown faster\nthan rest of the bank and benefited from\nhigher inflation in recent years; and (iii)\nthe sale will result in a less diverse\nbusiness mix than similarly-rated peers.\n\n\u2022 On February 20, 2024, DBRS, Inc. affirmed\nthe ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nmaintained a \u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook, citing\nthe sale of the remaining stake in TIH has no\nimpact on the Company\u2019s credit ratings.\n\n\u2022 On February 22, 2024, S&P Global Ratings\naffirmed its \u2018A-/A-2\u2019 issuer credit ratings on\nTruist and its \u2018A/A-1\u2019 ratings on Truist Bank,\nciting that the TIH sale will significantly\nboost Truist\u2019s regulatory capital ratios,\nenhance Truist\u2019s liquidity, and help fund\ncontinued organic growth in its core banking\nbusinesses. The outlook on the long-term\nratings is stable.\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are adequate to meet Truist\u2019s\ncurrent requirements and plans for continued\ngrowth. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\nhad $2.3 billion in obligations to purchase\ngoods or services that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Many of the purchase\nobligations have terms that are not fixed and\ndeterminable and are included in the total\namount of obligations based upon the estimated\ntiming and amount of payment. In addition,\ncertain of the purchase agreements contain\nclauses that would allow Truist to cancel the\nagreement with specified notice; however, that\nimpact is not included in determining the\ntotal amount of obligations.

Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 81\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital limits, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented internal stress\ncapital ratio minimums to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above internal minimums. Breaches of\ninternal stressed minimums prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist\u2019s capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026                                 \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.9%\napplicable to Truist as of December 31, 2023.\nTruist\u2019s SCB requirement, received in the 2023\nCCAR process, is effective from October 1,\n2023 to September 30, 2024.\n\nPayments of cash dividends and repurchases of\ncommon shares are the methods used to manage\nany excess capital generated. In addition,\nmanagement closely monitors the Parent\nCompany\u2019s double leverage ratio (investments\nin subsidiaries as a percentage of\nshareholders\u2019 equity). The active management\nof the subsidiaries\u2019 equity capital is the\nprocess used to manage this important driver\nof Parent Company liquidity and is a key\nelement in the management of Truist\u2019s capital\nposition.\n\nManagement intends to maintain capital at\nTruist Bank at levels that exceed the minimum\ncapital plus CCB. This will also result in\nTruist Bank being \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for\nregulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is\nmanagement\u2019s intent to maintain Truist Bank\u2019s\ncapital at levels that result in regulatory\nrisk-based capital ratios that are generally\ncomparable with peers of similar size,\ncomplexity, and risk profile. If the capital\nlevels of Truist Bank increase above these\nguidelines, excess capital may be transferred\nto the Parent Company in the form of special\ndividend payments, subject to regulatory and\nother operating considerations.\n\nManagement\u2019s capital deployment plan in order\nof preference is to focus on (i) organic\ngrowth, (ii) dividends, (iii) strategic\nopportunities and acquisitions, and (iv) share\nrepurchases if excess capital is available.\n\nTruist Bank\u2019s capital ratios are presented in\nthe following table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  38:                                         \n  Capital                                     \n  Ratios -                                    \n  Truist        Dec 31,         Dec 31,       \n  Bank             2023            2022       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CET1             11.7  %         10.6    %  \n  Tier 1           11.7            10.6       \n  capital                                     \n  Total            13.3            12.1       \n  capital                                     \n  Leverage          9.2             8.5       \n  ratio                                       \n  Supplem\u2026                                    \n  leverage          7.9                  7.3  \n  ratio                                       \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s capital ratios are presented in the\nfollowing table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  39:                                         \n  Capital                                     \n  Ratios                                      \n  -                                           \n  Truist                                      \n  Financ\u2026                                     \n  Corpor\u2026                                     \n  (Dolla\u2026                                     \n  in             Dec 31,          Dec 31,     \n  millio\u2026           2023             2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk-b\u2026                                     \n  CET1              10.1  %           9.0  %  \n  Tier 1            11.6             10.5     \n  capital                                     \n  Total             13.7             12.4     \n  capital                                     \n  Levera\u2026            9.3              8.5     \n  ratio                                       \n  Supple\u2026                                     \n  levera\u2026            7.9              7.3     \n  ratio                                       \n  Risk-w\u2026    $   423,705       $  434,413     \n  assets                                      \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s capital level at December 31, 2023\nremains strong compared to the regulatory\nlevels for well-capitalized banks. Truist\u2019s\nCET1 ratio was 10.1% as of December 31, 2023.\nThe 110 basis point increase since December\n31, 2022 resulted from organic capital\ngeneration and the minority stake sale in TIH,\npartially offset by the CECL phase in. The\nremaining CECL phase in will be amortized\nratably in the first quarters of 2024 and\n2025.\n\nTruist paid $2.8 billion in common stock\ndividends, or $2.08 per share, during 2023,\ncompared to $2.7 billion, or $2.00 per share,\nfor 2022. Truist did not have any share\nrepurchases for 2023 and repurchased $250\nmillion in common stock in 2022. In early\n2024, Truist declared common dividends of\n$0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2024.\n\n82 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Reclassifications                           \n                                              \nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications\nhave been made to prior period information to\nconform to the current presentation. Such\nreclassifications had no effect on previously\nreported shareholders\u2019 equity or net income.\nRefer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d for\nadditional discussion regarding\nreclassifications.\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \nThe accounting and reporting policies of\nTruist are in accordance with GAAP and conform\nto the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The\nfinancial position and results of operations\nare affected by management\u2019s application of\naccounting policies, including estimates,\nassumptions and judgments made to arrive at\nthe carrying value of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported for revenues and\nexpenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations and related disclosures.\nUnderstanding Truist\u2019s accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. Accordingly, Truist\u2019s significant\naccounting policies and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\ndetail in \u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation.\u201d\n\nThe following is a summary of Truist\u2019s\ncritical accounting policies that are highly\ndependent on estimates, assumptions, and\njudgments. These critical accounting policies\nare reviewed with the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors on a periodic basis.\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s ACL represents management\u2019s best\nestimate of expected future credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolios and\noff-balance sheet lending commitments at the\nbalance sheet date. Estimates of expected\nfuture loan and lease losses are determined by\nusing statistical models and management\u2019s\njudgement. The ACL estimation process includes\nboth quantitatively calculated components as\nwell as qualitative components. Quantitative\nmodels are designed to forecast probability of\ndefault, exposure at default and loss given\ndefault by correlating certain macroeconomic\nforecast data to historical experience. The\nmodels are generally applied at the portfolio\nlevel to pools of loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. Certain loans or leases that\ndo not have similar risk characteristics are\nindividually evaluated when establishing an\nallowance for expected credit losses. The\nmacroeconomic forecast data used in the models\nis based on forecasted variables for the\nreasonable and supportable period of two\nyears. Beyond this forecast period the models\ngradually revert to long-term historical loss\nconditions over a one-year period. As a means\nof addressing uncertainty related to future\neconomic conditions, the quantitative\nallowance components include an adjustment\nthat reflects model outputs calculated using a\nrange of potential future economic conditions.\nExpected losses are estimated through\ncontractual maturity, giving appropriate\nconsideration to expected prepayments unless\nthe borrower has a right to renew that is not\ncancellable or to capture the losses expected\nat the balance sheet date or prior to January\n1, 2023 it is reasonably expected that the\nloan will be modified as a TDR.\n\nThe qualitative components of the ACL\nincorporate management\u2019s judgment in\ndetermining qualitative adjustments where\nmodel outputs are inconsistent with\nmanagement\u2019s expectations with respect to\nexpected credit losses. The qualitative\ncomponents are used to adjust for limitations\nin modeled results related to current economic\nconditions, and considerations with respect to\nthe impact of current and expected events or\nrisks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and\nmay not be completely considered by\nquantitative models.\n\nManagement considers a range of macroeconomic\nforecast data in connection with the allowance\nestimation process. Under the range of\nscenarios considered as of December 31, 2023,\nuse of the Company\u2019s pessimistic scenario\nwould have resulted in an increase to the\nmodeled allowance results of approximately\n$2.2 billion. This estimate reflects the\nsensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate\nto macroeconomic forecast data but does not\nconsider other qualitative adjustments that\ncould increase or decrease modeled loss\nestimates calculated using this alternative\neconomic scenario.\n\nThe Company individually evaluates expected\ncredits losses related to loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nand prior to January 1, 2023 loans that have\nbeen classified as a TDR. For individually\nevaluated loans, the ALLL is determined\nthrough review of data specific to the\nborrower and related collateral, if any, while\nprior to January 1, 2023 for TDRs, default\nexpectations and estimated prepayment speeds\nthat are specific to each of the restructured\nloan populations are incorporated in the\ndetermination of the ALLL.\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is similar to that used to\ndetermine the funded component of the ALLL and\nis measured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default. A detailed\ndiscussion of the methodology used in\ndetermining the ACL is included in \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation.\u201d\n               Truist Financial Corporation 83\n                                              \n  Fair Value of Financial Instruments         \n                                              \nThe vast majority of assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis\nare based on either quoted market prices or\nmarket prices for similar instruments. Refer\nto \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures\u201d for\nadditional disclosures regarding the fair\nvalue of financial instruments and \u201cNote 2.\nBusiness Combinations, Divestitures, and\nNoncontrolling Interests\u201d for additional\ndisclosures regarding business combinations.\n\nSecurities\n\nTruist generally utilizes a third-party\npricing service in determining the fair value\nof its AFS investment securities, whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. Fair\nvalue measurements for investment securities\nare derived from market-based pricing matrices\nthat were developed using observable inputs\nthat include benchmark yields, benchmark\nsecurities, reported trades, offers, bids,\nissuer spreads, and broker quotes. Management\nperforms procedures to evaluate the fair\nvalues provided by the third-party service\nprovider. These procedures, which are\nperformed independent of the responsible\nbusiness unit, include comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service to other third-party pricing\nsources, review of additional information\nprovided by the third-party pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on security sales to the daily\npricing information received from the third-\nparty pricing service. The Enterprise\nValuation Committee, which provides oversight\nto Truist\u2019s enterprise-wide IPV function, is\nresponsible for the comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service or internally to other third-\nparty pricing sources, approving tolerance\nlimits determined by IPV for price comparison\nexceptions, reviewing significant changes to\npricing and valuation policies and reviewing\nand approving the pricing decisions made on\nany illiquid and hard-to-price securities.\nWhen market observable data is not available,\nwhich generally occurs due to the lack of\nliquidity or inactive markets for certain\nsecurities, the valuation of the security is\nsubjective and may involve substantial\njudgment by management to reflect unobservable\ninput assumptions.\n\nMSRs\n\nTruist\u2019s primary class of MSRs for which it\nseparately manages the economic risks relates\nto residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do\nnot trade in an active, open market with\nreadily observable prices. While sales of MSRs\ndo occur, the precise terms and conditions\ntypically are not readily available.\nAccordingly, Truist estimates the fair value\nof residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS\nvaluation model to project residential MSR\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios, which are then discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The OAS model considers\nportfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment\nassumptions, delinquency rates, late charges,\nother ancillary revenue, costs to service and\nother economic factors. Truist reassesses and\nperiodically adjusts the underlying inputs and\nassumptions in the OAS model to reflect market\nconditions and assumptions that a market\nparticipant would consider in valuing the\nresidential MSR asset.\n\nFair value estimates and assumptions are\ncompared to industry surveys, recent market\nactivity, actual portfolio experience and,\nwhen available, observable market data. Due to\nthe nature of the valuation inputs,\nresidential MSRs are classified within Level 3\nof the valuation hierarchy. The value of\nresidential MSRs is significantly affected by\nmortgage interest rates available in the\nmarketplace, which influence mortgage loan\nprepayment speeds. In general, during periods\nof declining interest rates, the value of MSRs\ndeclines due to increasing prepayments\nattributable to increased mortgage-refinance\nactivity. Conversely, during periods of rising\ninterest rates, the value of residential MSRs\ngenerally increases due to reduced refinance\nactivity. Truist typically hedges against\nmarket value changes in the residential MSRs.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nquantitative disclosures reflecting the effect\nthat changes in management\u2019s assumptions would\nhave on the fair value of residential MSRs.\n\nLHFS\n\nTruist originates certain residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans for sale to\ninvestors that are measured at fair value. The\nfair value is primarily based on quoted market\nprices for securities backed by similar types\nof loans. Changes in the fair value are\nrecorded as components of Mortgage banking\nincome, while the related origination costs\nare generally recognized in Personnel expense\nwhen incurred. The changes in fair value are\nlargely driven by changes in interest rates\nsubsequent to loan funding and changes in the\nfair value of servicing associated with the\nLHFS. Truist uses various derivative\ninstruments to mitigate the economic effect of\nchanges in fair value of the underlying loans.\nLHFS also includes certain loans, generally\ncarried at LOCOM, where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nAdjustments to reflect unrealized gains and\nlosses resulting from changes in fair value,\nup to the original carrying amount, and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nare classified as noninterest income. The fair\nvalue of these loans is estimated using\nobservable market prices when available. When\nobservable market prices are not available,\nthe Company uses judgment and estimates fair\nvalue using internal models that reflect\nassumptions consistent with those that would\nbe used by a market participant in estimating\nfair value. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for further description of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting for LHFS.\n\n84 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTrading Loans\n\nTruist elects to measure certain loans at fair\nvalue for financial reporting where fair value\naligns with the underlying business purpose.\nSpecifically, loans included within this\nclassification include trading loans that are\n(i) purchased in connection with the Company\u2019s\nTRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and\ntrading business within the C&CB segment, or\n(iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to \u201cNote 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d and \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\u201d for further\ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s TRS business. The\nloans purchased in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS and sales and trading businesses\nare primarily commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans valued based on quoted prices\nfor identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active by a third-party\npricing service. SBA loans are fully\nguaranteed by the U.S. government as to\ncontractual principal and interest and there\nis sufficient observable trading activity upon\nwhich to base the estimate of fair value.\n\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nTruist uses derivatives to manage various\nfinancial risks and in a dealer capacity to\nfacilitate client transactions. Truist\nmitigates credit risk by subjecting\ncounterparties to credit reviews and approvals\nsimilar to those used in making loans and\nother extensions of credit. In addition,\ncertain counterparties are required to provide\ncollateral to Truist when their unsecured loss\npositions exceed certain negotiated limits.\nThe fair values of derivative financial\ninstruments are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable data for interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments, which\nare related to mortgage loan commitments, is\nbased on quoted market prices adjusted for\ncommitments that Truist does not expect to\nfund and includes the value attributable to\nthe net servicing fee. Refer to \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d for further\ninformation on the Company\u2019s derivatives.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nThe acquisition method of accounting requires\nthat assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin business combinations are recorded at their\nfair values. This often involves estimates\nbased on third-party valuations or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow\nanalyses or other valuation techniques, which\nare inherently subjective. The amortization of\ndefinite-lived intangible assets is based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits to be\nreceived, which is also subjective. Business\ncombinations also typically result in\ngoodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic\nimpairment tests based on the fair values of\nthe reporting units to which the acquired\ngoodwill relates. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for a description of the\nimpairment testing process.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Truist\u2019s reporting units\nwith goodwill balances were CB&W, C&CB, and\nIH. Management performs a goodwill impairment\nanalysis on an annual basis as of October 1 or\nmore often if events or circumstances indicate\nthat it is more-likely-than not that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is below its\ncarrying value. For its annual impairment\nreview, Truist performed a quantitative test\nof each of its reporting units. The\nquantitative impairment test estimates the\nfair value of the reporting units using the\nincome approach and a market-based approach,\nweighted 50% and 50%, respectively. The inputs\nand assumptions specific to each reporting\nunit are incorporated in the valuations,\nincluding projections of future cash flows,\ndiscount rates, and applicable valuation\nmultiples based on the comparable public\ncompany information. The income approach\nutilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of\nmulti-year financial forecasts developed for\neach reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions such as net interest\nmargin, expected credit losses, noninterest\nincome, noninterest expense, and required\ncapital. The market based approach utilizes\ncomparable public company information, key\nvaluation multiples, and considers a market\ncontrol premium associated with cost synergies\nand other cash flow benefits that arise from\nobtaining control over a reporting unit, and\nguideline transactions, when applicable.\n\nTruist also assesses the reasonableness of the\naggregate estimated fair value of the\nreporting units by comparison to its market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime, including consideration of expected\nacquirer expense synergies, historic bank\ncontrol premiums, and the current market.\n\nThe projection of net interest margin and\nnoninterest expense are the most significant\ninputs to the financial projections of the\nCB&W and C&CB reporting units. The long-term\ngrowth rate used in determining the terminal\nvalue of each reporting unit was 3% as of\nOctober 1, 2023, based on management\u2019s\nassessment of the minimum expected terminal\ngrowth rate of each reporting unit. Discount\nrates are estimated based on the Capital Asset\nPricing Model, which considers the risk-free\ninterest rate, market risk premium, beta, and\nunsystematic risk adjustments specific to a\nparticular reporting unit. The discount rates\nare also calibrated based on risks related to\nthe projected cash flows of each reporting\nunit. The discount rates utilized for the\nCB&W, C&CB, and IH reporting units as of\nOctober 1, 2023 were 13.5%, 12.5%, and 11.0%,\nrespectively.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 85\nBased on the Company\u2019s annual impairment test\nof goodwill, it was determined for the CB&W\nand C&CB reporting units that the respective\nreporting units\u2019 carrying value was in excess\nof its respective fair value as of October 1,\n2023, resulting in a non-cash, non-tax-\ndeductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.1\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe goodwill impairment was primarily due to\nthe continued impact of higher interest rates\nand discount rates on the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units, and a sustained decline in\nbanking industry share prices, including\nTruist\u2019s. For the IH reporting unit, it was\ndetermined that the reporting unit\u2019s fair\nvalue was in excess of its respective carrying\nvalue as of October 1, 2023.\n\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value.\nCircumstances that could negatively impact the\nfair value of Truist\u2019s reporting units in the\nfuture include a sustained decrease in\nTruist\u2019s stock price, continued decline in\nindustry peer multiples, an increase in the\napplicable discount rate and further\ndeterioration in the reporting units\u2019\nforecasts. Additionally, a reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value could change based on market\nconditions, change in the underlying makeup of\nthe reporting unit, or the risk profile of\nthose reporting units, which could impact\nwhether the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from October 1, 2023 through\nDecember 31, 2023, including macroeconomic and\nmarket factors, industry and banking sector\nevents, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nOctober 1, 2023 quantitative impairment test,\nand the sensitivity of the October 1, 2023\nquantitative test results to changes in\nassumptions through December 31, 2023. Based\non these considerations, management concluded\nthat it was not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of one or more of its reporting\nunits is below its respective carrying amount\nas of December 31, 2023.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to income tax laws of the\nU.S., its states, and the municipalities in\nwhich the Company conducts business. In\nestimating the net amount due to or to be\nreceived from tax jurisdictions either\ncurrently or in the future, the Company\nassesses the appropriate tax treatment of\ntransactions and filing positions after\nconsidering statutes, regulations, judicial\nprecedent, and other pertinent information.\nThe income tax laws are complex and subject to\ndifferent interpretations by the taxpayer and\nthe relevant government taxing authorities.\nSignificant judgment is required in\ndetermining the tax accruals and in evaluating\nthe Company\u2019s tax positions, including\nevaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in\nthe estimate of accrued taxes occur\nperiodically due to changes in tax rates,\ninterpretations of tax laws and new judicial\nguidance, the status of examinations by the\ntax authorities, and newly enacted statutory\nand regulatory guidance that could impact the\nrelative merits and risks of tax positions.\nThese changes, when they occur, impact tax\nexpense and can materially affect operating\nresults. Truist reviews tax positions\nquarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new\ninformation becomes available.\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts\navailable to reduce income taxes payable in\nfuture years. Such assets arise due to\ntemporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities, as well as from NOL and tax\ncredit carryforwards. The Company regularly\nevaluates the ability to realize DTAs,\nrecognizing a valuation allowance if, based on\nthe weight of available evidence, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe DTA will not be realized. In determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is necessary,\nthe Company considers the level of taxable\nincome in prior years to the extent that\ncarrybacks are permitted under current tax\nlaws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax\nand taxable income and tax planning strategies\nthat would, if necessary, be implemented.\nTruist currently maintains a valuation\nallowance for certain state carryforwards. For\nadditional income tax information, refer to\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d and \u201cNote 14.\nIncome Taxes.\u201d\n                                              \n  Pension and Postretirement Benefit          \n  Obligations                                 \n                                              \nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions,\nwhich are subject to management judgment and\nmay differ significantly if different\nassumptions are used. The discount rate\nassumption used to measure the postretirement\nbenefit obligations is set by reference to an\nAA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and\nthe individual characteristics of the plans\nsuch as projected cash flow patterns and\npayment durations.\n\nManagement also considered the sensitivity\nthat changes in the expected return on plan\nassets and the discount rate would have on\npension expense. For the Company\u2019s qualified\nplans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the\ndiscount rate would result in additional\npension expense of approximately $29 million\nfor 2024, while a decrease of 100 basis points\nin the expected return on plan assets would\nresult in an increase of approximately $145\nmillion in pension expense for 2024. This\nestimate reflects the sensitivity of certain\nfactors considered in calculation of pension\nexpense but does not consider all factors that\ncould increase or decrease estimates\ncalculated.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 15.

We also have audited the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2023 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCOSO.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinions                          \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for\nthese consolidated financial statements, for\nmaintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 87\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matters communicated below\nare matters arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Certain\nCommercial, Consumer, and Credit Card\nPortfolios\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit losses (ACL)\nrepresents management\u2019s best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated ACL balance was\n$5.1 billion as of December 31, 2023,\nincluding $2.2 billion for commercial\nportfolios, $2.2 billion for consumer\nportfolios, and $0.4 billion for credit card.\nAs disclosed by management, estimates of\nexpected future loan and lease losses are\ndetermined by using statistical models and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. The ACL estimation\nprocess includes both quantitatively\ncalculated components as well as qualitative\ncomponents. Quantitative models are designed\nto forecast probability of default, exposure\nat default, and loss given default by\ncorrelating certain macroeconomic forecast\ndata to historical experience. The models are\ngenerally applied to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic forecast data used in the\nquantitative models is based on forecasted\nvariables for a reasonable and supportable\nperiod. The qualitative components of the ACL\nincorporate management\u2019s judgment in\ndetermining qualitative adjustments where\nmodel outputs are inconsistent with\nmanagement\u2019s expectations with respect to\nexpected credit losses. The qualitative\ncomponents are used to adjust for limitations\nin modeled results related to current economic\nconditions, and considerations with respect to\nthe impact of current and expected events or\nrisks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and\nmay not be completely considered by\nquantitative models.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the ACL for certain commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment by management in determining the\nquantitative model results and certain\nqualitative adjustments; (ii) a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating audit\nevidence related to the quantitative model\nresults and certain qualitative adjustments;\nand (iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the Company\u2019s ACL\nestimation process for certain commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios, which\nincluded controls related to the quantitative\nmodel results and certain qualitative\nadjustments. These procedures also included,\namong others, testing management\u2019s process for\ndetermining the ACL for certain commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios\nquantitative model results and certain\nqualitative adjustments, which included\nevaluating the appropriateness of the\nquantitative models and management\u2019s\nmethodology, testing the completeness and\naccuracy of the underlying data used in\ndetermining the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, and\nevaluating the reasonableness of judgments\nused by management in determining certain\nqualitative adjustments. Professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge were used to\nassist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness\nof the quantitative models and (ii) the\nreasonableness of judgments used by management\nin determining certain qualitative\nadjustments.\n\nGoodwill Impairment Analyses \u2013 CB&W and C&CB\nReporting Units\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated goodwill balance was\n$20.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. The\ngoodwill associated with the Consumer Banking\nand Wealth (CB&W) and Corporate and Commercial\nBanking (C&CB) reporting units was $13.5\nbillion and $3.7 billion, respectively. As\ndisclosed by management, management performs a\ngoodwill impairment analysis on an annual\nbasis as of October 1 or more often if events\nor circumstances indicate that is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying value. The\nquantitative impairment test estimates the\nfair value of the reporting units using the\nincome approach and a market based approach.\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates, and applicable\nvaluation multiples based on the comparable\npublic company information. The income\napproach utilizes a discounted cash flow\nanalysis of multi-year financial forecasts\ndeveloped for each reporting unit considering\nseveral inputs and assumptions such as net\ninterest margin, expected credit losses,\nnoninterest income, noninterest expense and\nrequired capital. The market based approach\nutilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples, and\nconsiders a market control premium associated\nwith cost synergies and other cash flow\nbenefits that arise from obtaining control\nover a reporting unit, and guideline\ntransactions, when applicable.\n\n88 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the goodwill impairment analyses\nof the CB&W and C&CB reporting units is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment by management when determining the\nfair value estimate of the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units using the income approach and\nmarket based approach; (ii) a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating\nmanagement\u2019s significant assumptions related\nto net interest margin, noninterest expense,\nand the discount rates used in the income\napproach and the key valuation multiples and\nmarket control premiums used in the market\nbased approach; and (iii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to management\u2019s goodwill\nimpairment analyses, which included controls\nrelated to the valuation of the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management\u2019s\nprocess for determining the fair value\nestimate of the CB&W and C&CB reporting units,\nwhich included evaluating the appropriateness\nof management\u2019s income approach and market\nbased approach, testing the completeness and\naccuracy of the underlying data used in the\nincome approach and market based approach, and\nevaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s\nsignificant assumptions related to net\ninterest margin, noninterest expense, and the\ndiscount rates used in the income approach and\nthe key valuation multiples and market control\npremiums used in the market based approach.\nEvaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to\nnet interest margin and noninterest expense\ninvolved evaluating whether the assumptions\nwere reasonable considering (i) the current\nand past performance of the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units and (ii) the consistency with\nexternal data. Professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge were used to assist in\nevaluating (i) the appropriateness of the\nincome approach and the market based approach\nand (ii) the reasonableness of the net\ninterest margin and discount rate assumptions\nused in the income approach and the key\nvaluation multiples and market control premium\nassumptions used in the market based approach.\n\n/s/

                                 \n  NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nTruist Financial Corporation is a purpose-\ndriven financial services company committed to\ninspiring and building better lives and\ncommunities. As a leading U.S. commercial\nbank, Truist has leading market share in many\nof the high-growth markets across the country.\nTruist offers a wide range of products and\nservices through our wholesale and consumer\nbusinesses, including consumer and small\nbusiness banking, commercial banking,\ncorporate and investment banking, insurance,\nwealth management, payments, and specialized\nlending businesses. Headquartered in\nCharlotte, North Carolina, Truist is a top-10\ncommercial bank. In 2023, the Company operated\nand measured business activity across three\nbusiness segments: Consumer Banking and\nWealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and\nInsurance Holdings. These segments are being\nrealigned in the first quarter of 2024. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nbusiness segments and their realignment, see\n\u201cNote 21. Operating Segments.\u201d\n\nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. The accounting and reporting policies\nare in accordance with GAAP and conform to the\nguidelines prescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The following is a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Truist Financial Corporation\nand those subsidiaries that are wholly or\nmajority owned by Truist or over which Truist\nhas a controlling financial interest.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are\neliminated in consolidation. The results of\noperations of companies and net assets\nacquired are included from the date of\nacquisition. Results of operations associated\nwith entities or net assets sold are included\nthrough the date of disposition.\nTruist holds investments in certain legal\nentities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are\nlegal entities in which equity investors do\nnot have sufficient equity at risk for the\nentity to independently finance its\nactivities, or as a group, the holders of the\nequity investment at risk lack the power\nthrough voting or similar rights to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nor do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the entity or the right to\nreceive expected residual returns of the\nentity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if\na reporting entity is the primary beneficiary\nof the VIE.\nInvestments in VIEs are evaluated to determine\nif Truist is the primary beneficiary. This\nevaluation gives appropriate consideration to\nthe design of the entity and the variability\nthat the entity was designed to create and\npass along, the relative power of each party,\nand to Truist\u2019s obligation to absorb losses or\nreceive residual returns of the entity. For\nchanges in facts and circumstances, Truist re-\nassesses whether or not it is a primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE. Truist has variable\ninterests in certain entities that are not\nrequired to be consolidated. Refer to \u201cNote\n16. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d for\nadditional disclosures regarding Truist\u2019s\nVIEs.\nInvestments in entities for which the Company\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not control, over operating and\nfinancing decisions are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in Other assets in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost,\nadjusted to reflect the Company\u2019s portion of\nincome, loss, or dividends of the investee.\nTruist records its portion of income or loss\nin Other noninterest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. These\ninvestments are periodically evaluated for\nimpairment.\nThe Company reports any noncontrolling\ninterests in its subsidiaries in the equity\nsection of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nseparately presents the income or loss\nattributable to the noncontrolling interest of\na consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nReclassifications\nIn 2023, Truist reclassified certain\nportfolios within the consumer portfolio\nsegment to delineate home equity from other\nconsumer portfolios. Additionally, Truist\nrealigned Prime Rate Premium Finance\nCorporation, which includes AFCO Credit\nCorporation and CAFO Holding Company, into the\nC&CB segment from the IH segment. Prior period\nresults have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent presentation.\nIn 2023, Truist updated its segment cost\nallocation methodology. Results for 2023 have\nbeen revised to conform to the current\npresentation. Management concluded the impact\nto 2022 was not material.\nCertain other amounts reported in prior\nperiods\u2019 consolidated financial statements\nhave been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent presentation.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 95\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nBusiness Combinations\nTruist accounts for business combinations\nusing the acquisition method. The accounts of\nan acquired entity are included as of the date\nof acquisition, and any excess of purchase\nprice over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is recorded as goodwill.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due\nfrom banks and interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks that have original maturities of three\nmonths or less. Accordingly, the carrying\namount of such instruments is considered a\nreasonable estimate of fair value. Restricted\ncash was immaterial at December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nSecurities Financing Activities\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell are accounted for as\ncollateralized financing transactions and are\nrecorded at the amounts at which the\nsecurities were borrowed or purchased. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and related counterparty agree on the\namount of collateral required to secure the\nprincipal amount loaned under these\nagreements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements.\nShort-term borrowings include securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, which are\naccounted for as collateralized financing\ntransactions and are recorded at the amounts\nat which the securities were sold. The Company\nmonitors collateral values daily and pledges\ncollateral as warranted under the respective\nagreements.\nTrading Activities\nVarious trading assets and liabilities are\nused to accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of the Company\u2019s\nclients. Product offerings to clients include\ndebt securities, loans traded in the secondary\nmarket, equity securities, derivative\ncontracts, and other similar financial\ninstruments. The Company elects to apply fair\nvalue accounting to trading loans. Trading\nloans include: (i) loans held in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans\nguaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii)\nloans made or acquired in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS business. Other trading-related\nactivities include acting as a market maker\nfor certain debt and equity security\ntransactions, derivative instrument\ntransactions, and foreign exchange\ntransactions. Trading assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recognized within Noninterest\nincome in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Interest income on\ntrading account securities is included in\nInterest on other earning assets. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\ntrading activities, see \u201cNote 16. Commitments\nand Contingencies\u201d and \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance.\nInvestments in debt securities that are not\nheld for trading purposes are classified as\nHTM or AFS.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nDebt securities are classified as HTM when\nTruist has both the intent and ability to hold\nthe securities to maturity. HTM securities are\nreported at amortized cost. AFS securities are\nreported at estimated fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI,\nnet of deferred income taxes, in the\nShareholders\u2019 equity section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses\nrealized from the sale of AFS securities are\ndetermined by specific identification and are\nincluded in noninterest income.\n96 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit related losses are measured on\nan individual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, are highly rated by rating\nagencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. Non-agency MBS in the portfolio\nreflect recent issuances that are highly\nrated, include excess collateral and are\ncollateralized by loans to borrowers with high\ncredit scores and low loan to value ratios.\nTruist utilizes cash flow modeling for the\nevaluation of potential credit impairment on\nnon-agency securities in an unrealized loss\nposition. Cash flow modeling incorporates a\nvariety of factors that impact the long-term\nexpectation of collateral performance.\nImpairment is attributable to factors other\nthan credit when there continues to be an\nexpectation of the collection of all\ncontractual principal and interest.\n\nRelated to any unrealized losses reported in\nAOCI, Truist considers any intent to sell and\nwhether it was more-likely-than-not that the\nCompany would be required to sell those\nsecurities before the anticipated recovery of\nthe amortized cost basis as of the reporting\ndate.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities that are not classified as\ntrading assets or liabilities are recorded in\nOther assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered\nmarketable and measured at fair value, with\nchanges in the fair value recognized as a\ncomponent of Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMarketable equity securities include mutual\nfund investments and other publicly traded\nequity securities. Dividends received from\nmarketable equity securities and FHLB stock\nare recognized within Interest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity\nsecurities that are not accounted for under\nthe equity method and that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered non-\nmarketable and are accounted for at cost minus\nimpairment, if any, plus or minus changes\nresulting from observable price changes in\norderly transactions for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same issuer. Any\nadjustments to the carrying value of these\nnon-marketable equity securities are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNon-marketable equity securities include FHLB\nstock and other equity investments. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities, see \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nLHFS\nLHFS includes primarily residential mortgage\nand commercial mortgage loans that management\nintends to sell in the secondary market and\nother loans that management has an active plan\nto sell. LHFS also includes specifically\nidentified loans where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nThe Company elects to apply fair value\naccounting to residential and commercial\nmortgage loans that are originated with the\nintent to be sold in the secondary market.\nDirect loan origination fees associated with\nthese loans are recorded as Mortgage banking\nincome. The majority of direct origination\ncosts are recorded in Personnel expense. The\nfair value of these loans is derived from\nobservable current market prices when\navailable and includes loan servicing value.\nWhen observable market prices are not\navailable, the Company uses judgment and\nestimates fair value using internal models\nthat reflect assumptions consistent with those\nthat would be used by a market participant in\nestimating fair value.\nFirst lien residential mortgage LHFS are\ntransferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE\nsecuritization transactions, whereby the loans\nare exchanged for cash or securities that are\nreadily redeemable for cash with servicing\nrights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale\nof residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at\ninception of the associated interest rate lock\ncommitments and reflect the change in value of\nthe loans resulting from changes in interest\nrates from the time the Company enters into\ninterest rate lock commitments with borrowers\nuntil the loans are sold, adjusted for pull\nthrough rates and excluding hedge transactions\ninitiated to mitigate this market risk.\nCommercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and\nFHLMC and the Company also issues and sells\nGNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured\nloans. The loans and securities are exchanged\nfor cash with servicing rights retained. Gains\nand losses on sales of residential and\ncommercial mortgages are included in Mortgage\nbanking income and gains and losses on sales\nof other consumer loans are included in Other\nincome.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may\ntransfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At\nthe time of transfer, the loans are recorded\nat LOCOM and charge-offs are recorded as\nnecessary at the transfer date. Subsequent to\nthe initial transfer to LHFS these assets are\nrevalued at each subsequent reporting date,\nand any resulting adjustments are reported as\nchanges to a valuation allowance, which is\nrecorded as a component of Noninterest income\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s LHFS,\nsee \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures.\u201d\n               Truist Financial Corporation 97\nSpecifically identified LHFS, where management\nhas committed to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale, are\nrecorded at LOCOM. Origination fees and costs\nfor such loans are capitalized in the basis of\nthe loan and are included in the calculation\nof realized gains and losses upon sale.\nAdjustments to reflect unrealized losses\nresulting from changes in fair value and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nof the loans are classified as Noninterest\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The fair value of these loans is\nestimated using observable market prices when\navailable, but may also incorporate\nconsideration of other unobservable inputs\nsuch as indicative bids, broker price opinions\nor other information derived from internal or\nexternal data sources.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company\u2019s accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased, and if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that at the date of acquisition there is\nmore than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\nUnearned income, discounts, and net deferred\nloan fees and costs include direct costs\nassociated with loan origination as well as\npremiums and discounts from origination or\npurchase, which are deferred and amortized\nover the respective loan terms.\nOriginated Loans and Leases\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture or until maturity or payoff are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing loans\nor straight-line method for loans with\ninterest-only repayment terms or revolving\nprivileges.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date. Purchased loans\nare evaluated upon acquisition and classified\nas either PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality, including but not limited to risk\ngrades, delinquency, nonperforming status,\nprevious reportable loan modifications,\nbankruptcies, and other qualitative factors\nthat indicate deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination.\nFair values for purchased loans in a business\ncombination are based on a discounted cash\nflow methodology that considers credit loss\nexpectations, market interest, rates, and\nother market factors such as liquidity from\nthe perspective of a market participant. Loans\nare grouped together according to similar\ncharacteristics and treated in the aggregate\nwhen applying various valuation techniques.\nThe probability of default, loss given default\nand prepayment assumptions are the key factors\ndriving credit losses which are embedded into\nthe estimated cash flows. These assumptions\nare informed by comparable internal data on\nloan characteristics, historical loss\nexperience, and current and forecasted\neconomic conditions. The interest and\nliquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans are amortized or accreted to Interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\nloans with interest-only repayment terms or\nrevolving privileges. In the event of\nprepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums\nare recognized in Interest and fees on loans\nand leases.\n98 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nLoan Modifications\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Company enters\ninto agreements to modify the terms of loans\nto borrowers that are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The scope of these loan\nmodifications varies from portfolio to\nportfolio but generally falls into one of the\nfollowing categories:\n\n\u2022 Renewals: represent the renewal of a loan\nwhere the Company has concluded that the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nCommercial renewals result in an extension of\nthe maturity date of the loan (or in some\ncases a contraction of the loan term), and\nother significant terms of the loan (e.g.,\ninterest rate, collateral, guarantor support,\netc.) are re-evaluated in connection with the\nrenewal event.\n\n\u2022 Term extensions: represent an adjustment to\nthe maturity date of the loan that typically\nresults in a reduction to the borrower\u2019s\nscheduled payment over the remainder of the\nloan.\n\n\u2022 Capitalizations: represents the\ncapitalization of forborne loan payments\nand/or other amounts advanced on behalf of the\nborrower into the principal balance of a\nresidential mortgage loan.\n\n\u2022 Payment delays: provide the borrower with a\ntemporary postponement of loan payments that\nis considered other-than-insignificant, which\nhas been defined as a payment delay that\nexceeds 90 days, or three payment cycles, over\na rolling 12-month period. These postponed\nloan payments may result in an extension of\nthe ultimate maturity date of the loan or may\nbe capitalized into the principal balance of\nthe loan in certain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Combinations: in certain circumstances more\nthan one type of a modification is provided to\na borrower (e.g., interest rate reduction and\nterm extension).\n\n\u2022 Other: represents other types of loan\nmodifications that are not considered\nsignificant for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe Company has identified borrowers that are\nincluded in the Loan Modifications disclosures\nin \u201cNote 5. Loans and ACL\u201d as follows:\n\n\u2022 Commercial: the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of loans to commercial borrowers\nthat are rated substandard or worse and\nincludes the modifications in its disclosure\nto the extent that the modification is\nconsidered other-than-insignificant.\n\n\u2022 Consumer and credit card: loan modifications\nto consumer and credit card borrowers are\ngenerally limited to borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty. As a\nresult, the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of consumer and credit card\nloans and includes them in the disclosure to\nthe extent that they are considered other-than\ninsignificant.\nTDRs\nPrior to January 1, 2023, modifications to a\nborrower\u2019s debt agreement were considered TDRs\nif a concession was granted for economic or\nlegal reasons related to a borrower\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties that otherwise would\nnot be considered. TDRs were undertaken to\nimprove the likelihood of recovery on the loan\nand took the form of modifications that result\nin the stated interest rate of the loan being\nlower than the current market rate for new\ndebt with similar risk, other modifications to\nthe structure of the loan that fall outside of\nnormal underwriting policies and procedures,\nor in certain limited circumstances,\nforgiveness of principal or interest. A\nrestructuring that results in only a delay in\npayments that is insignificant was not\nconsidered an economic concession.\nTDRs were classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower was able\nto repay the loan based on the modified terms.\nIn circumstances where the TDR involved\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classified these TDRs as nonperforming.\nThe decision to maintain commercial TDRs on\nperforming status was based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrowers\u2019\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation included consideration of the\nborrower\u2019s current capacity to pay, which\namong other things may include a review of the\nborrower\u2019s current financial statements, an\nanalysis of cash flow available to pay debt\nobligations, and an evaluation of secondary\nsources of payment from the borrower and any\nguarantors. This evaluation also included an\nevaluation of the borrower\u2019s willingness to\npay, which could include a review of past\npayment history, an evaluation of the\nborrower\u2019s willingness to provide information\non a timely basis, and consideration of offers\nfrom the borrower to provide additional\ncollateral or guarantor support. The credit\nevaluation could also include review of cash\nflow projections, consideration of the\nadequacy of collateral to cover all principal\nand interest and trends indicating improving\nprofitability and collectability of\nreceivables.\nThe evaluation of mortgage and other consumer\nloans included an evaluation of the client\u2019s\ndebt-to-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue and certain other client-specific\nfactors that impact the clients\u2019 ability to\nmake timely principal and interest payments on\nthe loan.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 99\nNPAs\nNPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property.\nForeclosed property consists of real estate\nand other assets acquired as a result of\nclients\u2019 loan defaults. Truist\u2019s policies for\nplacing loans on nonperforming status conform\nto guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory\nauthorities. Truist classifies loans and\nleases as past due when the payment of\nprincipal and interest based upon contractual\nterms is greater than 30days delinquent or if\none payment is past due. The following table\nsummarizes the delinquency thresholds that are\na factor used in evaluating nonperforming\nclassification and the timing of charge-off\nevaluations:\n                                              \n  \u2026    P\u2026                   E\u2026                \n  \u2026    on                   f\u2026                \n  \u2026    N\u2026                   C\u2026                \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90                   \u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Loans may be returned to performing status\nwhen (i) the borrower has resumed paying the\nfull amount of the scheduled contractual\ninterest and principal payments, (ii)\nmanagement concludes that all principal and\ninterest amounts contractually due (including\narrearages) are reasonably assured of\nrepayment, and (iii) there is a sustained\nperiod of repayment performance, generally a\nminimum of six months.\n(2) The timing of nonaccrual and charge-off\nevaluations are accelerated in circumstances\nwhere the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.\n(3) Or when it is probable that principal or\ninterest is not fully collectible, whichever\noccurs first.\n(4) Depends on product type, loss mitigation\nstatus, status of the government guaranty, if\napplicable, and certain other product-specific\nfactors.\n(5) Student loans are not placed in\nnonperforming status, which reflects\nconsideration of governmental guarantees or\naccelerated charge-off policies related to\ncertain non-guaranteed portfolios.\n(6) Government guaranteed loans are considered\nto be in default once they reach 270 days past\ndue and claims are generally filed once the\nloans reach 365 days past due. The non-\nguaranteed balance, which ranges from 2-3%, is\ncharged off once the claim proceeds related to\nthe guaranteed portion have been received,\nwhich typically occurs no later than 365 days\npast due.\n(7) Credit cards are generally not placed on\nnonperforming status, but are fully charged\noff at specified delinquency dates consistent\nwith regulatory guidelines.\nWhen commercial loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, management evaluates\nwhether a charge-off must be recorded. For\ncollateral-dependent loans, this evaluation is\nbased on a comparison of the loan\u2019s carrying\nvalue to the value of the related collateral,\nwhile for non-collateral dependent loans, this\nevaluation reflects management\u2019s conclusions\nwith regard to whether any portion of the loan\nis considered uncollectible. Consumer and\ncredit card loans are subject to charge-off at\na specified delinquency date consistent with\nregulatory guidelines.\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus.\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value, less\nestimated cost to sell, and subsequently\ncarried at LOCOM. Net realizable value equals\nfair value less estimated selling costs. Any\nexcess of cost over net realizable value at\nthe time of foreclosure is charged to the\nALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic\nrevaluations of the collateral underlying\nimpaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The\nperiodic revaluations are generally based on\nthe appraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist\u2019s\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than 12months old,\notherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition of these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \u201cNote 5. Loans and\nACL.\u201d\n100 Truist Financial Corporation\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management\u2019s best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL represents management\u2019s best estimate\nof expected future credit losses related to\nits loan and lease portfolio at the balance\nsheet date. The Company\u2019s ALLL estimation\nprocess gives consideration to relevant\navailable information from internal and\nexternal sources relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. This estimation process\nincludes both quantitatively calculated\ncomponents as well as qualitative components.\nLoss estimates are informed by historical loss\nexperience that includes losses incurred on\nloans that were previously modified by the\nCompany. As a result, the Company has\nconcluded that aside from the limited\ncircumstances where principal forgiveness is\ngranted to a borrower, the financial effect of\nloan modifications is already inherently\nincluded in the ALLL. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off are\nincorporated into the ALLL estimate, with such\namounts capped at the aggregate of amounts\npreviously charged off. Changes to the ACL are\nmade by charges to the Provision for credit\nlosses, which is reflected in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. The RUFC is recorded in\nOther liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments: commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card. The expected credit\nloss models are generally developed one level\nbelow the portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans and leases are further\ndisaggregated by similar risk characteristics,\nsuch as business sector, client type, funding\ntype, and type of collateral. Larger loans and\nleases that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics or that are considered\ncollateral-dependent are individually\nevaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is\ndetermined through review of data specific to\nthe borrower and related collateral, if any.\nSuch estimates may be based on current loss\nforecasts, an evaluation of the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral or in certain\ncircumstances the present value of expected\ncash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s effective\ninterest rate as described further below.\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic forecast data,\nportfolio composition and loan attributes as\nthe primary inputs. Loss estimates are\ninformed by historical loss experience\nadjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and\ncurrent and expected portfolio risk\ncharacteristics. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough the contractual maturity of the loan\nunless the borrower has a right to renew that\nis not cancellable. In circumstances where an\nobligation is in a default state, the best\nestimate of the expected loss at the balance\nsheet date may be based on modeled losses that\noccur after the contractual maturity date of\nthe obligation. Prior to January 1, 2023, the\nloss forecasting models captured losses after\nthe maturity date of the loan for loans that\nwere reasonably expected to be modified as a\nTDR.\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for Company-sanctioned\nmacroeconomic forecast data, including the\nmacroeconomic forecast data for use in the ACL\nprocess. Forecasted economic conditions are\ndeveloped using third-party macroeconomic\nforecast data across scenarios adjusted based\non management\u2019s expectations over a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of two years.\nAssumptions revert to long term historic\naverages gradually over a one-year period.\nMacroeconomic forecast data used in estimating\nthe expected losses vary by loan portfolio and\ninclude employment factors, estimated\ncollateral values, and market indicators as\ndescribed by portfolio segment below.\nThe qualitative components of the ALLL\nestimation process incorporate management\njudgement in determining qualitative\nadjustments for circumstances where the model\noutput is inconsistent with management\u2019s\nexpectations with respect to expected credit\nlosses. The qualitative components are used to\nadjust for limitations in modeled results\nrelated to the current economic conditions,\nand considerations with respect to the impact\nof current and expected events or risks, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain and may not be\ncompletely considered by quantitative models.\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies, and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n              Truist Financial Corporation 101\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower\u2019s ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers\u2019 financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan\u2019s guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is reasonably\nassured. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management\u2019s   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting systems of models\nuse macroeconomic forecast data across\nscenarios and current portfolio attributes as\ninputs. The models forecast probability of\ndefault, exposure at default and loss given\ndefault by correlating certain macroeconomic\nforecast data to historical experience. The\nprimary macroeconomic drivers for the\ncommercial portfolios include unemployment\ntrends, U.S. real GDP, corporate credit\nspreads, and property values.\n\nTruist\u2019s policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all lending\nrelationships where non-performing exposure\nexceeds $ 5million. Prior to January 1, 2023,\nTruist included TDRs, whether performing or\nnon-performing, to the extent that they\nexceeded $ 5million. Subsequent to December\n31, 2022, Truist only includes non-performing\nloans greater than $ 5million or more, as such\nlending relationships do not typically share\nsimilar risk characteristics with others.\nIndividually evaluated reserves are based on\ncurrent forecasts, the present value of\nexpected cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s\neffective interest rate, or the value of\ncollateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories, and other types of collateral.\n\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe ALLL related to the consumer and credit\ncard lending portfolios is generally\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness, and sales channel. Consumer\nportfolio models use macroeconomic forecast\ndata across scenarios and current portfolio\nattributes as inputs. The models forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic forecast data to historical\nexperience. The primary macroeconomic drivers\nfor the consumer portfolios include\nunemployment trends, home price indices, and\nused car prices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and other\nconsumer portfolios include secured indirect\ninstallment loans to consumers for the\npurchase of new and used automobiles, boats\nand recreational vehicles. The student loan\nportfolio was composed of government\nguaranteed student loans and certain private\nstudent loans. The government guarantee\nmitigated substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. The\ncredit card portfolio and certain other\nconsumer payment solution businesses within\nthe other consumer portfolios are generally\nunsecured and are actively managed.\n\nTruist uses delinquency status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n\n102 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023 the ALLL for loans\nclassified as a TDR is based on analyses\ncapturing the expected credit losses and the\nimpact of the concessions over the remaining\nlife of the assets.\n\nExpected recoveries for loans are included in\nthe estimation of the ALLL based on historical\nexperience.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises, equipment, finance leases, and\nleasehold improvements are stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed\nprimarily using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the related\nassets and are recorded within the\ncorresponding Noninterest expense categories\non the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the\nimprovements\u2019 estimated useful lives or the\nlease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived\nasset or asset group, including premises and\nequipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of a long-\nlived asset exceeds its fair value.\nLessee operating and finance leases\nTruist has operating and finance leases for\ndata centers, corporate offices, branches,\nretail centers, and certain equipment.\nOperating leases with an original lease term\nin excess of one year are included in Other\nassets and Other liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases\nare included in Premises and equipment and\nLong-term debt in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term. Lease\nliabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating and finance lease assets and\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement\ndate based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. Operating lease\ncosts are recorded in Net occupancy expense or\nEquipment expense based on the underlying\nasset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate\nin determining the present value of lease\npayments when readily determinable, and a\ncollateralized incremental borrowing rate when\nan implicit rate is not available. Lease terms\nconsider options to extend or terminate based\non the determination of whether such renewal\nor termination options are deemed reasonably\ncertain.\nLease agreements that contain non-lease\ncomponents are generally accounted for as a\nsingle lease component. Variable costs, such\nas maintenance expenses, property and sales\ntaxes, association dues and index-based rate\nincreases, are expensed as they are incurred.\nThe impairment policy for a ROU asset is\ndiscussed within the Premises and Equipment\nsection above.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nLife insurance policies on certain current and\nformer directors, officers and teammates, for\nwhich Truist is the owner and beneficiary are\nstated at the cash surrender value within\nOther assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Changes in cash surrender value and\nproceeds from insurance benefits are recorded\nin Other income in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. These policies provide the Company\nan efficient form of funding for retirement\nand other employee benefits costs. See \u201cNote\n9. Other Assets and Liabilities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified tax credit investments. In\ncomputing the provision for income taxes, the\nCompany evaluates the technical merits of its\nincome tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The proportional amortization method\nof accounting is used on affordable housing\nand other qualified tax credit investments,\nsuch that the initial cost of the investment\ngiving rise to tax credits is amortized in\nproportion to the allocation of tax credits\nand other income tax benefits in each period\nas a component of the provision for income\ntaxes. Truist includes the initial investment\ncash flows and subsequent credits within\noperating activities in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Additionally, the\nCompany recognizes all excess tax benefits and\ndeficiencies on employee share-based payments\nas a component of the Provision for income\ntaxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. These tax effects, generally\ndetermined upon the exercise of stock options\nor vesting of equity compensation awards, are\ntreated as discrete items in the period in\nwhich they occur. For additional information\nrelated to the Company\u2019s unrealized gains and\nlosses, see \u201cNote 13. AOCI.\u201d\nDTAs and DTLs result from differences between\nthe timing of the recognition of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes\nand for income tax purposes. These deferred\nassets and liabilities are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected\nto apply in the periods in which the DTAs or\nDTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent\nchanges in the tax laws require adjustment to\nthese deferred assets and liabilities with the\ncumulative effect included in the Provision\nfor income taxes for the period in which the\nchange is enacted. A valuation allowance is\nrecognized for a DTA if, based on the weight\nof available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that some portion or all of the DTA will\nnot be realized.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 103\nInterest and penalties related to the\nCompany\u2019s tax positions are recognized in the\nProvision for income taxes in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s activities\nrelated to income taxes, see \u201cNote 14. Income\nTaxes.\u201d\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company records derivative contracts at\nfair value in Other assets and Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends upon whether or\nnot it has been designated in a formal,\nqualifying hedging relationship. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives not designated\nin a hedging relationship are recognized\nwithin Noninterest income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. This includes\nderivatives that the Company enters into in a\ndealer capacity to facilitate client\ntransactions and as a risk management tool to\neconomically hedge certain identified risks\nassociated with assets carried at fair value\nsuch as MSRs, along with certain interest rate\nlock commitments on residential mortgage and\ncommercial loans that are a normal part of the\nCompany\u2019s operations. The Company also\nevaluates its financial contracts to determine\nwhether any embedded derivatives are required\nto be bifurcated and separately accounted for\nas freestanding derivatives.\nCertain derivatives used as risk management\ntools are designated as accounting hedges and\nare used to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates or other identified\nmarket risks. The Company prepares written\nhedge documentation for all derivatives which\nare designated as hedges of (i) changes in the\nfair value of a recognized asset or liability\n(fair value hedge) attributable to a specified\nrisk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as\nthe variability of cash flows to be received\nor paid related to a recognized asset or\nliability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge\ndocumentation includes identification of,\namong other items, the risk management\nobjective, hedging instrument, hedged item,\nand methodologies for assessing and measuring\nhedge effectiveness, along with support for\nmanagement\u2019s assertion that the hedge will be\nhighly effective. Methodologies related to\nhedge effectiveness include (i) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the cash\nflows of the actual derivative and\nhypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the fair\nvalues of the actual derivative and the hedged\nitem.\nFor designated hedging relationships, the\nCompany generally performs subsequent\nassessments of hedge effectiveness using a\nqualitative approach.\nBelow is a summary of the cash flow and fair\nvalue hedge programs utilized by Truist:\n

Company to risk that\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract\ndoes not perform as expected. The Company\nmanages its exposures to counterparty credit\nrisk associated with derivatives by entering\ninto transactions with counterparties with\ndefined exposure limits based on their credit\nquality and in accordance with established\npolicies and procedures. All counterparties\nare reviewed regularly as part of the\nCompany\u2019s credit risk management practices and\nappropriate action is taken to adjust the\nexposure limits to certain counterparties as\nnecessary. The Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions are generally governed by ISDA\nagreements or other legally enforceable\nindustry standard master netting agreements.\nIn certain cases and depending on the nature\nof the underlying derivative transactions,\nbilateral collateral agreements are also\nutilized.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject\nto OTC derivative clearing requirements, which\nrequire certain derivatives to be cleared\nthrough central clearing houses. These\nclearing houses require the Company to post\ninitial and variation margin to mitigate the\nrisk of non-payment, the latter of which is\nreceived or paid daily based on the net asset\nor liability of the contracts. The Company\napplies settlement to market treatment for the\ncash collateralizing derivative contracts with\ncertain centrally cleared counterparties.\n\nWhen the Company has more than one outstanding\nderivative transaction with a single\ncounterparty, and there exists a legal right\nof setoff with that counterparty, the Company\nconsiders its exposure to the counterparty to\nbe the net fair value of its derivative\npositions with that counterparty. If the net\nfair value is positive, then the corresponding\nasset value also reflects cash collateral\nheld. The Company offsets derivative\ntransactions with a single counterparty as\nwell as any cash collateral paid to and\nreceived from that counterparty for derivative\ncontracts that are subject to ISDA or other\nlegally enforceable netting arrangements and\nmeet accounting guidance for offsetting\ntreatment.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nderivative activities, see \u201cNote 18. Fair\nValue Disclosures\u201d and \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the\nfair value of net assets acquired (including\nidentifiable intangibles) in transactions\naccounted for as business combinations. Truist\nallocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s)\nthat are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the business combination.\nThe goodwill of each reporting unit is\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis as\nof October 1 or more often if events or\ncircumstances indicate that it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying value. If, after\nassessing all relevant events or\ncircumstances, Truist concludes that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value,\nthen a quantitative impairment test is\nrequired. Truist may also elect to bypass the\nqualitative assessment and proceed directly to\na quantitative impairment test. In the\nquantitative test, the fair value of a\nreporting unit is compared to the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit. If the fair value\nof a reporting unit is greater than the\ncarrying value, then there is no impairment.\nIf the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue, then an impairment loss is recorded for\nthe amount that the carrying value exceeds the\nfair value, not to exceed the total amount of\ngoodwill assigned to the reporting unit.\nThe quantitative impairment test estimates the\nfair value of the reporting units using the\nincome and market-based approaches. The inputs\nand assumptions specific to each reporting\nunit are incorporated in the valuations,\nincluding projections of future cash flows,\ndiscount rates, and applicable valuation\nmultiples based on the comparable public\ncompany information. The income approach\nutilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of\nmulti-year financial forecasts developed for\neach reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions. The market based\napproach utilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples, and\nconsiders a market control premium associated\nwith cost synergies and other cash flow\nbenefits that arise from obtaining control\nover a reporting unit, and guideline\ntransactions, when applicable. Truist also\nassesses the reasonableness of the aggregate\nestimated fair value of the reporting units by\ncomparison to its market capitalization over a\nreasonable period of time, including\nconsideration of historic bank control\npremiums and the current market.\nCDI and other intangible assets include\npremiums paid for acquisitions of core\ndeposits and other identifiable intangible\nassets. Intangible assets other than goodwill,\nwhich are determined to have finite lives, are\namortized over their useful lives, based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits received. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nactivities related to goodwill and other\nintangibles, see \u201cNote 7. Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets.\u201d\n              Truist Financial Corporation 105\nLoan Servicing Rights\nTruist has three classes of servicing rights\nfor which it separately manages the economic\nrisks: residential MSRs, commercial MSRs, and\nother loan servicing rights. Loan servicing\nrights are accounted for at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in Mortgage\nbanking income and Other income on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. The fair\nvalue of servicing rights is impacted by a\nvariety of factors, including prepayment\nassumptions, discount rates, delinquency\nrates, contractually specified servicing fees,\nservicing costs, and underlying portfolio\ncharacteristics. These risks are hedged with\nvarious derivative instruments that are\nintended to mitigate the income statement\neffect to changes in fair value. The\nunderlying assumptions and estimated values\nare corroborated by values received from\nindependent third parties and comparisons to\nmarket transactions. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s servicing rights,\nsee \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing.\u201d\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Depending on the nature of the asset or\nliability, the Company uses various valuation\ntechniques and assumptions when estimating\nfair value. The Company classifies inputs used\nin valuation techniques within the fair value\nhierarchy discussed in \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nWhen measuring assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue, the Company considers the principal or\nmost advantageous market in which it would\ntransact and considers assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset\nor liability. Assets and liabilities that are\nrequired to be measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis include trading securities,\nderivative instruments, AFS securities, and\ncertain other equity securities. Assets and\nliabilities that the Company has elected to\nmeasure at fair value on a recurring basis\ninclude trading loans, loans originated to be\nsold and classified as LHFS, and loan\nservicing rights. Other assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, such as when assets are evaluated for\nimpairment, and subsequently carried at LOCOM.\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nvaluation of assets and liabilities held at\nfair value, see \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nEquity-Based Compensation\nTruist maintains various equity-based\ncompensation plans that provide for the\ngranting of RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs to selected\nteammates and directors. Truist values share-\nbased awards at the grant date fair value and\nrecognizes the expense over the requisite\nservice period taking into account retirement\neligibility. Compensation expense is\nrecognized in Personnel expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures\nare recognized as they occur. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation plans, see \u201cNote 15. Benefit\nPlans.\u201d\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions.\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure\nthe postretirement benefit obligations is set\nby reference to an AA Above Median corporate\nbond yield curve and the individual\ncharacteristics of the plans such as projected\ncash flow patterns and payment durations. The\nexpected long-term rate of return on assets is\nbased on the expected returns for each major\nasset class in which the plan invests,\nadjusted for the weight of each asset class in\nthe target mix. For additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s pension plans and postretirement\nbenefit plans, see \u201cNote 15. Benefit Plans.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCompany recognizes two primary types of\nrevenue in its Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, Interest income, and Noninterest\nincome. The Company\u2019s principal source of\nrevenue is Interest income from loans and\nsecurities, which is recognized on an accrual\nbasis using the effective interest method. For\ninformation on the Company\u2019s policies for\nrecognizing Interest income on loans and\nsecurities, see the \u201cLoans and Leases,\u201d\n\u201cLHFS,\u201d \u201cTrading Activities,\u201d and \u201cInvestment\nSecurities\u201d sections within this Note.\nNoninterest income includes revenue from\nvarious types of transactions and services\nprovided to clients. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from contracts with customers as\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nPerformance obligations are typically\nsatisfied in one year or less. Truist elected\nthe practical expedient to expense the\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract when\nincurred when the amortization period is one\nyear or less. As of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, remaining performance obligations\nconsisted primarily of insurance and\ninvestment banking services for contracts with\nan original expected length of one year or\nless.\n106 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInsurance income\n\nInsurance commissions are received on the sale\nof insurance products as agent or broker, and\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time upon\nthe placement date of the insurance policies,\nrepresenting the Company\u2019s related performance\nobligations. Payment is normally received\nwithin the policy period. In addition to\nplacement, Truist also provides insurance\npolicy related risk management services. The\nCompany\u2019s execution of these risk management\nservices represents its performance\nobligations. Revenue is recognized over time\nas these services are provided. Performance-\nbased commissions are recognized when received\nor earlier when, upon consideration of past\nresults and current conditions, the revenue is\ndeemed not probable of reversal. Insurance\ncommissions are included in the IH operating\nsegment. Refer to \u201cNote 21. Operating\nSegments\u201d for information on segment results.\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues include\nWealth management income, Investment banking\nincome, Service charges on deposits, and Card\nand payment related fees. Revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time when the\ntransactions occur or over time as services\nare performed primarily over monthly or\nquarterly periods. Payment is typically\nreceived in the period the transactions occur\nor, in some cases, within 90 days of the\nservice period. Fees may be fixed or, where\napplicable, based on a percentage of\ntransaction size or managed assets. These\nrevenues, and their relationship to the\nCompany\u2019s operating segments, are further\ndescribed by type below. Refer to \u201cNote 21.\nOperating Segments\u201d for information on segment\nresults.\n\nWealth management income includes trust and\ninvestment management income, retail\ninvestment and brokerage services, and\ninvestment advisory and other specialty wealth\nmanagement fees. The Company\u2019s execution of\nthese services represents its related\nperformance obligations. The Company generally\nrecognizes trust and investment management and\nadvisory revenue over time as services are\nrendered based on either a percentage of the\nmarket value of the assets under management or\nadvisement, or fixed based on the services\nprovided to the client. Fees are generally\nswept from the client\u2019s account either in\nadvance of or in arrears based on the prior\nperiod\u2019s asset balances under management or\nadvisement. The Company also offers selling\nand distribution services and earns\ncommissions through the sale of annuity and\nmutual fund products, acting as agent in these\ntransactions and recognizing revenue at a\npoint in time when the client enters into an\nagreement with the product carrier. The\nCompany may also receive trailing commissions\nand 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and\nannuity products and recognizes this revenue\nin the period earned. Retail trade execution\ncommissions are earned and recognized on the\ntrade date with payment on the settlement\ndate. Wealth management income is included in\nthe CB&W operating segment.\n\nInvestment banking and trading income includes\nsecurities underwriting fees, advisory fees,\nloan syndication fees, structured real estate\nincome, and trade execution services revenue.\nUnderwriting fees are earned on the trade date\nwhen the Company, as a member of an\nunderwriting syndicate, purchases the\nsecurities from the issuer and sells the\nsecurities to third-party investors. Each\nmember of the syndicate is responsible for\nselling its portion of the underwriting and is\nliable for the proportionate costs of the\nunderwriting; therefore, the Company\u2019s portion\nof underwriting revenue and expense is\npresented gross within noninterest income and\nnoninterest expense. The transaction price is\nbased on a percentage of the total transaction\namount and payments are settled shortly after\nthe trade date. Fees for merger and\nacquisition advisory services, including\nvarious activities such as business valuation,\nidentification of potential targets or\nacquirers, and the issuance of fairness\nopinions, are generally earned and recognized\nby the Company when performance obligations\nare satisfied. The Company\u2019s execution of the\nadvisory services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. The transaction price is based on\ncontractually specified terms agreed upon with\nthe client for each advisory service. Loan\nsyndication fees are typically recognized at\nthe closing of a loan syndication transaction.\nStructured real estate income is recognized\nwhen an existing build-to-suit or sale-\nleaseback asset is sold. The proceeds, net of\nclosing costs, are reduced by the carrying\nvalue of the underlying leased asset. Revenue\nrelated to corporate trade execution services\nis earned and recognized on the trade date\nwith payment on the settlement date.\nInvestment banking and trading income is\nincluded in the C&CB operating segment.\n\nService charges on deposits include account\nmaintenance, cash and treasury management,\nwire transfers, ATM, overdraft, and other\ndeposit-related fees. The Company\u2019s execution\nof the services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. Each\nof these performance obligations are either\nsatisfied over time or at a point in time as\nthe services are provided to the client. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. Payments for services provided are\neither withdrawn from client accounts as\nservices are rendered or in the billing period\nfollowing the completion of the service. The\ntransaction price for each of these fees is\nbased on the Company\u2019s predetermined fee\nschedules. Service charges on deposits are\nrecognized in the CB&W and C&CB operating\nsegments.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 107\nCard and payment related fees include\ninterchange fees from credit and debit cards,\nmerchant acquirer revenue, and other card\nrelated services. Interchange fees are earned\nby the Company each time a request for payment\nis initiated by a client at a merchant for\nwhich the Company transfers the funds on\nbehalf of the client. Interchange rates are\nset by the payment network and are based on\npurchase volumes and other factors.\nInterchange fees are received daily and\nrecognized at a point in time when the card\ntransaction is processed, which represents the\nCompany\u2019s related performance obligation. The\nCompany is considered an agent of the client\nand incurs costs with the payment network to\nfacilitate the interchange with the merchant;\ntherefore, the related payment network expense\nis recognized as a reduction of card fees.\nTruist also offers rewards and/or rebates to\nits client based on card usage. The costs\nassociated with these programs are recognized\nas a reduction of card fees. Card and payment\nrelated fees are recognized in the CB&W and\nC&CB operating segments.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is\ncomputed by dividing net income available to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during\neach period, plus common share equivalents\ncalculated for stock options, warrants, and\nrestricted stock outstanding using the\ntreasury stock method, except in a net loss\nwhere diluted EPS is equal to basic. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s EPS,\nsee \u201cNote 20. Computation of EPS.\u201d\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company periodically enters into\ntransactions with certain of its executive\nofficers, directors, affiliates, trusts,\nand/or other related parties in its ordinary\ncourse of business.

In\nconnection with the transaction, the\nnoncontrolling interest holder received\nprofits interest representing 3.75% coverage\non TIH\u2019s fully diluted equity value at\ntransaction close, and certain consent and\nexit rights commensurate with a noncontrolling\ninvestor. Including these profits interests,\nthe noncontrolling interest holder is\nallocated approximately 23% of TIH pretax net\nincome. Also in conjunction with the same\ntransaction, TIH granted certain event-vested\nprofits interests and appreciation units,\nrepresenting 4.50% coverage on TIH\u2019s fully\ndiluted equity value at grant, to various TIH\nemployees and officers in the second quarter\nof 2023. These awards, subject to continued\nemployment through the applicable event or\ndate, will vest either upon, or from six\nmonths to two years following, a change in\ncontrol of TIH, depending on the nature of the\nchange in control.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining 80% stake\nof the common equity in TIH to an investor\ngroup led by Stone Point Capital LLC for a\npurchase price that implies an enterprise\nvalue for TIH of $ 15.5billion, and is\nexpected to result in cash proceeds to Truist\nof approximately $ 10.1billion after-tax,\nreflecting certain closing adjustments for\ncash, debt and debt-like items, including the\nsettlement of certain previously granted TIH\nawards, working capital, transaction expenses\nand an investor return amount associated with\nthe originally sold 20% stake. The transaction\nimproves Truist\u2019s relative capital position\nand allows Truist to maintain strategic\nflexibility. The transaction is expected to\nclose in the second quarter of 2024, subject\nto customary closing conditions and regulatory\napprovals. Upon closing, the transaction will\nresult in a full deconsolidation of the TIH\nsubsidiary from Truist, and an expected gain\nequal to the excess of after-tax cash proceeds\nover Truist\u2019s approximate $ 5.4billion\ninvestment in its TIH subsidiary.\n\n110 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 3.

Charge-\noffs include $ 98million related to the sale.\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 515million and\nthe consumer ALLL decreased $ 119million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. The increase\nin the commercial ALLL primarily reflects an\nincrease in reserves related to the CRE and\ncommercial construction portfolios. The\ndecrease in the consumer ALLL for the year-to-\ndate period primarily reflects the sale of the\nstudent loan portfolio in the second quarter,\nas well as impacts associated with the\nadoption of the Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosure accounting standard in\nthe first quarter of 2023. These decreases\nwere partially offset by an increase related\nto the other consumer portfolio that was\nprimarily driven by loan growth.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 117\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nU.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nproperty values, home price indices, and used\ncar prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the December 31, 2023 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2022. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, the\nforecast scenario reflected deterioration in\ncertain economic variables (e.g., GDP) over\nthe reasonable and supportable forecast period\nwhen compared to the prior year. The overall\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nDecember 31, 2023 included GDP growth in the\nlow-single digits and an unemployment rate\nnear mid-single digits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The December\n31, 2023 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

amount.\n\n120 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist closely monitors the performance of the\nloans that are modified to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty to\nunderstand the effectiveness

Based\non the results of the impairment analyses, the\nCompany concluded that the carrying values of\nthe CB&W and C&CB reporting units exceed their\nrespective fair values, resulting in a non-\ncash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment\ncharge of $6.1 billion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The fair value of the CB&W\nand C&CB reporting units were estimated using\nthe income approach and a market-based\napproach, weighted 50% and 50%, respectively.\nThe goodwill impairment was primarily due to\nthe continued impact of higher interest rates\nand discount rates on the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units, and a sustained decline in\nthe banking industry share prices, including\nTruist\u2019s. The goodwill impairment has no\nimpact on Truist\u2019s liquidity, regulatory\ncapital ratios, or Truist\u2019s ability to pay its\ncommon dividend and service its clients\u2019\nfinancial needs. The Company monitored events\nand circumstances during the period from\nOctober 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023,\nincluding macroeconomic and market factors,\nindustry and banking sector events, Truist\nspecific performance indicators, a comparison\nof management\u2019s forecast and assumptions to\nthose used in its October 1, 2023 quantitative\nimpairment test, and the sensitivity of the\nOctober 1, 2023 quantitative test results to\nchanges in assumptions through December 31,\n2023. Based on these considerations, the\nCompany concluded that it was not more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of one or more of\nits reporting units is below its respective\ncarrying amount as of December 31, 2023. Refer\nto \u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d for\nadditional information.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill\nattributable to operating segments are\nreflected in the table below. Activity during\n2023 includes the aforementioned impairments\nand the realignment of Prime Rate Premium\nFinance Corporation into the C&CB segment from\nthe IH segment.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company\u2019s\nfederal income tax returns are no longer\nsubject to assessment by the IRS for taxable\nyears prior to 2020. With limited exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to assessment\nby state and local taxing authorities for\ntaxable years prior to 2018. It is reasonably\npossible that the liability for unrecognized\ntax benefits could decrease by as much as $\n34million during the next 12 months due to\ncompletion of tax authority examinations and\nthe expiration of statutes of limitations. It\nis uncertain how much, if any, of this\npotential decrease will impact the Company\u2019s\neffective tax rate.\n\n130 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Commitments and Contingencies      \n                                              \nTruist utilizes a variety of financial\ninstruments to mitigate exposure to risks and\nmeet the financing needs and provide\ninvestment opportunities for clients. These\nfinancial instruments include commitments to\nextend credit, letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, derivatives, and other\ninvestments. Truist also has commitments to\nfund certain affordable housing investments\nand contingent liabilities related to certain\nsold loans.\n\nTax Credit and Certain Equity Investments\n\nThe Company invests in certain affordable\nhousing projects throughout its market area as\na means of supporting local communities.\nTruist receives tax credits related to these\ninvestments, for which the Company typically\nacts as a limited partner and therefore does\nnot exert control over the operating or\nfinancial policies of the partnerships. Truist\ntypically provides financing during the\nconstruction and development of the\nproperties; however, permanent financing is\ngenerally obtained from independent third\nparties upon completion of a project. Tax\ncredits are subject to recapture by taxing\nauthorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level.\nTruist\u2019s maximum potential exposure to losses\nrelative to investments in VIEs is generally\nlimited to the sum of the outstanding balance,\nfuture funding commitments and any related\nloans to the entity, exclusive of any\npotential tax recapture associated with the\ninvestments. Loans to these entities are\nunderwritten in substantially the same manner\nas the Company\u2019s other loans and are generally\nsecured.\n\nThe Company invests as a limited partner in\ncertain projects through the New Market Tax\nCredit program, which is a Federal financial\nprogram aimed to stimulate business and real\nestate investment in underserved communities\nvia a Federal tax credit. Following the first\nquarter of 2023 adoption of the Investments in\nTax Credit Structures accounting standard,\nthese tax credits, referred to as \u201cOther\nqualified tax credits\u201d below, qualify for the\nproportional amortization method. The Company\nalso applied the proportional amortization\nmethod to investments through the Production\nTax Credits program. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis\nof Presentation\u201d for additional information.\n\nThe Company also invests in entities that\npromote renewable energy sources as a limited\npartner. The Company has determined that these\nrenewable energy tax credit partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these VIEs because\nit does not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIEs\u2019 financial performance and therefore, it\nis not required to consolidate these VIEs. The\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to\nthese investments is limited to its equity\ninvestments in these partnerships and any\nadditional unfunded equity commitments.\n\nTruist has investments in and future funding\ncommitments related to private equity and\ncertain other equity method investments. The\nrisk exposure relating to such commitments is\ngenerally limited to the amount of investments\nand future funding commitments made.\nThe following table summarizes certain tax\ncredit and certain equity investments:\n                                              \n  (Dol\u2026    Balan\u2026          Dec                \n  in       Sheet           31,       Dec 31,  \n  mill\u2026    Locat\u2026         2023          2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Inve\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  affo\u2026                                       \n  hous\u2026                                       \n  proj\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  qual\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  cred\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026    Other     $   6,754    $    5,869  \n  amou\u2026    assets                             \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  futu\u2026                                       \n  fund\u2026    Other                              \n  comm\u2026    liabi\u2026        2,473         1,762  \n  incl\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n           Loans                              \n           and                                \n  Lend\u2026    leases        1,981         1,547  \n  expo\u2026    for                                \n           funded                             \n           amoun\u2026                             \n  Rene\u2026                                       \n  ener\u2026                                       \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026    Other           285           264  \n  amou\u2026    assets                             \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  futu\u2026                                       \n  fund\u2026                                       \n  comm\u2026    NA              747           361  \n  not                                         \n  incl\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  SBIC                                        \n  and                                         \n  cert\u2026                                       \n  other                                       \n  equi\u2026                                       \n  meth\u2026                                       \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026    Other           758           596  \n  amou\u2026    assets                             \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  futu\u2026                                       \n  fund\u2026                                       \n  comm\u2026    NA              589           532  \n  not                                         \n  incl\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n                                              \n134 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents a summary of tax\ncredits and amortization expense associated\nwith the Company\u2019s tax credit investment\nactivity.

As a result,\namortization related to these tax credits\nstarted being recognized in the Provision for\nincome taxes as of the adoption of this\nstandard. This activity was previously\nrecognized in Other income. Refer to \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nLetters of Credit and Financial Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, Truist\nutilizes certain financial instruments to meet\nthe financing needs of clients and to mitigate\nexposure to risks. Such financial instruments\ninclude commitments to extend credit and\ncertain contractual agreements, including\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantee arrangements.\n\nCommitments to extend, originate, or purchase\ncredit are primarily lines of credit to\nbusinesses and consumers and have specified\nrates and maturity dates. Many of these\ncommitments also have adverse change clauses,\nwhich allow Truist to cancel the commitment\ndue to deterioration in the borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness. The fair values of\ncommitments are estimated using the fees\ncharged to enter into similar agreements,\ntaking into account the remaining terms of the\nagreements and the present creditworthiness of\nthe counterparties. The fair values of\nguarantees and letters of credit are estimated\nbased on the counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness\nand average default rates for loan products\nwith similar risks. Consumer lending and\nrevolving credit commitments have an\nimmaterial fair value as Truist typically has\nthe unconditional ability to cancel such\ncommitments. Refer to \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures\u201d for additional disclosures on the\nRUFC.\n\nTruist has sold certain mortgage-related loans\nthat contain recourse provisions. These\nprovisions generally require Truist to\nreimburse the investor for a share of any loss\nthat is incurred after the disposal of the\nproperty. Truist also issues standard\nrepresentations and warranties related to\nmortgage loan sales to GSEs.

A derivative\nis a financial instrument that derives its\ncash flows, and therefore its value, by\nreference to an underlying instrument, index,\nor referenced interest rate. Derivative\ncontracts are carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with the fair\nvalue representing the net present value of\nexpected future cash receipts or payments\nbased on market interest rates. For additional\ninformation on derivative instruments, see\n\u201cNote 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.\u201d\n              Truist Financial Corporation 135\nTotal Return Swaps\n\nThe Company facilitates matched book TRS\ntransactions on behalf of clients, whereby a\nVIE purchases reference assets identified by a\nclient and the Company enters into a TRS with\nthe VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the\nclient. The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third-party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases. VIE assets\ninclude trading loans and bonds:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  VIE          $       1,641    $      1,830  \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  loans and            1,572           1,790  \n  bonds                                       \n  VIE                     50             163  \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n                                              \nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, which could potentially be\nsignificant. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets, and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nOther Commitments\n\nTruist holds public funds in certain states\nthat do not require 100% collateralization on\npublic fund bank deposits. In these states,\nshould the failure of another public fund\ndepository institution result in a loss for\nthe public entity, the resulting\nuncollateralized deposit shortfall would have\nto be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon\nthe public deposits held by each bank within\nthe respective state) by the remaining\nfinancial institutions holding public funds in\nthat state. Truist monitors deposit levels\nrelative to the total public deposits held by\nall depository institutions within these\nstates. The likelihood that the Company would\nhave to perform under this guarantee is\ndependent on whether any financial\ninstitutions holding public funds default, as\nwell as the adequacy of collateral coverage.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Truist\nindemnifies its officers and directors to the\nfullest extent permitted by law against\nliabilities arising from pending litigation.\nTruist also issues standard representations\nand warranties in underwriting agreements,\nmerger and acquisition agreements, loan sales,\nbrokerage activities and other similar\narrangements. Counterparties in many of these\nindemnification arrangements provide similar\nindemnifications to Truist. Although these\nagreements often do not specify limitations,\nTruist does not believe that any payments\nrelated to these guarantees would materially\nchange the financial position or results of\noperations of Truist.\n\nAs a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to\nmaintain a minimum investment in capital\nstock. The board of directors of the FHLB can\nincrease the minimum investment requirements\nin the event it has concluded that additional\ncapital is required to allow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital requirements. Any\nincrease in the minimum investment\nrequirements outside of specified ranges\nrequires the approval of the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency. Because the extent of any\nobligation to increase Truist\u2019s investment in\nthe FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence\nof a future event, potential future\ninvestments in the FHLB stock are not\ndeterminable.\n\nThe Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation for trade comparisons, netting,\nand settlement of fixed income securities. As\na Government Securities Division netting\nmember, the Company has a commitment to the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation to meet its\nfinancial obligations as a central\ncounterparty clearing house in the event the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation has\ninsufficient liquidity resources through a\npotential committed liquidity resource\nrepurchase transaction. Any commitment would\nbe based on the Company\u2019s share of its\nliquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Truist does not believe that any\npayments related to these guarantees would\nmaterially change the financial position or\nresults of operations of Truist.\n\n136 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

Our legal\nproceedings and other matters exist in varying\nstages of adjudication, arbitration,\nnegotiation, or investigation and span our\nbusiness lines and operations.\n\nThe course and outcome of legal proceedings\nand other matters are inherently\nunpredictable. This is especially so when a\nmatter is still in its early stages, the\ndamages sought are indeterminate or\nunsupported, significant facts are unclear or\ndisputed, novel questions of law or other\nmeaningful legal uncertainties exist, a\nrequest to certify a proceeding as a class\naction is outstanding or granted, multiple\nparties are named, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental entities are involved. As a\nresult, we often are unable to determine how\nor when actual or threatened legal proceedings\nand other matters will be resolved and what\nlosses may be incrementally and ultimately\nincurred. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal\nproceedings and other matters when potential\nlosses become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. Accruals are\nevaluated each quarter and may be adjusted,\nupward or downward, based on our best judgment\nafter consultation with counsel and others. No\nassurance exists that our accruals will not\nneed to be adjusted in the future. Actual\nlosses may be higher or lower than any amounts\naccrued, possibly to a significant degree.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 350million as of December 31,\n2023. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company judged the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nmay change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses, like accruals, are based upon\ncurrently available information and involve\nconsiderable uncertainties and judgment.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the matter\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. These matters are\nnot accrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 137\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings and other matters in which\nTruist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint\nasserts claims for violations of civil and\ncriminal usury laws, conversion, and money had\nand received, and seeks damages on a class-\nwide basis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. On\nbehalf of the certified class as currently\ndefined, Plaintiff seeks a return of up to $\n452million in paid overdraft fees from the\n2006 to 2017 period above, plus prejudgment\ninterest which, based on the amount of claimed\nfees, was estimated to be approximately $\n400million as of December 31, 2023. On October\n31, 2023, Truist filed motions to amend the\nclass definition to narrow the scope of the\nclass, to compel arbitration against certain\nclass members, and for summary judgment, which\nwere heard by the court on February 14, 2024,\nand are pending. A court-ordered mediation is\nscheduled for February 28, 2024, and trial is\npresently set to commence on April 29, 2024.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has\nsubstantial defenses against the underlying\nclaims.\n\nRecordkeeping Matters\n\nThe SEC and CFTC have requested information\nfrom various subsidiaries of the Company that\nconduct broker-dealer, investment adviser, and\nswap dealer activities regarding compliance\nwith applicable recordkeeping requirements for\nbusiness-related electronic communications.\nThe Company has cooperated with these requests\nand is in advanced discussions regarding\nresolutions of these matters with the agencies\nthough there can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of these discussions. The SEC and CFTC\nhave been conducting similar investigations of\nother financial institutions regarding\nbusiness-related communications sent over\nunapproved electronic messaging channels and\nhave entered into a number of resolutions with\nvarious institutions to date.\n\nInvestigation Regarding Trusts\n\nIn 2016 and 2018, the Civil Division of the\nU.S. DOJ issued subpoenas to a corporate\npredecessor of Truist Bank under the Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement\nAct. These subpoenas requested documents and\nother information related to specified trusts\nfor which Truist Bank serves as trustee. U.S.\nDOJ has recently requested additional\ninformation, and Truist Bank is continuing to\ncooperate in the investigation.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule\nto implement a special assessment to recoup\nlosses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in the first half of 2023. The\nassessment is based on an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022. The special\nassessment for Truist is $ 507million, which\nwas recognized in Q4 2023 and will be paid in\neight quarterly installments beginning in\n2024. The ultimate amount of expenses\nassociated with the special assessment will\nalso be impacted by the finalization of the\nlosses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions\nof Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,\nwhich could result in additional expense.\n\n138 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\n\nTruist Bank is subject to laws and regulations\nthat limit the amount of dividends it can pay.\nIn addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to various regulatory restrictions\nrelating to the payment of dividends,\nincluding requirements to maintain capital at\nor above regulatory minimums, and to remain\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective\naction regulations.\n\nTruist is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements administered by the\nFederal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements. Under capital\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany must meet specific capital guidelines\nthat involve quantitative measures of assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated pursuant to regulatory\ndirectives. Truist\u2019s capital amounts and\nclassification also are subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings and other factors.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\ninvestments totaling $ 459million and $\n385million, respectively, have been excluded\nfrom the table above as they are valued based\non net asset value as a practical expedient.\nThese investments primarily consist of certain\nSBIC funds.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nfor Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities\nthat are measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis.\n\nAvailable for Sale and Trading Securities:\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available-for-sale and trading\nportfolios. The Company uses prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes, or\nrecent trades to estimate the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of AFS securities\nwere priced by third-party vendors whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. The\nAFS securities and trading securities are\nsubject to IPV. Management independently\nevaluates the fair values of AFS Securities\nand trading securities through comparisons to\nexternal pricing sources, review of additional\ninformation provided by the pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on any security sales to the\npricing information received from the pricing\nservice. Fair value measurements for trading\nsecurities are derived from observable market-\nbased information including, but not limited\nto, overall market conditions, recent trades,\ncomparable securities, broker quotes and\nFINRA\u2019s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\ndata when determining the value of a position.\nSecurity prices are also validated through\nactual cash settlement upon the sale of a\nsecurity. As described by security type below,\nadditional inputs may be used, or some inputs\nmay not be applicable.\n\nTrading loans: The Company has elected to\nmeasure trading loans at fair value. Trading\nloans are valued primarily using quoted prices\nfor similar instruments in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active by\na third-party pricing service. Trading loans\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 loans held in connection with the Company\u2019s\ntrading business primarily consisting of\ncommercial and corporate leveraged loans;\n\n\u2022 loans made or acquired in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s TRS business; and\n\n\u2022 SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government\nfor December 31, 2022 only.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 141\nU.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities\nare valued using quoted prices in active over-\nthe-counter markets.\n\nGSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities\nconsist of debt obligations issued by U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development,\nthe FHLB, and other agencies, as well as\nsecurities collateralized by loans that are\nguaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. Agency MBS includes pass-through\nsecurities and CMOs issued by GSEs and U.S.\ngovernment agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and\nGNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by\nthe issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including benchmark TBA security\npricing and yield curves that were estimated\nbased on U.S. Treasury yields and certain\nfloating rate indices. The pricing matrices\nfor these securities may also give\nconsideration to pool-specific data supplied\ndirectly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using\nmarket-based pricing matrices that are based\non observable inputs including offers, bids,\nreported trades, dealer quotes and market\nresearch reports, the characteristics of a\nspecific tranche, market convention prepayment\nspeeds and benchmark yield curves as described\nabove.\n\nStates and political subdivisions: The\nCompany\u2019s investments in U.S. states and\npolitical subdivisions include obligations of\ncounty and municipal authorities and agency\nbonds, which are general obligations of the\nmunicipality or are supported by a specified\nrevenue source. Holdings are geographically\ndispersed, with no significant concentrations\nin any one state or municipality.\nAdditionally, all municipal obligations are\nhighly rated or are otherwise collateralized\nby securities backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the federal government. These\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer\nspreads, material event notices and benchmark\nyield curves.\n\nNon-agency MBS: Non-agency MBS included\npurchased interests in third-party\nsecuritizations that have a high investment\ngrade rating, and the pricing matrices for\nthese securities were based on observable\ninputs including offers, bids, reported\ntrades, dealer quotes and market research\nreports, the characteristics of a specific\ntranche, market convention prepayment speeds\nand benchmark yield curves as described above.\n\nCorporate and other debt securities: These\nsecurities consist primarily of corporate\nbonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds\nare senior and subordinated debt obligations\nof domestic corporations. The Company acquires\ncommercial paper that is generally short-term\nin nature and highly rated. These securities\nare valued based on a review of quoted market\nprices for similar assets as well as through\nthe various other inputs discussed previously.\n\nLHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are\noriginated to be sold to investors are carried\nat fair value. The fair value is primarily\nbased on quoted market prices for securities\nbacked by similar types of loans, adjusted for\nservicing, interest rate risk, and credit\nrisk. The changes in fair value of these\nassets are largely driven by changes in\ninterest rates subsequent to loan funding and\nchanges in the fair value of servicing\nassociated with the mortgage LHFS.\n\nLoans and leases: Fair values for loans are\nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology\nthat considered credit loss expectations,\nmarket interest rates, and other market\nfactors such as liquidity from the perspective\nof a market participant. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default, and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninter nal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate was\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof each loan. The discount rates used for\nloans are based on current market rates for\nnew originations of comparable loans and\ninclude adjustments for liquidity.\n\nLoan servicing rights: Residential MSRs are\nvalued using an OAS valuation model to project\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios and then are discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified\nservicing fees, prepayment assumptions,\ndelinquency rates, late charges, other\nancillary revenue, costs to service and other\neconomic factors. Fair value estimates and\nassumptions are compared to industry surveys,\nrecent market activity, actual portfolio\nexperience and other observable market data.\nCommercial MSRs and other loan servicing\nrights are valued using a cash flow valuation\nmodel that calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows. The\nCompany considers actual and expected loan\nprepayment rates, discount rates, servicing\ncosts, and other economic factors that are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nadditional information on valuation techniques\nand inputs for loan servicing rights.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities: The Company\nholds derivative instruments for both trading\nand risk management purposes. These include\nexchange-traded futures or option contracts,\nOTC swaps, options, forwards, and interest\nrate lock commitments. The fair values of\nderivatives are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable assumptions for interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit.\nThe fair values of interest rate lock\ncommitments, which are related to mortgage\nloan commitments and are categorized as Level\n3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted\nfor commitments that are not expected to fund\nand include the value attributable to the net\nservicing fees. Funding rates are based on the\nCompany\u2019s historical data. The fair value\nattributable to servicing is based on\ndiscounted cash flows, and is impacted by\nprepayment assumptions, discount rates,\ndelinquency rates, contractually specified\nservicing fees, servicing costs, and\nunderlying portfolio characteristics.\n\n142 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nEquity securities: Equity securities primarily\nconsist of exchange-traded securities and are\nvalued using quoted prices in active markets.\n\nPrivate equity investments: In many cases\nthere are no observable market values for\nthese investments, and therefore, management\nmust estimate the fair value based on a\ncomparison of the operating performance of the\ninvestee to multiples in the marketplace for\nsimilar entities. This analysis requires\nsignificant judgment, and actual values in a\nsale could differ materially from those\nestimated.\n\nSecurities sold short: Securities sold short\nrepresent debt securities sold short that are\nentered into as a hedging strategy for the\npurposes of supporting institutional and\nretail client trading activities. The fair\nvalue of securities sold short is determined\nin the same manner as trading securities.\nActivity for Level 3 assets and liabilities is\nsummarized below:\n

The remainder of LHFS is carried at fair\nvalue.\n\nLoans and leases consist of larger commercial\nloans and leases that are collateral-dependent\nand other secured loans and leases that have\nbeen charged-off to the fair value of the\ncollateral. Valuation adjustments for loans\nand leases are primarily recorded in the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Refer to\n\u201cNote 1.

ROU assets are measured based on\nthe fair value of the assets, which considers\nthe potential for sublease income. The\nremaining assets are measured at LOCOM, less\ncosts to sell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

Instruments\n\nAs part of the Company\u2019s corporate and\ninvestment banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At December 31,\n2023, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 14 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

These segments have been realigned for\n2024 as described below. The Company\u2019s\nbusiness segment structure is based on the\nmanner in which financial information is\nevaluated by management as well as the\nproducts and services provided or the type of\nclient served.\n\nIn conjunction with the Company\u2019s April 3,\n2023 sale of a 20% stake of the common equity\nin TIH, TIH issued $ 5.0billion of 8.25%\nmandatorily redeemable preferred units to the\nCompany, with the related interest expense,\nwhich is fully allocable to the Company,\nreported in Net intersegment interest income\n(expense). TIH is the principal legal entity\nof the IH segment.\n\nAlso related to the same transaction, TIH\nrecapitalized from a corporate entity to an\nLLC, such that each partner is allocated its\nshare of TIH\u2019s income before taxes, and\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2023 the\nCompany recognizes its associated income tax\nprovision through OT&C. The Company elected\nnot to restate prior periods for this change\nbased on TIH\u2019s previous status as a corporate\nentity. The Company recognized $ 110million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 of tax\nprovision related to IH in OT&C. IH continues\nto recognize taxes for certain state\njurisdictions that impose income taxes on\npartnerships and LLCs.\n\nConsumer Banking and Wealth\n\nThe CB&W segment is made up of two primary\nbusinesses:\n\n\u2022 Consumer & Small Business Banking provides\nbanking, borrowing, investing, insurance\nsolutions, and advice through Retail Banking,\nPremier Banking, and Small Business Banking to\nindividuals and small business clients through\nan extensive network of branches and ATMs,\ndigital channels, and contact centers.\nFinancial products and services offered\ninclude deposits and payments, credit cards,\nloans, mortgages, brokerage and investment\nadvisory services and insurance solutions.\nConsumer and Small Business Banking also\nserves as an entry point for clients and\nservices for other businesses. It includes\nIndirect Lending Services, providing a\ncomprehensive set of technology-enabled\nconsumer lending solutions including point-of-\nsale offerings through Sheffield, Service\nFinance, Recreational Lending, and Dealer\nRetail Services. It also includes Mortgage\nBanking, which offers residential mortgage\nproducts nationally through its retail and\ncorrespondent channels, digital and by\ntelephone. These products are either sold in\nthe secondary market, typically with servicing\nrights retained, or held in the Company\u2019s loan\nportfolio. Mortgage Banking services loans\nheld in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio as well\nas those held by third-party investors.\nMortgage also includes Mortgage Warehouse\nLending, which provides short-term lending\nsolutions to finance first-lien residential\nmortgage LHFS by independent mortgage\ncompanies.\n\n\u2022 Wealth provides a full array of wealth\nmanagement and banking products and\nprofessional services to individuals and\ninstitutional clients, including trust,\nbrokerage, professional investment advisory,\nbusiness transition advice, loans and deposits\nservices to clients seeking active management\nof their financial resources.

It also provides small business\nand corporate services, such as workers\ncompensation and professional liability, as\nwell as surety coverage and title insurance.\n\nOther, Treasury & Corporate\n\nOT&C includes management of the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, long-term\ndebt, derivative instruments used for balance\nsheet hedging, short-term liquidity and\nfunding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement and most real estate assets, as\nwell as the Company\u2019s functional activities\nsuch as finance, enterprise risk, legal,\nenterprise technology and management, among\nothers. Additionally, OT&C houses intercompany\neliminations, including intersegment net\nreferral fees and residual interest rate risk\nafter segment allocations have taken place.\n\nTruist emphasizes revenue growth through the\nCompany\u2019s Integrated Relationship Management\napproach, which is designed to deepen client\nrelationships and bring the full breadth and\ndepth of Truist\u2019s products and services to\nmeet clients\u2019 financial needs. The objective\nis to provide Truist\u2019s entire suite of\nproducts to its clients with the end goal of\nproviding clients the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. To promote\nrevenue growth, revenues of certain products\nand services are reflected in the results of\nthe segment providing those products and\nservices and are also allocated to CB&W and\nC&CB. These allocated revenues between\nsegments are reflected as net referral fees in\nnoninterest income and eliminated in OT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include, but are not limited to,\nthe items as detailed below.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 151\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax\nequivalent basis, related primarily to certain\ncommunity development investments. Recoveries\nfor these allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. When significant changes to\nmanagement reporting methodologies take place,\nthe impact of these changes is quantified and\nprior period information is revised.\n\nSegment Realignment\n\nEffective January 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned within the segments.\nFirst, the CB&W segment was renamed Consumer\nand Small Business Banking and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed Wholesale Banking. Second,\nthe Wealth business was repositioned into a\ncomponent of the Wholesale Banking segment\nfrom the CB&W segment. Third, certain small\nbusiness banking functions were repositioned\ninto a component of the Consumer and Small\nBusiness Banking segment from the C&CB\nsegment. The following table presents segment\nresults prior to the realignment.\n\n152 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 153\n                                              \n  NOTE 22.

The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP. Truist\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that (1) pertain\nto the maintenance of records, that in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and disposition of\nthe Company\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit the preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP\nand that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with\nthe authorizations of Truist\u2019s management and\ndirectors; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material impact on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate due to changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies and procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the\nparticipation of management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer, the Company conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the\ninternal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission, commonly referred to as\nthe \u201cCOSO\u201d criteria. Based on this evaluation\nunder the COSO criteria, management concluded\nthat the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated\nin their accompanying report, which expresses\nan unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes\nin Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this\nreport, the management of the Company, under\nthe supervision and with the participation of\nthe Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, carried out an\nevaluation of the Company\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that the\nCompany\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective.\n\nThere was no change in the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the fourth quarter of 2023 that has\nmaterially affected, or is likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 9B.
