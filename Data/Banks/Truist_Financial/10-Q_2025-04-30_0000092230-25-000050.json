These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company\nupdated its accounting policies in connection\nwith recently adopted accounting standards, as\napplicable, which are described in this\nfootnote. There were no other significant\nchanges to the Company\u2019s accounting policies\nfrom those disclosed in the Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024\nthat could have a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, trading assets and liabilities, and\nderivative assets and liabilities; goodwill\nand other intangible assets; income taxes; and\npension and postretirement benefit\nobligations.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Standards\nThe following table provides a summary of\nsignificant accounting standards not yet\nadopted:\n                                              \n  Standard /                    Effects on    \n  Adoption       Description    the           \n  Date                          Financial     \n                                Statements    \n  Standards                                   \n  Not Yet                                     \n  Adopted                                     \n                 Improves                     \n                 the                          \n                 transparen\u2026                  \n                 of income                    \n                 tax                          \n                 disclosures                  \n                 by                           \n                 requiring                    \n                 (1)                          \n                 consistent                   \n                 categories     Truist is     \n                 and greater    evaluating    \n                 disaggrega\u2026    the impact    \n  Improvemen\u2026    of             of this       \n  to Income      information    standard on   \n  Tax            in the rate    its           \n  Disclosures    reconcilia\u2026    disclosures.  \n  /              and (2)        This          \n  December       income         standard      \n  31, 2025       taxes paid     relates to    \n                 disaggrega\u2026    footnote      \n                 by             disclosures   \n                 jurisdicti\u2026    only.         \n                 It also                      \n                 includes                     \n                 certain                      \n                 other                        \n                 amendments                   \n                 to improve                   \n                 the                          \n                 effectiven\u2026                  \n                 of income                    \n                 tax                          \n                 disclosure\u2026                  \n                 Introduces                   \n                 new                          \n                 requiremen\u2026                  \n                 to disclose                  \n                 additional                   \n                 information                  \n                 about                        \n                 certain                      \n                 types of                     \n                 expenses,                    \n                 including      Truist is     \n                 employee       evaluating    \n                 compensati\u2026    the impact    \n  Expense        depreciati\u2026    of this       \n  Disaggrega\u2026    intangible     standard on   \n  Disclosures    asset          its           \n  /              amortizati\u2026    disclosures.  \n  December       and selling    This          \n  31, 2027       expenses.      standard      \n                 Banks that     relates to    \n                 present a      footnote      \n                 caption for    disclosures   \n                 salaries       only.         \n                 and                          \n                 benefits                     \n                 under SEC                    \n                 rules would                  \n                 be                           \n                 permitted                    \n                 to retain                    \n                 their                        \n                 current                      \n                 definition.                  \n                                              \n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\n                                              \n  NOTE 2.

The\nCompany borrows securities and purchases\nsecurities under agreements to resell as part\nof its securities financing activities. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and the related counterparty agree on\nthe amount of collateral required to secure\nthe principal amount loaned under these\narrangements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements.\nFor securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, the Company would be obligated to\nprovide additional collateral in the event of\na significant decline in fair value of the\ncollateral pledged. This risk is managed by\nmonitoring the liquidity and credit quality of\nthe collateral, as well as the maturity\nprofile of the transactions. Refer to \u201cNote\n14.

increased $ 7million, and\nthe consumer and credit card ALLL increased $\n6million in the three months ended March 31,\n2025. The increase in total ALLL reflects an\nincrease in loan volume with a generally\nstable reserve rate that considers uncertainty\nin the economic outlook. The increase in\ncommercial ALLL reflects an increase in\ncommercial loan balances and an increase in\nreserve rates primarily in commercial\nconstruction. The increase in consumer and\ncredit card ALLL was primarily driven by loan\ngrowth with an increase in the reserve rate in\nresidential real estate, partially offset by a\ndecrease in volume and reserves in certain\nconsumer non-real-estate portfolios.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include\nunemployment trends, U.S. real GDP, corporate\ncredit spreads, property values, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the March 31, 2025 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2024. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, the\neconomic outlook showed signs of deterioration\ncompared to the prior quarter, primarily\nrelated to potential impacts of tariffs and\nincreases to inflation. Risks, including\ntariff and inflation-related uncertainty not\nfully captured by the quantitative models and\nscenario weightings, are incrementally\nreflected in the qualitative component. The\neconomic forecast shaping the quantitative\nmodel outcomes of the ACL estimate as of March\n31, 2025 included low, single-digit GDP growth\nand a mid-to-high single-digit unemployment\nrate.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 17\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s judgment related to\nexpected future credit losses, will continue\nto be an important component of the ACL for\nthe foreseeable future. The March 31, 2025 ACL\nestimate includes adjustments to consider the\nimpact of current and expected events or risks\nnot captured by the loss forecasting models,\nthe outcomes of which are uncertain and may\nnot be completely considered by quantitative\nmodels.

Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of March 31,\n2025.\n\nThe Company most recently performed its annual\ngoodwill impairment test for its CSBB, WB, and\nWealth reporting units as of October 1, 2024.\nBased on the results of the quantitative\nanalyses, the Company concluded that the fair\nvalues of the CSBB, WB and Wealth reporting\nunits exceeded their respective carrying\nvalues; therefore, there was no goodwill\nimpairment. However, for the WB reporting\nunit, the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value by approximately\n10%, indicating that the goodwill of the WB\nreporting unit may remain at risk of\nimpairment. The fair values of the CSBB, WB,\nand Wealth reporting units were estimated\nusing the income approach and a market-based\napproach, each weighted 50%.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill\nattributable to operating segments are\nreflected in the table below. Activity during\n2024 primarily relates to the segment\nrealignment and the divestiture of Sterling\nCapital Management, LLC.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The\nCompany financially supports the VIE\u2019s\npurchases of the reference assets. Reference\nassets are typically fixed income instruments\nprimarily composed of syndicated bank loans.\nThe TRS contracts pass through interest and\nother cash flows on the reference assets to\nthe third-party clients, along with exposing\nthose clients to decreases in value on the\nreference assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the reference\nassets. The terms of the TRS contracts require\nthe third-party clients to post initial margin\ncollateral, as well as ongoing variation\nmargin as the fair values of the underlying\nreference assets change. The following table\nprovides a summary of the TRS transactions\nwith the associated VIE reference assets,\nwhich include trading loans and bonds:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Mar 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2025            2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  VIE          $       2,257    $      1,854  \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  loans and            1,962           1,473  \n  bonds                                       \n  VIE                    465             356  \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n                                              \nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, which could potentially be\nsignificant. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets, and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts.\n\nPledged Assets\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

The legal proceedings and other\nmatters may be formal or informal and include\nlitigation and arbitration with one or more\nidentified claimants, certified or purported\nclass actions with yet-to-be-identified\nclaimants, and regulatory or other\ngovernmental information-gathering requests,\nexaminations, investigations, and enforcement\nproceedings. Claims may be based in law or\nequity\u2014such as those arising under contracts\nor in tort and those involving banking,\nconsumer-protection, securities, antitrust,\ntax, employment, and other laws\u2014and some\npresent novel legal theories, allegations of\nsubstantial or indeterminate damages, demands\nfor injunctive or similar relief, and requests\nfor fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in Truist\u2019s business practices.\nOur legal proceedings and other matters exist\nin varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, negotiation, or investigation and\nspan our business lines and operations.\n\nThe course and outcome of legal proceedings\nand other matters are inherently\nunpredictable. This is especially so when a\nmatter is still in its early stages, the\ndamages sought are indeterminate or\nunsupported, significant facts are unclear or\ndisputed, novel questions of law or other\nmeaningful legal uncertainties exist, a\nrequest to certify a proceeding as a class\naction is outstanding or granted, multiple\nparties are named, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental entities are involved. As a\nresult, we often are unable to determine how\nor when actual or threatened legal proceedings\nand other matters will be resolved and what\nlosses may be incrementally and ultimately\nincurred. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including the\nmatter described below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nTruist establishes accruals for legal\nproceedings and other matters when potential\nlosses become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. Accruals are\nevaluated each quarter and may be adjusted,\nupward or downward, based on our best judgment\nafter consultation with counsel and others. No\nassurance exists that our accruals will not\nneed to be adjusted in the future. Actual\nlosses may be higher or lower than any amounts\naccrued, possibly to a significant degree.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 375million as of March 31,\n2025. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company judged the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nmay change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses, like accruals, are based upon\ncurrently available information and involve\nconsiderable uncertainties and judgment.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the matter\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. These matters are\nnot accrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of a legal\nproceeding in which Truist is involved:\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\nThis class action case was filed in Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint\nasserts claims for violations of civil and\ncriminal usury laws, conversion, and money had\nand received, and seeks damages on a class-\nwide basis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nclass seeks a return of up to $ 452million in\npaid overdraft fees from the 2006 to 2017\nperiod above, plus prejudgment interest which,\nbased on the amount of claimed fees, was\nestimated to be approximately $ 439million as\nof March 31, 2025. A court-ordered mediation\nwas held on February 28, 2024, but no\nresolution was reached. On March 4, 2024, the\ntrial court issued an order granting in part\nand denying in part Truist\u2019s motions to amend\nthe class definition to narrow the scope of\nthe class, to compel arbitration against\ncertain class members, and for summary\njudgment. Truist and the class separately\nappealed the trial court\u2019s order to the\nGeorgia Court of Appeals.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, the Court of Appeals\nruled on the appeals and affirmed in part and\nreversed in part the trial court\u2019s March 4,\n2024 order. Truist and the class filed motions\nto reconsider with the Court of Appeals, which\nwere denied on March 19, 2025. On April 8,\n2025, Truist filed a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari with the Georgia Supreme Court,\nwhich remains pending. The class did not seek\nsuch a writ, and therefore, the rulings by the\nCourt of Appeals in favor of Truist are final.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales, or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience, and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

Corporation\nCredit Derivative Instruments\nAs part of the Company\u2019s investment banking\nand capital market business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At March 31, 2025,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one\nyearto 10years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest rate\nderivative risk participation agreements and\ntotal return swaps:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Mar 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2025            2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk                                        \n  particip\u2026                                   \n  agreemen\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  potential    $         374    $        381  \n  amount of                                   \n  exposure                                    \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  Cash                                        \n  received                                    \n  for                     37              25  \n  variation                                   \n  margin                                      \n  Cash and                                    \n  other                                       \n  collater\u2026                                   \n  received               402             329  \n  for                                         \n  initial                                     \n  margin                                      \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 41\n                                              \n  NOTE 17.

The CODM regularly reviews\nsegment net income and its significant\ncomponents in comparison to expected results\nas part of evaluating segment performance and\noptimizing resource allocation. In this\nregular review, segment net income typically\nexcludes amortization of intangibles,\nrestructuring charges, and goodwill impairment\nwhich are separately presented in the table\nbelow.\nConsumer and Small Business Banking\nCSBB serves retail, premier, and small\nbusiness clients, providing checking, money\nmarket, savings, time and other deposits,\npayment services, and lending solutions\nthrough digital banking, an extensive network\nof community banking branches, ATMs, virtual\nservice centers, and other channels. Lending\nsolutions include credit cards, personal and\nunsecured loans originated through the branch\nnetwork and digital channels; national\nindirect lending services providing a\ncomprehensive set of technology-enabled\nconsumer lending solutions, including point-\nof-sale offerings for autos, recreational\nvehicles, outdoor power sports, outdoor power\nequipment, and home improvement; and real\nestate lending providing residential mortgages\nthrough retail, direct, and correspondent\nchannels, and home equity loans delivered\nthrough the branch network.\nWholesale Banking\nWB provides a comprehensive set of products,\nsolutions, and advisory services to\ncommercial, corporate, institutional, and\nwealth clients. Banking expertise and product\ncapabilities are delivered through a\ncombination of regional coverage across the\nTruist footprint and national industry\ncoverage for real estate, investment banking,\nand capital markets clients. WB works with\nclients to meet their core banking needs,\nincluding traditional and specialized credit\nsolutions and commercial payments to manage\ndeposits and liquidity, payables, and\nreceivables. Through investment banking\ncapabilities, clients have full access to\nstrategic advisory services, debt and equity\ncapital markets, leveraged finance, and\nsecuritizations, with distribution channels\nand market making across both fixed income and\nequity markets. WB also invests in certain\naffordable housing, New Market Tax Credit, and\nrenewable energy tax credit investments. For\nadditional information on these investments,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d.\nThe wealth business delivers asset management,\ntrust, brokerage, and investment management,\nas well as specialized commercial products,\nwhile aligning closely with regional and\nindustry banking coverage.\nOther, Treasury & Corporate\nOT&C includes management of the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, long-term\ndebt, derivative instruments used for balance\nsheet hedging, short-term liquidity and\nfunding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement and most bank-owned real estate\nassets, as well as the Company\u2019s functional\nactivities such as finance, enterprise risk,\nlegal, and enterprise technology and\nmanagement, among others. Additionally, OT&C\nhouses intersegment eliminations, including\nintersegment net referral fees and residual\ninterest rate risk.\n\nTruist promotes revenue growth by bringing the\nfull breadth and depth of Truist\u2019s products\nand services to meet clients\u2019 financial needs.\nThe objective is to deepen client\nrelationships and deliver the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. Revenues of\ncertain products and services are reflected in\nthe results of the segment providing those\nproducts and services and are also allocated\nto CSBB and WB. These allocated revenues\nbetween segments are reflected as net referral\nfees in noninterest income and eliminated in\nOT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support Truist\u2019s strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby other financial institutions. Additionally,\nbecause of the interrelationships between the\nvarious segments, the information presented is\nnot indicative of how the segments would\nperform if they operated as independent\nentities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include the items as detailed\nbelow.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 43\nIn the first quarter of 2025, deposit interest\nexpense methodology was enhanced to reflect a\nchange to funds transfer pricing. Prior period\nresults have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent allocation methodology. As a result of\nthis methodology change, CSBB net interest\nincome decreased $ 133million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, with an off-\nsetting increase in OT&C net interest income.\nFor the same reason, WB net interest income\ndecreased $ 49million for the three months\nended March 31,2024, with an off-setting\nincrease in OT&C net interest income.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up for the WB\nsegment on a pre-tax equivalent basis, related\nprimarily to certain community development\ninvestments. Recoveries for these allocations\nare reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. When significant changes to\nmanagement reporting methodologies take place,\nthe impact of these changes is quantified, and\nprior period information is revised as\npracticable.\n\n44 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) As described above, includes the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, most long-\nterm debt, derivative instruments used for\nbalance sheet hedging, short-term liquidity\nand funding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement, most bank-owned real estate\nassets, as well as functional activities such\nas finance, enterprise risk, legal, and\nenterprise technology and management.\nAdditionally, houses intersegment\neliminations, including for residual interest\nrate risk, intersegment net referral fees, and\nexpense allocations.

This update does not\nsummarize all actual, proposed, or possible\nchanges in statutes, regulations, and other\nlaws applicable to Truist and is not intended\nto be a substitute for those laws. Refer to\n\u201cRegulatory and Supervisory Considerations\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024 for additional\ndisclosures.\n\nIn December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule\nto financial institutions with more than $10\nbillion in assets to either limit the cost of\noverdraft services to the amount of their\ncosts and losses or adhere to a fee cap of $5.\nThe rule was expected to take effect on\nOctober 1, 2025. In late March and early April\n2025, the Senate and House of Representatives\ninvoked the Congressional Review Act to\noverturn this rule. If the resolution is\nsigned by the President, the rule will not\nbecome effective and banks with more than $10\nbillion in assets, including Truist Bank, will\nnot be required to change their overdraft fee\nstructures to comply with the rule.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nWe delivered solid first quarter results as we\nfocused on executing strategic growth\ninitiatives amidst market volatility. We grew\naverage loans and deposits on a linked-quarter\nbasis while delivering strong asset quality\nmetrics and maintaining credit and risk\ndiscipline.\n\nWe prudently managed expenses yet continued to\ninvest in talent, technology, and risk\ninfrastructure. Our strong capital and\nliquidity profile positioned us for a variety\nof economic environments and enabled us to\ncontinue capitalizing on opportunities for our\nshareholders.\n\nWe returned $1.2 billion of capital to our\ncommon shareholders through $679 million of\ncommon stock dividends and $500 million of\ncommon share repurchases during the first\nquarter of 2025. As of March 31, 2025, we had\n$3.5 billion remaining under our $5.0 billion\ncommon share repurchase authorization through\nthe end of 2026.\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet income available to common shareholders\nfor the first quarter of 2025 of $1.2 billion\nwas up 6.0% compared with the first quarter of\n2024. On a diluted per common share basis,\nearnings for the first quarter of 2025 were\n$0.87, an increase of $0.06, or 7.4%, compared\nto the first quarter of 2024. Truist\u2019s results\nof operations for the first quarter of 2025\nproduced an annualized return on average\nassets of 0.96% and an annualized return on\naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity of 8.1%\ncompared to prior year returns of 0.91% and\n8.4%, respectively.\n\nNet income from continuing operations was $1.3\nbillion for the first quarter of 2025,\ncompared to $1.1 billion for the first quarter\nof 2024.\n\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nfirst quarter of 2025 was up $130 million, or\n3.8%, compared to the first quarter of 2024\nprimarily due to the balance sheet\nrepositioning in the second quarter of 2024.\nNet interest margin was 3.01%, up 13 basis\npoints.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 5.97%, down 41 basis points due\nto the impact of variable rate loans\nrepricing. The yield on the average securities\nportfolio was 3.16%, up 71 basis points,\nreflecting the aforementioned balance sheet\nrepositioning and reinvesting cash flows into\nhigher yielding securities.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was\n1.79%, down 24 basis points. The average cost\nof short-term borrowings was 4.49%, down 113\nbasis points. The average cost of long-term\ndebt was 5.05%, up 31 basis points.\n\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of\n2025 was down $54 million, or 3.7%, compared\nto the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to\nlower investment banking and trading income\nand wealth management income.\n\n46 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of\n2025 was down $47 million, or 1.6%, compared\nto the first quarter of 2024 due to lower\nregulatory costs driven by the prior period\nFDIC special assessment adjustment of $75\nmillion and lower personnel expense, partially\noffset by higher professional fees and outside\nprocessing expense. Restructuring charges for\nboth quarters include severance charges as\nwell as costs associated with facilities\noptimization initiatives. Adjusted noninterest\nexpense, which excludes the FDIC special\nassessment adjustment and restructuring\ncharges, increased $41 million, or 1.5%,\ncompared to the earlier quarter.\n\nThe higher effective tax rate for the first\nquarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter\nof 2024 is primarily due to higher forecasted\n2025 pre-tax earnings, partially offset by\nlower discrete tax expense.\n\nAsset quality remained strong during the first\nquarter of 2025.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment were 0.48% of loans and leases held\nfor investment at March 31, 2025, up one basis\npoints compared to December 31, 2024.\n\n\u2022 Loans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing totaled $616 million at March 31,\n2025, up one basis point as a percentage of\nloans and leases compared with December 31,\n2024. Excluding government guaranteed loans,\nthe ratio of loans 90 days or more past due\nand still accruing as a percentage of loans\nand leases was 0.05% at March 31, 2025,\nunchanged from December 31, 2024.\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses was $5.2\nbillion and included $4.9 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $296\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.58%, down\none basis point from December 31, 2024.\n\n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $458\nmillion compared to $500 million for the first\nquarter of 2024.\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off ratio was 60 basis\npoints, down 4 basis points compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2024 primarily driven by\nlower net charge-offs in the CRE portfolio.\n\nCapital ratios remained strong during the\nfirst quarter of 2025.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s CET1 ratio was 11.3% as of March\n31, 2025, down 20 basis points compared to\nDecember 31, 2024 due to capital returned to\nshareholders, an increase in risk-weighted\nassets, and the final CECL phase-in, partially\noffset by current quarter earnings.\n\n\u2022 Truist declared common dividends of $0.52\nper share during the first quarter of 2025 and\nrepurchased $500 million of common stock. For\nthe first quarter of 2025, the dividend payout\nratio was 59%, and the total payout ratio was\n102%.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s average consolidated LCR was 111%\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2025,\ncompared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nfirst quarter of 2025 was up $130 million, or\n3.8%, compared to the first quarter of 2024\nprimarily due to the balance sheet\nrepositioning in the second quarter of 2024.\nNet interest margin was 3.01%, up 13 basis\npoints.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets decreased $283\nmillion, or 0.1%, primarily due to a decline\nin average total loans of $1.9 billion, or\n0.6%, and a decrease in average securities of\n$7.6 billion, or 5.8%, partially offset by\ngrowth in other earning assets of $8.4\nbillion, or 28%. The decrease in average\nsecurities and increase in average other\nearning assets primarily reflects the\naforementioned balance sheet repositioning.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 5.97%, down 41 basis points due\nto the impact of variable rate loans\nrepricing.

When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted.

As of March 31, 2025, Truist held or\nserviced the first lien on 33% of its second\nlien positions.\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 15:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Mar 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2025            2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other    $       9,495    $      9,303  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life                 7,826           7,801  \n  insurance                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension              7,310           7,238  \n  assets                                      \n  Accounts             2,241           1,904  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Accrued              2,053           2,069  \n  income                                      \n  DTAs, net            1,574           1,945  \n  Leased                                      \n  assets                                      \n  and                  1,474           1,352  \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  Prepaid              1,105           1,061  \n  expenses                                    \n  Derivati\u2026            1,056             966  \n  assets                                      \n  ROU                    992           1,015  \n  assets                                      \n  FHLB                   922             965  \n  stock                                       \n  Other                  868           1,513  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $      36,916    $     37,132  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 61\n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026       J\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \nAverage deposits for the first quarter of 2025\nwere $392.2 billion, an increase of $2.2\nbillion, or 0.6%, compared to the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n1.9% compared to the prior quarter and\nrepresented 27.0% of total deposits for the\nfirst quarter of 2025 compared to 27.7% for\nthe fourth quarter of 2024.

A key objective of the Company\u2019s\nrisk management framework is to promote the\nexecution of strategic goals and objectives in\nalignment with its risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed a risk management\ntaxonomy to provide for the identification and\nclassification of risk elements at Truist. The\nobjective of the risk management taxonomy is\nto define enterprise-wide categorization for\nelements used in risk management activities,\nestablish consistently applied language, and\nenable data analysis, aggregation, and\nreporting.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports the identification and\nescalation of risks across the organization.\nAll teammates are responsible for upholding\nthe Company\u2019s purpose, mission, and values,\nand are encouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics influences the Company\u2019s decision\nmaking and informs teammates on how to act in\nthe absence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities must be evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in interest rates,\nspreads, or prices of financial instruments,\nand the corresponding impact on the\ncomposition of the balance sheet or trading\nand fair value positions. Market risk results\nfrom changes in the level, volatility, or\ncorrelations among financial market risk\nfactors or prices, including interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates,\nequity, and commodity prices.\n\nTruist\u2019s most significant market risk exposure\nis to interest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk of instruments held in\nTruist\u2019s business units. Interest rate risk\nresults from: differences between the timing\nof rate changes and the timing of cash flows\nassociated with assets and liabilities (re-\npricing risk); changing rate relationships\namong different yield curves affecting bank\nactivities (basis risk); changing rate\nrelationships across the spectrum of\nmaturities (yield curve risk); and interest-\nrelated options inherently embedded in bank\nproducts (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of market risk\nmanagement are to minimize adverse effects\nfrom changes in market risk factors on net\ninterest income, net income, and capital, and\nto offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTruist primarily monitors this risk through\ntwo measurement types, (i) NII at risk and\n(ii) economic value of equity. Truist manages\nthis risk with securities, derivatives, and\nbroader asset liability management activities.\nTruist uses derivatives to hedge interest\nincome variability of floating rate loans and\nto hedge valuation changes of long-term debt\nand investment securities.\n\nIRR measurement is reported monthly through\nthe ALCO. Monthly IRR reporting includes\nexposure and historical trends relative to\nrisk limit scenarios, impacts to a wide range\nof rate scenarios, and sensitivity tests of\nkey assumptions. IRR reporting is provided to\nthe BRC quarterly.\nIRR measurement is influenced by data,\nassumptions, and models. Due to their high\nsensitivity to market rates, mortgage (loan\nand security) prepayments leverage an industry\nmodel that results in varying prepayment\nspeeds across rate scenarios. Prepayments for\nnon-mortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic\nmodels (varying results based on market rates)\nand static prepayment assumptions based on\nhistorical experience. Our analysis\nincorporates dynamic client deposit balance\nlevels, the mix across product types, and\ndeposit rate paid across alternate rate\nscenarios based on modeled changes in client\nand bank behavior. The use of dynamic deposit\nbalance models results in rotation to higher\ncost funding products (e.g., CDs) when market\nrates increase and to lower cost funding\nproducts (e.g., non-maturity deposits) when\nmarket rates decrease. The use of dynamic rate\npaid models results in varying deposit betas\nbased on the timing and conditions within\nmarket rate cycles.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nNII at risk measures the change in NII under\nalternate interest rate scenarios relative to\nTruist\u2019s baseline scenario, which incorporates\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges as well as expectations for new\nbusiness over the forecast horizon. Truist\u2019s\nbaseline scenario relies on assumptions\nincluding expectations of the economy and\ninterest rates \u2013 which are influenced by\nmarket conditions, new business volume,\npricing, and client behavior. In measuring NII\nat risk, Truist assumes that changes in key\nfactors, such as prepayments and deposit\npricing (betas), largely move in line with\nthose it has experienced in prior rate cycles.\nHowever, future behavior of key factors may\nvary from Truist\u2019s assumptions. NII at risk\nmeasurement assumes, when applicable, that\nU.S. interest rates floor at zero and Truist\ndoes not take any balance sheet or hedging\nactions in response to the rate scenarios.\n\nTruist evaluates a wide range of alternate\nscenarios including instantaneous and gradual\nas well as parallel and non-parallel changes\nin interest rates. The table below presents\nthe estimated change to NII over the following\n12 months for select parallel alternate\nscenarios, expressed as a percentage change\nrelative to baseline NII.\n                                              \n  Table 18:                                   \n  Interest                                    \n  Sensitiv\u2026                                   \n  Simulati\u2026       Mar 31,         Dec 31,     \n  Analysis           2025            2024     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Up 200bps                                   \n  gradual                                     \n  change in           1.5  %          1.1  %  \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Up 50bps                                    \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  change in           0.6             0.6     \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Down                                        \n  50bps                                       \n  instanta\u2026          -0.8            -0.8     \n  change in                                   \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Down                                        \n  200bps                                      \n  gradual            -2.4            -2.1     \n  change in                                   \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n                                              \nTruist performs and monitors sensitivity tests\nof key assumptions used in NII risk including:\n\n\u2022 Asset prepayment speeds\n\n\u2022 New loan volume pricing spreads\n\n\u2022 Interest-bearing deposit betas\n\n\u2022 Non-interest-bearing demand deposit balance\nrunoff, replaced by market funding\n\nEVE measures changes in the economic value of\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios\nrelative to starting economic value.

Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a multi-faceted risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule,\nwhich were non-agency asset backed securities\npositions, was $170 million. Consistent with\nthe Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company\nperforms pre-purchase due diligence on each\nsecuritization position to identify the\ncharacteristics, including deal structure and\nthe asset quality of the underlying assets,\nthat materially affect valuation and\nperformance. Securitization positions are\nsubject to Truist\u2019s risk management framework,\nwhich includes daily monitoring against a\nsuite of limits. There were no off-balance\nsheet securitization positions during the\nreporting period.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of March 31, 2025.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to manage market risk include\nstress testing, scenario analysis, and stop\nloss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.\n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026            \u2026                          \n      \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n      \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  \n                   \u2026       8       \u2026       \u2026  \n                   9       4       \u2026       8  \n                   \u2026       9       \u2026       9  \n                                              \n                           6               4  \n                           7               3  \n                           7               5  \n                           1               1  \n                           \u2026               \u2026  \n                           9               9  \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended March 31, 2025.\nThe total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are reviewed in the context of VaR\nmodel use and performance. There was no change\nin the capital multiplication factor over the\npreceding twelve months.\n\n66 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision models, including\ntrading market risk models. As part of ongoing\nmonitoring efforts, the performance of all\ntrading risk models is reviewed regularly to\nevaluate model performance with emerging\ndevelopments in financial markets, assess\nevolving modeling approaches, and identify\npotential model enhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a range of stress testing\ntechniques to help monitor risks across\ntrading desks and to augment standard daily\nVaR and other risk limits reporting. The\nstress testing framework is designed to\nquantify the impact of extreme, but plausible,\nstress scenarios that could lead to large,\nunexpected losses. Stress tests include\nsimulations for risk factor sensitivities,\nhistorical repeats, and hypothetical scenarios\nwith varying liquidity horizons of key risk\nfactors. All trading positions within each\napplicable market risk category (i.e.,\ninterest rate risk, equity risk, foreign\nexchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and\ncommodity price risk) are included in the\nCompany\u2019s stress testing framework. Management\nreviews stress testing scenarios and makes\nupdates on an ongoing basis. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in\nassets and meet obligations as they come due,\nall without incurring unacceptable costs. In\naddition to the level of liquid assets, such\nas cash, cash equivalents, and highly liquid\nunencumbered securities, other factors affect\nthe ability to meet liquidity needs, including\naccess to a variety of funding sources,\nmaintaining borrowing capacity, growing core\ndeposits, loan repayment, and the ability to\nsecuritize or package loans for sale.\n\nTruist has a liquidity risk management process\ndesigned to identify, measure, and monitor key\nliquidity risks to assess whether Truist is\noperating within its liquidity risk appetite.\nThe liquidity risk appetite is outlined using\na qualitative statement and more granular\ndetailed risk appetite statements aligned to\nTruist\u2019s risk taxonomy; risk statements form\nthe basis for aligning risk appetite with risk\nmanagement goals and strategy. Using the risk\nappetite statements, key risk indicators are\ndeveloped that represent quantitative metrics\nwhich measure current risk exposure relative\nto Truist\u2019s risk appetite, which help the\nBoard and management monitor liquidity risk\ntaking activity. Truist\u2019s key risk indicators\nare designed to support the following\nobjectives:\n\n\u2022 maintain (i) a diversified, but client\ndeposit centric, funding base, (ii) a level of\nliquid, readily monetized assets sufficient to\nsatisfy business as usual and stressed cash\nflow needs across multiple liquidity horizons,\nand (iii) an appropriate level of contingent\nfunding to meet any unexpected needs;\n\n\u2022 limit concentration risk from individual,\ncorrelated counterparties, and funding\nconcentrations in tenors that may negatively\nimpact Truist from an unforeseen idiosyncratic\nor market event; and\n\n\u2022 maintain sufficient liquidity in the holding\ncompany to serve as a source of strength to\nits subsidiaries.\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\nLiquidity stress testing is conducted for\nTruist and Truist Bank using a variety of\ninstitution-specific and market-wide adverse\nscenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario\napplies defined assumptions to execute sources\nand uses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, increased\ndraws on unfunded commitments, and the\npotential need to post additional collateral\nfor derivatives. To mitigate liquidity\noutflows, Truist has identified sources of\nliquidity; however, access to these sources of\nliquidity could be affected within a stressed\nenvironment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is designed to meet the projected 30-day\nnet stressed cash-flow needs. Truist\u2019s\nliquidity buffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule. Truist periodically monetizes a\nrepresentative sample of the liquidity buffer\nto assess operational readiness through\navailable monetization channels.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 67\nContingency Funding Plan\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto address ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction. On a quarterly basis, Truist\nconducts testing of market access for\nalternative sources of funds (e.g. discount\nwindow, standing repo facility, etc.) to test\noperational readiness. On a periodic basis,\nTruist conducts a table-top test of the\nContingency Funding Plan to assess reliability\nof the plan during liquidity stress events and\nto simulate the operational elements of the\nplan such as communications, coordination, and\ndecision-making.\nLCR, NSFR, and HQLA\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient within the parameters of the\nrule to meet their estimated total net cash\noutflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day\nperiod of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes\nof calculating the LCR, is the amount of\nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $90.0 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 111% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025.\n\nThe NSFR rule defines a minimum amount of\nstable, long-term funding that Truist and\nTruist Bank must maintain in relation to their\nasset composition and off-balance sheet\nactivities. Truist and Truist Bank are subject\nto the Category III reduced NSFR requirements.\nAt March 31, 2025, Truist was compliant with\nthis requirement.\nSources of Funds\nTruist funds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources, including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 21:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Mar 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2025            2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      79,737    $     72,040  \n  FHLB                32,041          31,411  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           76,764          68,212  \n  (at fair                                    \n  value)                                      \n  Available                                   \n  secured            188,542         171,663  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             35,372          33,717  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     223,914    $    205,380  \n                                              \nAt March 31, 2025, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 5.4 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one year or\nless.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\nParent Company\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for its operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock,\npayments on and, from time-to-time, potential\nrepurchases or redemptions of a portion of an\noutstanding tranche of the long-term debt of\nthe Parent Company (as may be permitted by the\nterms of each respective series), and the\nredemption of preferred stock. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist manages cash levels at the\nParent Company to exceed a minimum of 12\nmonths of projected cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At March 31, 2025, the\nParent Company held cash on hand to meet these\nrequirements.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings.\nThe following table presents the credit\nratings and outlooks of the Parent Company and\nTruist Bank as of March 31, 2025:\n                                              \n  Tab\u2026                                        \n  22:                                         \n  Cre\u2026                                        \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Bank                                        \n          Mood\u2026    S&P       Fitch    DBRS    \n                                      Morni\u2026  \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    Baa1     A- /      A /      AAL /   \n                   A-2       F1       R-1M    \n  Sen\u2026    Baa1     A-        A-       AAL     \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Sub\u2026    Baa1     BBB+      BBB+     AH      \n  Pre\u2026    Baa3\u2026    BBB-      BBB-     AL      \n  sto\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Ban\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A3       A /       A /      AA /    \n                   A-1       F1       R-1H    \n  Sen\u2026    A3       A         A        AA      \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Dep\u2026    A1/P\u2026    NA        A+ /     AA      \n                             F1               \n  Sub\u2026    (P)      A-        A-       AAL     \n          A3                                  \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  out\u2026                                        \n  Cre\u2026    Stab\u2026    Stable    Stab\u2026    Stable  \n  tre\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis.

In this regard, management\u2019s\nobjective is to maintain capital at levels\nthat are in excess of internal capital limits,\nwhich are above the regulatory \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d minimums. Truist also regularly\nperforms stress testing on its capital levels\nand is required to periodically submit the\nCompany\u2019s capital plans and stress testing\nresults to the banking regulators.

Repurchased shares revert to the\nstatus of authorized and unissued shares upon\nrepurchase. The share-repurchase program\nenables Truist to acquire shares through open-\nmarket purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1\nplans and other programs, at the discretion of\nmanagement and on terms (including quantity,\ntiming, and price) that management determines\nto be advisable. Actions in connection with\nthe share-repurchase program will be subject\nto various factors, including Truist's capital\nand liquidity positions and related internal\nframeworks, accounting and regulatory\nconsiderations (including any restrictions\nthat may be imposed by the FRB and any changes\nto capital, liquidity, and other regulatory\nrequirements that may be proposed or adopted\nby the U.S. banking agencies), Truist's\nfinancial and operational performance,\nalternative uses of capital, the trading price\nof Truist's common stock, and general market\nconditions. The share-repurchase program does\nnot obligate Truist to acquire a specific\ndollar amount or number of shares and may be\nextended, modified, or discontinued at any\ntime.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Company\nrepurchased $750 million of common stock,\nwhich represented 20.2 million shares, through\nopen market repurchases.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \nThe accounting and reporting policies of\nTruist are in accordance with GAAP and conform\nto the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities.\nTruist\u2019s financial position and results of\noperations are affected by management\u2019s\napplication of accounting policies, including\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments made to\narrive at the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities, and amounts reported for revenues\nand expenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition or consolidated results of\noperations, and related disclosures. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nsecurities, MSRs, trading assets and\nliabilities, and derivative assets and\nliabilities; goodwill and other intangible\nassets; income taxes; and pension and\npostretirement benefit obligations.\nUnderstanding Truist\u2019s accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. The critical accounting policies\nare discussed in MD&A in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024. Significant accounting\npolicies and changes in accounting principles\nand effects of new accounting pronouncements\nare discussed in \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d in Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024. Disclosures regarding the\neffects of new accounting pronouncements are\nincluded in \u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in\nthis report. There have been no other changes\nto the critical accounting policies during\n2025.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s three reporting units with\ngoodwill balances were CSBB, WB, and Wealth.\nThe Company performs goodwill impairment\nanalysis annually as of October 1 or more\noften if events or circumstances indicate that\nit is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is below its carrying\nvalue.\n\nThe quantitative valuations of these reporting\nunits use the income approach and a market-\nbased approach, each weighted at 50%. The\ninputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates, and applicable\nvaluation multiples based on the comparable\npublic company information. The income\napproach utilizes a discounted cash flow\nanalysis of multi-year financial forecasts\ndeveloped for each reporting unit by\nconsidering several inputs and assumptions\nsuch as net interest margin, expected credit\nlosses, noninterest income, noninterest\nexpense, and required capital. The market-\nbased approach utilizes comparable public\ncompany information, key valuation multiples,\nand considers a market control premium\nassociated with cost synergies and other cash\nflow benefits that arise from obtaining\ncontrol over a reporting unit, and guideline\ntransactions, when applicable.\n\nTruist also assesses the reasonableness of the\naggregate estimated fair value of the\nreporting units by comparison to its market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime, including consideration of expected\nacquirer expense synergies, historic bank\ncontrol premiums, and the current market.\n\nThe projection of net interest margin and\nnoninterest expense are the most significant\ninputs to the financial projections of the\nCSBB, WB, and Wealth reporting units. The\nlong-term growth rate used in determining the\nterminal value of each reporting unit was 3%\nas of October 1, 2024, based on management\u2019s\nassessment of the minimum expected terminal\ngrowth rate of each reporting unit. Discount\nrates are estimated based on the Capital Asset\nPricing Model, which considers the risk-free\ninterest rate, market risk premium, beta, and\nunsystematic risk adjustments specific to a\nparticular reporting unit. The discount rates\nare also calibrated based on risks related to\nthe projected cash flows of each reporting\nunit. The discount rates utilized for the\nCSBB, Wealth, and WB reporting units as of\nOctober 1, 2024 were 12.5%, 12.0%, and 10.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nBased on the results of the Company\u2019s annual\nimpairment analyses, the Company concluded\nthat the fair values of the CSBB, WB and\nWealth reporting units exceeded their\nrespective carrying values; therefore, there\nwas no goodwill impairment. However, for the\nWB reporting unit, the fair value of the\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\napproximately 10%, indicating that the\ngoodwill of the WB reporting unit may remain\nat risk of impairment. Circumstances that\ncould negatively impact the fair value for the\nWB reporting unit in the future include a\nsustained decrease in Truist\u2019s stock price, a\ndecline in industry peer multiples, an\nincrease in the applicable discount rate, and\ndeterioration in the reporting unit\u2019s\nforecast.\n\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value. The\nvaluation of the WB reporting unit as of\nOctober 1, 2024 indicated that if the discount\nrate were increased more than 100 basis\npoints, with other cash flow assumptions\nunchanged, the reporting unit\u2019s fair value\nwould be less than its carrying value,\nindicating a goodwill impairment under the\nincome approach. Ultimately, future potential\nchanges in management\u2019s assumptions may impact\nthe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nand cause the fair value of the reporting unit\nto be below its carrying value.
