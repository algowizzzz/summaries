Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company\nupdated its accounting policies in connection\nwith recently adopted accounting standards.\nThere were no other significant changes to the\nCompany\u2019s accounting policies from those\ndisclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 that\ncould have a material effect on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial statements.\nReclassifications\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company\nreclassified certain portfolios within the\nconsumer portfolio segment to delineate home\nequity from other consumer portfolios.\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of\n2023, Truist reorganized Prime Rate Premium\nFinance Corporation, which includes AFCO\nCredit Corporation and CAFO Holding Company,\ninto the C&CB segment from the IH segment.\nPrior periods were revised to conform to the\ncurrent presentation. Certain other amounts\nreported in prior periods\u2019 consolidated\nfinancial statements have been reclassified to\nconform to the current presentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nLoan Modifications\nIn certain circumstances, the Company enters\ninto agreements to modify the terms of loans\nto borrowers that are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The scope of these loan\nmodifications varies from portfolio to\nportfolio but generally falls into one of the\nfollowing categories:\n\u2022 Renewals: represent the renewal of a loan\nwhere the Company has concluded that the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nCommercial renewals result in an extension of\nthe maturity date of the loan (or in some\ncases a contraction of the loan term), and\nother significant terms of the loan (e.g.,\ninterest rate, collateral, guarantor support,\netc.) are re-evaluated in connection with the\nrenewal event.\n\u2022 Term extensions: represent an adjustment to\nthe maturity date of the loan that typically\nresults in a reduction to the borrower\u2019s\nscheduled payment over the remainder of the\nloan.\n\u2022 Capitalizations: represents the\ncapitalization of forborne loan payments\nand/or other amounts advanced on behalf of the\nborrower into the principal balance of a\nresidential mortgage loan.\n\u2022 Payment delays: provide the borrower with a\ntemporary postponement of loan payments that\nis considered other-than-insignificant, which\nhas been defined as a payment delay that\nexceeds 90 days, or three payment cycles, over\na rolling 12-month period. These postponed\nloan payments may result in an extension of\nthe ultimate maturity date of the loan or may\nbe capitalized into the principal balance of\nthe loan in certain circumstances.\n\u2022 Combinations: in certain circumstances more\nthan one type of a modification is provided to\na borrower (e.g., interest rate reduction and\nterm extension).\n\u2022 Other: represents other types of loan\nmodifications that are not considered\nsignificant for disclosure purposes.\nThe Company has identified borrowers that are\nincluded in the Loan Modifications disclosures\nin \u201cNote 5. Loans and ACL\u201d as follows:\n\u2022 Commercial: the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of loans to commercial borrowers\nthat are rated substandard or worse and\nincludes the modifications in its disclosure\nto the extent that the modification is\nconsidered other-than-insignificant.\n\u2022 Consumer and credit card: loan modifications\nto consumer and credit borrowers are generally\nlimited to borrowers that are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. As a result, the Company\nevaluates all modifications of consumer and\ncredit card loans and includes them in the\ndisclosure to the extent that they are\nconsidered other-than insignificant.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nRefer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 for\naccounting policies related to prior period,\nincluding the Company\u2019s TDR policies.\nALLL\nThe ALLL represents management\u2019s best estimate\nof expected future credit losses related to\nits loan and lease portfolio at the balance\nsheet date. The Company\u2019s ALLL estimation\nprocess gives consideration to relevant\navailable information from internal and\nexternal sources relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The quantitative models\nused to forecast expected credit losses use\nportfolio balances, macroeconomic forecast\ndata, portfolio composition and loan\nattributes as the primary inputs. Loss\nestimates are informed by historical loss\nexperience that includes losses incurred on\nloans that were previously modified by the\nCompany. As a result, the Company has\nconcluded that aside from the limited\ncircumstances where principal forgiveness is\ngranted to a borrower, the financial effect of\nloan modifications is already inherently\nincluded in the ALLL.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified tax credit investments. In\ncomputing the provision for income taxes, the\nCompany evaluates the technical merits of its\nincome tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The proportional amortization method\nof accounting is used on affordable housing\nand other qualified tax credit investments,\nsuch that the initial cost of the investment\ngiving rise to tax credits is amortized in\nproportion to the allocation of tax credits in\neach period as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes.

the amounts for the ALLL for PCD\nacquisitions, the impact of adopting the\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures accounting standard, and other\nactivity.\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 156million and\nthe consumer ALLL decreased $ 49million for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023. The\nincrease in the commercial ALLL primarily\nreflects loan growth and increased economic\nuncertainty. The decrease in the consumer ALLL\nwas primarily driven by the impact of the\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures accounting standard, under which\nreasonable expectations of TDRs are no longer\nconsidered, partially offset by increased\neconomic uncertainty. Considerations for the\nincreased economic uncertainty include the\npotential impacts related to the risks\nassociated with inflation, rising rates,\ngeopolitical events, and recession.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nU.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nrental rates, property values, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the March 31, 2023 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2022. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, each\nforecast scenario reflected deterioration in\ncertain economic variables over the reasonable\nand supportable forecast period when compared\nto the prior period. The primary economic\nforecast shaping the ACL estimate at March 31,\n2023 included GDP growth in the low-single\ndigits and an unemployment rate near mid-\nsingle digits.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 17\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The March 31,\n2023 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third-party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases.

Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB.

The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of March 31,\n2023. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. In addition,\nthe matters underlying this estimate will\nchange from time to time. Estimated losses are\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolve considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived, and seeks damages on a class-wide\nbasis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nCompany previously filed a motion to amend the\nclass definition in which it sought to narrow\nthe scope of the class and renewed motions to\ncompel arbitration against certain class\nmembers, which the court found were premature.\nOn September 22, 2022, the trial court entered\na scheduling order holding that the court will\nconsider such motions after discovery, which\nis ongoing, is completed. Trial is presently\nset to commence on April 29, 2024. The Company\ncontinues to believe that the underlying\nclaims are without merit.\n\nUnited Services Automobile Association v.\nTruist Bank\n\nUSAA filed a lawsuit on July 29, 2022 against\nthe Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nalleging that the Company\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringe certain\npatents held by USAA. The complaint seeks\ndamages, including for alleged willful\ninfringement and a corresponding request that\nthe amount of actual damages be trebled, as\nwell as injunctive and other equitable relief.\nThe Company filed its answer and affirmative\ndefenses on October 11, 2022, denying that it\ninfringes any of the patents at issue in the\nlawsuit and asserting that USAA\u2019s patents are\ninvalid or unenforceable. On December 30,\n2022, the Company filed a motion for leave to\namend its answer to assert counterclaims\nseeking damages as well as injunctive relief\nagainst USAA for infringing certain patents\nowned by the Company and practiced by USAA\u2019s\nmobile remote deposit capture systems, which\nmotion was granted on April 8, 2023. On March\n20, 2023, USAA filed a motion for leave to\nfile an amended complaint which would add a\nclaim that the Company\u2019s mobile remote deposit\ncapture systems infringe an additional USAA\npatent. On April 14, 2023, USAA filed a motion\nseeking to sever Truist\u2019s counterclaims from\nthe case. USAA\u2019s motions above are both\npending. Discovery in the district court\nproceedings is ongoing, and trial is presently\nset to commence on March 18, 2024.\n\nAt the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the\nCompany filed separate petitions for inter\npartes review on October 11, November 7, and\nNovember 15, 2022 challenging the validity of\neach of the three patents asserted by USAA in\nthe lawsuit. In addition, on April 13, 2023,\nthe Company filed a petition for inter partes\nreview challenging the validity of the fourth\npatent USAA is seeking to add to the lawsuit.\nIf institution of any of the petitions for\ninter partes review is granted, the Patent\nTrial and Appeal Board will review the\nvalidity of the claims in the applicable\npatent(s).\n               Truist Financial Corporation 29\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

and\ninvestment banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At March 31, 2023,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 15 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14.

Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. The\ndescriptions below summarize updates since the\nfiling of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 to state and\nfederal laws to which Truist is subject. These\ndescriptions do not summarize all possible or\nproposed changes in current laws or\nregulations and are not intended to be a\nsubstitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions. Refer to Truist\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional disclosures.\n\nIn March 2023, the FRB created the Bank Term\nFunding Program to support American businesses\nand households by making additional funding\navailable to eligible depository institutions.\nThis program offers loans up to one year in\nlength to banks, savings associations, credit\nunions, and other eligible depository\ninstitutions pledging any collateral eligible\nfor purchase by the FRB in open market\noperations, such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S.\nagency securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-\nbacked securities. These assets will be valued\nat par.\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent bank failures,\nwe expect that the banking agencies will\npropose certain actions, including reforms\nthat may impose different capital and\nliquidity requirements, including increased\nrequirements to issue long term debt. In\naddition, there may be special assessments to\nrepay losses to the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance\nFund. It is not yet possible to quantify the\nimpact of these potential actions.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nIn a challenging and unique quarter for the\nbanking industry, Truist demonstrated strength\nand leadership that reflects our diverse\nbusiness model, granular and relationship-\noriented deposit base, and strong capital and\nliquidity position. Truist has significant\naccess to liquidity and a very robust\nliquidity management process that includes\ninternal and external stress testing, as well\nas real-time monitoring of our liquidity\nposition. We also closed on the sale of a 20%\nminority stake in Truist Insurance Holdings,\nLLC on April 3, 2023, which provides strategic\nand financial flexibility for both Truist and\nTruist Insurance Holdings.\n\nWe continued to experience the benefits of our\nshift from integrating to operating, including\nimproving organic production and integrated\nrelationship management momentum, although\nthese benefits were offset by higher-than-\nexpected funding costs. Asset quality metrics\nremain strong, and we prudently increased our\nALLL ratio by three basis points to reflect\nincreased economic uncertainty.\n\nOur focus on clients was unwavering during the\nfirst quarter of 2023. Our teammates continue\nto care for our clients and stakeholders and\nlive our purpose to inspire and build better\nlives and communities. Truist continues to be\na source of strength and stability for our\nclients and communities.\n\nTruist made a $1 billion uninsured time\ndeposit in First Republic Bank during the\nfirst quarter joining the nation\u2019s largest\nfinancial intuitions to show support for the\nU.S. banking system and the economy. On\nMonday, May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nNational Association assumed all of the\ndeposits and purchased the substantial\nmajority of assets of First Republic Bank from\nthe FDIC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, National\nAssociation has indicated that the deposit\nTruist made at First Republic Bank will be\nrepaid post-closing of the transaction.\n\nDetailed below are actions that we have taken\nto fulfill our purpose to inspire and build\nbetter lives and communities, followed by a\ndiscussion of our financial results for the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\n\n\u2022 Made meaningful improvement in our client\nexperience, with Voice of the Client metrics\nrising since the second quarter of 2022, and\ncontinued positive momentum with branch\nsatisfaction scores in the first quarter of\n2023\n\n\u2022 Opened T3 Accelerator Lab in the Innovation\n& Technology Center where we\u2019re redefining the\nclient and teammate experience, putting\nfeedback and ideas to the test in real-world\nscenarios before rolling out to clients\n\n40 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 Continued growth for Truist Momentum,\nTruist\u2019s financial wellness program\n\n\u2022 Published 2022 Corporate Responsibility\nReport, TCFD Report, and ESG Disclosure\nSummary, highlighting our progress across\nmultiple dimensions including community,\nfinancial inclusion, DEI, and climate and\nenergy\n\n\u25e6 We made important progress on our\nsustainability commitments through 2022,\nincluding our goal of achieving a 35%\nreduction in both Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions by 2030 from our baseline year of\n2019. We reduced Scope 1 emissions by 17% and\nScope 2 emissions by 26%.\n\n\u2022 Successfully migrated certain consumer and\nsmall business credit cards to a new\nprocessing platform\n\n\u2022 Announced a new goal to increase female and\nethnically diverse representation in\nleadership roles by 15% and 20%, respectively,\nby 2025\n\n\u2022 Committed $282 million from Truist Community\nCapital to support affordable housing and job\ncreation in underserved communities and $22\nmillion through Truist Foundation for a\nmultiyear program to strengthen small\nbusinesses and create career pathways for\nethnically diverse individuals and\nentrepreneurs\n\n\u2022 We are also in the process of realigning our\nLightStream platforms with our broader\nconsumer business, with the goal of bringing\nthe innovation, digital capabilities,\nefficiencies, and certain cloud-based\ninfrastructure of LightStream to the broader\nTruist client base\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet income available to common shareholders\nfor the first quarter of 2023 of $1.4 billion\nwas up 6.3% compared with the first quarter of\n2022. On a diluted per common share basis,\nearnings for the first quarter of 2023 were\n$1.05, an increase of $0.06, or 6.1%, compared\nto the first quarter of 2022. Truist\u2019s results\nof operations for the first quarter of 2023\nproduced an annualized return on average\nassets of 1.10% and an annualized return on\naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity of 10.3%\ncompared to prior year returns of 1.07% and\n9.0%, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Results for the first quarter of 2023\nincluded merger-related and restructuring\ncharges of $63 million ($48 million after-tax,\nor $0.04 per share).\n\n\u2022 Results for the first quarter of 2022\nincluded $216 million ($166 million after-tax,\nor $0.12 per share) of merger-related and\nrestructuring charges, $202 million ($155\nmillion after-tax, or $0.12 per share) of\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger, a gain on the redemption of\nnoncontrolling equity interest of $74 million\n($57 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share)\nrelated to the acquisition of certain merchant\nservices relationships, and net losses on the\nsales of securities of $69 million ($53\nmillion after-tax, or $0.04 per share).\n\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nfirst quarter of 2023 was up $710 million, or\n22%, compared to the first quarter of 2022\nprimarily due to higher short-term interest\nrates and strong loan growth, alongside well\ncontrolled deposit costs. These increases were\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion and PPP revenue. Net interest margin\nwas 3.17%, up 41 basis points.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the total loan portfolio was\n5.81%, up 212 basis points, primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion and PPP revenue. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 2.14%, up 46\nbasis points primarily due to the higher rate\nenvironment. The average cost of total\ndeposits was 1.12%, up 109 basis points.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of short-term borrowings\nwas 4.69%, up 409 basis points. The average\ncost of long-term debt was 4.05%, up 255 basis\npoints. The increase in rates on deposits and\nother funding sources was largely attributable\nto the higher rate environment.\n\nNoninterest income was up $92 million, or\n4.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2022\ndue to 12% growth in insurance income, higher\nmortgage banking income, higher fees from\nlending-related activities and card and\npayment related activities. These items were\npartially offset by lower other income. The\nfirst quarter of 2022 included $69 million of\nsecurities losses and a $74 million gain on\nthe redemption of noncontrolling equity\ninterest (included in other income).\n\nNoninterest expense was up $17 million, or\n0.5%, compared to the first quarter of 2022\ndue to higher personnel expense, other\nexpense, and regulatory costs. These increases\nwere partially offset by lower merger-related\nand restructuring charges and professional\nfees and outside processing expenses. Merger-\nrelated and restructuring charges and\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nmerger decreased $153 million and $202\nmillion, respectively, due to the completion\nof integration-related activities. Adjusted\nnoninterest expenses, which exclude merger-\nrelated costs and the amortization of\nintangibles increased $373 million, or 12%.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $394\nmillion for the first quarter of 2023,\ncompared to $330 million for the earlier\nquarter. The effective tax rate for the first\nquarter of 2023 was 20.6%, compared to 18.9%\nfor the earlier quarter.\n\nAsset quality remains excellent, reflecting\nTruist\u2019s prudent risk culture and diverse\nportfolio. Nonperforming loans and leases held\nfor investment were 0.36% of loans and leases\nheld for investment at March 31, 2023, flat\ncompared to December 31, 2022.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 41\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses was $4.8\nbillion and includes $4.5 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $282\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.37%, up\nthree basis points compared with December 31,\n2022 primarily due to increased economic\nuncertainty.\n\n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $502\nmillion compared to a benefit of $95 million\nfor the first quarter of 2022. The increase in\nthe current quarter provision expense\nprimarily reflects increased economic\nuncertainty in the current period, whereas the\nearlier quarter included a reserve release due\nto the improving credit environment during\nthat period.\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off ratio was 37 basis\npoints, up 12 basis points compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2022 driven by higher charge-\noffs in the indirect auto and other consumer\nportfolios due to normalizing trends, as well\nas an increase in the commercial and\nindustrial portfolio.\n\nCapital and liquidity remained strong compared\nto the regulatory requirements for well\ncapitalized banks.\n\n\u2022 Truist CET1 ratio was 9.1% as of March 31,\n2023. The increase since December 31, 2022\nrepresents organic capital generation,\npartially offset by the CECL phase-in.\n\n\u2022 Truist closed the sale of the minority stake\nin TIH on April 3, 2023, which adds 30 basis\npoints to the risk-based regulatory capital\nratios.\n\n\u2022 Truist declared common dividends of $0.52\nper share during the first quarter of 2023.\nThe dividend payout ratio for the first\nquarter of 2023 was 49%. Truist did not\nrepurchase any shares in the first quarter of\n2023.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s average consolidated LCR was 113%\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2023,\ncompared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n\u2022 Truist has significant and strong access to\nliquidity with $166 billion of available\nliquidity as of March 31, 2023.\n\n\u2022 Truist increased its cash position in\nresponse to market events.\n\n\u2022 AOCI improved by $1.0 billion, or 7.5%,\nsince December 31, 2022.\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nfirst quarter of 2023 was up $710 million, or\n22%, compared to the first quarter of 2022\nprimarily due to higher short-term interest\nrates and strong loan growth, alongside well\ncontrolled deposit costs. These increases were\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion and PPP revenue. Net interest margin\nwas 3.17%, up 41 basis points.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets increased $29.2\nbillion, or 6.2%, primarily due to growth in\naverage total loans of $35.1 billion, or 12%,\nand growth in other earning assets of $6.7\nbillion, or 35%, primarily due to an increase\nin balances held at the Federal Reserve to\nsupport liquidity build, partially offset by a\ndecrease in average securities of $12.1\nbillion, or 7.9%.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the total loan portfolio was\n5.81%, up 212 basis points, primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion and PPP revenue. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 2.14%, up 46\nbasis points primarily due to the higher rate\nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $6.8 billion, or\n1.6%, average short-term borrowings increased\n$17.1 billion, and average long-term debt\nincreased $15.7 billion, or 44.5%.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was\n1.12%, up 109 basis points. The average cost\nof short-term borrowings was 4.69%, up 409\nbasis points. The average cost of long-term\ndebt was 4.05%, up 255 basis points. The\nincrease in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio and long-term debt were $673\nmillion and $69 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized\nfair value marks on the loan and lease\nportfolio and long-term debt were $741 million\nand $81 million, respectively.\n\nThe remaining unamortized purchase accounting\nfair value mark on loans and leases consists\nof $447 million for consumer loans and leases,\nand $226 million for commercial loans and\nleases. These amounts will be recognized over\nthe remaining contractual lives of the\nunderlying instruments or as paydowns occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n\n42 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Represents daily average balances.\nExcludes basis adjustments for fair value\nhedges.\n\n(2) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

These increases\nwere partially offset by lower merger-related\nand restructuring charges and professional\nfees and outside processing expenses. Merger-\nrelated and restructuring charges and\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nmerger decreased $153 million and $202\nmillion, respectively, due to the completion\nof integration-related activities. Adjusted\nnoninterest expenses, which exclude merger-\nrelated costs and the amortization of\nintangibles increased $373 million, or 12%.\n\n\u2022 Personnel expense increased due to\ninvestments in teammates by increasing\nTruist\u2019s minimum wage, the impact from\nacquisitions, investments in revenue producing\nbusinesses and enterprise technology, and\nhigher other post-retirement benefit expense\n(which is almost entirely offset by higher\nother income), partially offset by lower\npension expenses.\n\n\u2022 Other expense increased primarily due to\nhigher pension expense (driven primarily by\nlower plan assets) and higher operating\nlosses.\n\n\u2022 Regulatory costs increased primarily due to\nan increase in the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance\nassessment rate.\n\n\u2022 Professional fees and outside processing\nexpenses decreased due to lower project spend\nfor merger-related activities, partially\noffset by enterprise technology investments.\n\nMerger-Related and Restructuring Charges\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\nmerger-related and restructuring charges and\nthe related accruals. The 2023 merger-related\nand restructuring costs primarily reflect\ncharges as a result of the restructuring\nactivities, including costs for severance and\nother benefits, costs related to exiting\nfacilities, and other restructuring\ninitiatives.\n                                              \n  T\u2026                                          \n  4:                                          \n  M\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026       Ac\u2026                           Ac\u2026  \n  A\u2026        at                            at  \n  (\u2026       Jan                           Mar  \n  in        1,                           31,  \n  m\u2026       20\u2026       Ex\u2026       Ut\u2026       20\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  S\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026    $    9    $   39    $  -31    $   17  \n  p\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026         \u2014        19       -19         \u2014  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026        12         1       -12         1  \n  s\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026         5         4        -5         4  \n  T\u2026    $   26    $   63    $  -67    $   22  \n                                              \n                                              \n  Provision for Income Taxes                  \n                                              \nThe provision for income taxes was $394\nmillion for the first quarter of 2023,\ncompared to $330 million for the earlier\nquarter. The effective tax rate for the first\nquarter of 2023 was 20.6%, compared to 18.9%\nfor the earlier quarter.\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate increased compared to\nthe first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by\nhigher income before taxes, discrete tax\nexpense recognized in the current quarter\ncompared to discrete tax benefits recognized\nin the prior quarter, and the adoption of the\nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures\naccounting standard related to the\nproportional amortization of tax credit\ninvestments in the current quarter. This\nguidance resulted in an increase in other\nincome and an increase in tax expense of $17\nmillion for the first quarter of 2023 with no\nimpact to net income.

The decrease in deposits was\nprimarily driven by the impacts of monetary\ntightening and higher-rate alternatives.\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n7.0% compared to the prior quarter and\nrepresented 32.1% of total deposits for the\nfirst quarter of 2023 compared to 34.1% for\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 and 35.1% compared\nto the year ago quarter. Noninterest-bearing\ndeposits declined primarily due to clients\nseeking high-rate alternatives. Average money\nmarket and savings and interest checking\ndeclined 3.4% and 1.0%, respectively, compared\nto the prior quarter. Average time deposits\nincreased 64% due to an increase in wholesale\nfunding and retail-client time deposits.\n\nTruist has a very granular and relationship-\nbased deposit franchise. Approximately 63% of\ndeposits are insured or collateralized. Truist\ndeposit accounts are typically based on long-\nterm relationships and include multiple\nproducts and services. Truist has strong\nmarket share in many of the fastest-growing\nmarkets in the United States. Truist currently\nranks 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in deposit share in 17\nof our top 20 markets, including Atlanta,\nCharlotte, DC, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, and\nRaleigh-Durham, among others. Truist\u2019s\ncommercial deposits are diversified across 21\nindustry groups, with no one sector\nrepresenting more than 10% of Corporate and\nCommercial Banking deposits.\n\nThe estimated amount of deposits that are\nuninsured was $175.9 billion and $189.6\nbillion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively, calculated using the same\nmethodology as the Call Report for Truist\nBank. The decrease in uninsured deposits was\nlargely due to commercial clients that chose\nto diversify into money market mutual funds or\nacross multiple banks. These outflows were\nprimarily higher-cost, non-operational\ndeposits.\n\nBorrowings\n\nAt March 31, 2023, short-term borrowings\ntotaled $23.7 billion, an increase of $256\nmillion compared to December 31, 2022. Average\nshort-term borrowings were $24.1 billion, or\n5.0% of total funding, for the three months\nended March 31, 2023, as compared to $6.9\nbillion, or 1.5%, for the same period in the\nprior year.\n\nLong-term debt provides funding and, to a\nlesser extent, regulatory capital, and\nprimarily consists of senior and subordinated\nnotes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-\nterm debt totaled $69.9 billion at March 31,\n2023, an increase of $26.7 billion compared to\nDecember 31, 2022.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\nframework that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk measurement\nand monitoring and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces\nand the Company\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization.

The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nTruist\u2019s compensation plans are designed to\nconsider teammate\u2019s adherence to and\nsuccessful implementation of Truist\u2019s risk\nvalues and associated policies and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation structure supports\nits core values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nRefer to Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \u201cRisk Management.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 55\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist applies an\naverage deposit beta of approximately 50% to\nits non-maturity interest-bearing accounts\nwhen determining its interest rate\nsensitivity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 50 and 100 rate scenarios\nincorporate a floor of one basis point.\n\nRate sensitivity decreased compared to prior\nperiods, primarily driven by higher starting\nrates, higher deposit betas as rates increase\nand move into the highest beta tiers, and the\naddition of forward starting swaps.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry was very strong post-COVID-19, which\nresulted in growth in noninterest-bearing\ndemand deposits. However, with the significant\nincrease in rates in 2022 and the first\nquarter of 2023, noninterest-bearing deposits\nhave begun to shift to interest-bearing\naccounts. Additional movement above what is\ncurrently projected would reduce the asset\nsensitivity of Truist\u2019s balance sheet because\nthe Company may increase interest-bearing\nfunds to offset the loss of these advantageous\nnoninterest-bearing deposits. Alternatively,\nthe Company may reduce the size of its\ninvestment portfolio to offset the loss of\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits to limit\nthe impact on the balance sheet\u2019s asset\nsensitivity. The behavior of these\nnoninterest-bearing deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist.\n\n56 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at\n100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  18:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n                        Resu\u2026                 \n  Grad\u2026      Base       Assu\u2026                 \n  Chan\u2026    Scena\u2026           a                 \n  in           at       Decr\u2026                 \n  Rates     March          in                 \n  (bps)       31,       Noni\u2026                 \n           2023(\u2026       Dema\u2026                 \n                        Depo\u2026                 \n              $20         $40                 \n           Billi\u2026       Bill\u2026                 \n  Up        -0.29  %    -1.01  %    -1.72  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50     -0.11       -0.63       -1.15     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at March 31, 2023 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nand mortgage banking operations, long-term\ndebt, and other funding sources.

To prepare for the\ntransition to an alternative reference rate,\nmanagement formed a cross-functional project\nteam to address the LIBOR transition. The\nproject team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, Truist had outstanding LIBOR-\nbased instruments that mature after June 30,\n2023, including loan and lease exposures\ntotaling approximately $98 billion, notional\nderivative exposure totaling approximately\n$131 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion,\nand preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These\namounts are inclusive of remediated contracts,\nwhich contain adequate fallback language for\nthe transition.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases has been reviewed and certain\ncontracts require amendments to support the\ntransition away from LIBOR. Impacted lines of\nbusiness have started remediating these\ncontracts to include standardized fallback\nlanguage or amending contracts to new\nreference rates at maturities or based on\nclient request. Current fallback language used\nto remediate contracts that mature after June\n30, 2023 is generally consistent with ARRC\nrecommendations and includes use of \u201chardwired\nfallback\u201d language, which will transition\nloans to a SOFR based rate after June 30,\n2023.\n\nThe progress and approach to remediation\nvaries based on the type of contract and\nexisting language used in the agreement. For\ncommercial lending, a significant number of\nremaining LIBOR contracts required client\noutreach and remediation. Through mid-2022,\nthe Company\u2019s primary focus was supporting new\nloan production using SOFR and other\nalternative reference rates as well as\ntransitioning any renewing LIBOR based\ncontracts to alternative reference rates.\nEfforts have shifted to amend and remediate\ncontracts, excluding mortgage and student\nloans, that mature post June 30, 2023 ($90\nbillion), which will continue to be the focus\nduring 2023. Of the contracts remaining on\nLIBOR that have not yet been remediated or\nmodified to a new reference rate, Truist\u2019s\nintends to add updated fallback language or\nmove these contracts to new reference rates\nprior to cessation. A significant portion of\nthese contracts contain existing fallback\nlanguage that will transition the contract to\na Prime based rate if not remediated, while a\nsmaller population contains no historical\nfallback language. Should the institution be\nunable to remediate all contracts, those based\non Prime will be prioritized to provide a more\nconsistent client experience with the\n\u201chardwired fallback\u201d transition to SOFR. If\nthere are remaining contracts without fallback\nlanguage, Truist may leverage the LIBOR Act\nand corresponding safe harbor provision to\ntransition these loans to SOFR.\n\nTruist\u2019s adjustable-rate mortgage products\n($3.4 billion) have consistent and adequate\nfallback language to transition away from\nLIBOR in line with industry expectations;\ntherefore, these contracts do not require\nremediation. Remediation of student loans\n($4.4 billion) will follow recent guidance\nfrom the Department of Education on the\nreplacement rate for payment allowances on\ncertain student loans and recent guidance from\nthe CFPB to allow transition to \u201ccomparable\nrates,\u201d in the private student loan portfolio,\nwhere LIBOR is used directly. Based on the\nrecent guidance, these portfolios will\ntransition to rates based on SOFR.\n\nUpon the discontinuation of LIBOR, derivatives\nthat reference LIBOR will transition to a\nSOFR-based replacement rate as set forth in\nthe ISDA protocol addressing LIBOR fallbacks\nthrough bilateral amendments, or as\nestablished under the LIBOR Act and rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB. Certain\nderivatives without a clearly defined or\npracticable replacement benchmark rate will\nuse the LIBOR Act to replace LIBOR with a\nSOFR-based rate established by FRB rulemaking\nand follow the ISDA protocol for transition.\nThis legislation will also provide additional\nadministrative benefit for a small portion of\nthe commercial and consumer lending portfolios\nwhere contracts do not contain fallback\nlanguage and have not yet been remediated,\nproviding a remediation path to a SOFR based\nrate.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\nIn addition, the transition from LIBOR to an\nalternative reference rate, such as SOFR, for\nthe Company\u2019s preferred stock and the\nCompany\u2019s and Truist Bank\u2019s floating rate\nnotes is dependent on a number of factors,\nincluding the fallback language for the\napplicable series of preferred stock or notes,\nthe application of the LIBOR Act and the rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB,\ndeterminations to be made by third-party\ncalculation or paying agents rather than the\nCompany or Truist Bank as to the replacement\nrates, and the impact of any publication of a\nsynthetic U.S. dollar LIBOR as currently\nproposed by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nWith the most recent information available on\nthese factors, Truist expects preferred stock\nissuances to utilize LIBOR to transition to\nSOFR. See \u201cNote 12. Shareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d for\ninformation about preferred stock using LIBOR.\n\nTraining has been provided for impacted\nteammates and will continue during 2023.\nTruist will continue to provide timely notices\nand information to impacted clients about the\ntransition during the first half of 2023.\nTruist continues to manage the impact of these\ncontracts and other financial instruments,\nsystems implications, hedging strategies, and\nrelated operational and market risks on\nestablished project plans for business and\noperational readiness to support the\ntransition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate for all product offerings,\nexcept on a limited basis, as permissible. The\nCompany is actively using SOFR as a reference\nrate and has originated approximately $124\nbillion of loans, issued $12.4 billion of\nsenior and subordinated notes, including fixed\nrate notes that convert to SOFR in the future,\nand has $108 billion in notional derivative\nexposure using this alternative reference rate\nas of March 31, 2023. Alternatives, such as\nSOFR, may react differently from LIBOR in\ntimes of economic stress. Truist expects SOFR\nto be the primary pricing benchmark used\nacross the industry and will continue to offer\nadditional SOFR based products. Market risks\nassociated with the transition to alternative\nreference rates are dependent on market\nconditions as loans are transitioned to\nalternative reference rates during 2022 and\nearly 2023. Additional alternative reference\nrates, such as Bloomberg Short Term Bank\nYield, will be supported based on market\ndemand. For a further discussion of the\nvarious risks associated with the potential\ncessation of LIBOR and the transition to\nalternative reference rates, refer to the\nsection titled \u201cItem1A. Risk Factors\u201d in the\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\n                                              \n  Market Risk from Trading Activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$18 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of March 31, 2023.\n\n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Average\none and ten-day VaR measures for the year\nended March 31, 2023 decreased from the same\nperiod of last year, primarily driven by lower\nmarket making inventory.\n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026            \u2026                          \n      \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n      \u2026            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                $  \u2026    $  9    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  \n                   \u2026       6       \u2026       6  \n                   \u2026       4       9       3  \n                   \u2026       9       \u2026       4  \n                                              \n                           8               4  \n                           7               4  \n                           1               4  \n                           \u2026               \u2026  \n                           8               4  \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 59\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.\nThe total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRO policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $87.4 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 113% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At March 31,\n2023, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity.

Truist additionally has the ability to\nincrease sources of funding by pledging\navailable investment securities without a\nhaircut on fair value under the FRB Bank Term\nFunding Program.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Parent Company had 45\nmonths and 37 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n26 months and 22 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings: Recent changes in\nthe Company\u2019s credit ratings and outlooks\ninclude:\n\nOn March 31,2023, S&P Global Ratings affirmed\nthe ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nrevised the outlook on those ratings to\n\u201cstable\u201d from \u201cpositive,\u201d citing heightened\nmarket volatility in the wake of recent bank\nfailures and, with inflation still elevated,\nhigher uncertainty, and greater downside risk\nin the economic outlook. The change in outlook\nwas part of a broader action by S&P Global\nRatings whereby the \u201cpositive\u201d outlook on\nthree other large U.S. banks was revised to\n\u201cstable.\u201d\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital limits, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented internal stress\ncapital ratio minimums to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above internal minimums. Breaches of\ninternal stressed minimums prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist\u2019s capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.5%\napplicable to Truist as of March 31, 2023.\nTruist\u2019s SCB requirement, received in the 2022\nCCAR process, is effective from October 1,\n2022 to September 30, 2023.
