The following\npages provide detail on the responsibilities\nof our independent Lead Director and each\nstanding committee, including the current\nmembers, the principal functions and the\nnumber of meetings held in 2021.\n                                              \n             C\u2026          N\u2026                   \n       A\u2026    a\u2026    E\u2026    a\u2026    R\u2026    \u2026    T\u2026  \n  \u2026    C\u2026    H\u2026    C\u2026    G\u2026    C\u2026    \u2026    C\u2026  \n             C\u2026          C\u2026                   \n             C\u2026                               \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713     C\u2026    \u2713                          \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713                             \u2713    \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                      \u2713     \u2713          \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026          \u2713     \u2713           \u2713          C\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    C\u2026          \u2713                 \u2713        \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026          \u2713                            \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713     \u2713                            \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                  \u2713    \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                \u2713           \u2713              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713     \u2713                                \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                \u2713           \u2713     \u2026        \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                \u2713     \u2713     C\u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                            \u2713     \u2713    \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                \u2713     C\u2026    \u2713              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                \u2713                          \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026          \u2713                 \u2713          \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713                             \u2713        \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                C\u2026    \u2713     \u2713              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713                             \u2713    \u2713   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                      \u2713     \u2713              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    \u2713     \u2713                                \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n1The Trust Committee is a committee of the\nBoard of Directors of Truist Bank. 2\nIndependent Lead Director.\n                                 \n  20    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 1\u0097Election of Directors Independent\nLead Director\n                                              \n  Thomas E.

NARRATIVE TO 2021\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE On an annual\nbasis, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee reviews the compensation paid to our\ndirectors and makes recommendations to the\nBoard regarding any changes. Working with its\nindependent compensation consultant, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee\nannually assesses the competitiveness of\nTruist\u0092s director compensation program\nrelative to our peers. In making this\nassessment, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee reviews (i) the individual pay\ncomponents of our program relative to the pay\ncomponents for directors at our peers, (ii)\nthe average total compensation of our board\nmembers relative to directors at our peers,\nand (iii) our aggregate board compensation as\ncompared to our peer group. The director\ncompensation shown in the table above reflects\ntotal compensation paid to each director for\nservice as a joint member on the Boards of the\nCompany and Truist Bank. A director who is\nalso a teammate of Truist or its subsidiaries\nis not eligible to receive any equity,\nretainer or fees for service on the Board of\nDirectors.\n                                 \n  24    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 1\u0097Election of Directors Our non-\nemployeedirectors are entitled to receive the\nfees shown in the table below.

Deferred equity awards\nare payable in Truist shares after termination\nof a director\u0092s service on the Board. Stock\nOwnership Guidelines. Truist requires each\nnon-employeedirector to hold or control an\namount of common stock equal to five times the\namount of his or her annual cash retainer paid\nby Truist for such director\u0092s services.

Our key corporate\ngovernance practices are summarized below:\n                                              \n  Independence                                \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Independent Board of Directors: 90% of    \n  directors are independent, and our Audit,   \n  Compensation and Human Capital and          \n  Nominating and Governance committees are    \n  composed entirely of independent            \n  directors.                                  \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Independent Lead Director: In March       \n  2022, Thomas E. Skains was named our new    \n  Lead Director, continuing our practice of   \n  providing a strong, independent voice to    \n  this position. Our Lead Director serves an  \n  important governance function by providing  \n  strong leadership for non-management and    \n  independent directors. Our Corporate        \n  Governance Guidelines discuss the           \n  responsibilities placed on our Lead         \n  Director, which we believe provide an       \n  effective counter-balance to the Chairman   \n  and CEO                                     \n  role at Truist.

Our Board members conduct       \n  self-assessments annually and               \n  committee rotation is also considered on    \n  an annual basis.                            \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Robust Shareholder Engagement Program:    \n  We have a formal shareholder engagement     \n  program through which we seek feedback on   \n  our governance practices from our largest   \n  shareholders. The feedback we receive is    \n  communicated directly to our Nominating     \n  and Governance Committee and is             \n  considered in determining whether changes   \n  are needed to our corporate governance      \n  practices.                                  \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Clawbacks: We make all executive          \n  awards (cash and equity) subject to         \n  recoupment as determined by the             \n  Compensation and Human Capital Committee.   \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Executive Risk Scorecard: We utilize      \n  an executive risk scorecard, which the      \n  Compensation and Human Capital Committee    \n  may use to reduce incentive compensation    \n  for negative risk outcomes.                 \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Comprehensive Board Development: Our      \n  Board Development Program provides a        \n  formal framework designed to support the    \n  directors\u0092 performance of their              \n  responsibilities as members of the Board    \n  and Board committees.                       \n                                              \n                                 \n  26    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance\n                                              \n  Environmental, Social and                   \n  Governance \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u200aCorporate Social             \n  Responsibility/ESG: We publish an annual    \n  CSR and ESG Report, highlighting our good   \n  stewardship of the natural resources        \n  entrusted to us, our promotion of our       \n  teammates\u0092 and communities\u0092 well-being, and   \n  our strong corporate governance program.    \n  In December 2021 we issued our first TCFD   \n  report focused on Truist\u0092s efforts to        \n  measure and share climate-related risks,    \n  opportunities, goals, and                   \n  progress. Our Nominating and Governance     \n  Committee reviews and approves our ESG      \n  reports, oversees the Company\u0092s              \n  environmental, social and governance        \n  matters and management\u0092s integration of our  \n  purpose, values and culture within Truist.  \n  Our                                         \n  Risk Committee provides oversight of the    \n  Company\u0092s progress on ESG risk management    \n  initiatives and activities.                 \n  \u0095\u2002\u200aDiversity, Equity and Inclusion: At       \n  Truist, we are actively pursuing a diverse  \n  culture and creating an equitable and       \n  inclusive environment where diverse         \n  perspectives are shared and respected. We   \n  understand the importance of diversity to   \n  the growth of our teammates and the         \n  development                                 \n  of our communities.

The Corporate Governance\nGuidelines address a number of matters\napplicable to directors, including director\nqualification standards, director independence\nrequirements, share ownership guidelines,\nBoard responsibilities, Board development,\nrole of the independent Lead Director,\nretirement, meetings of non-\nmanagementdirectors, and director\ncompensation. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Our Board\nof Directors is committed to maintaining\nobjective, independent oversight of management\nin upholding its responsibilities to our\nshareholders and in carrying out the strategic\nobjectives of the Company. The value we place\non the independence of our directors is\nreflected in our corporate governance\ndocuments, Board Committee Charters, annual\nindependence review of our Board members and\nthe role of our Lead Director. In determining\ndirector independence, our Board considers the\nNew York Stock Exchange\u0092s (\u0093NYSE\u0094) bright-line\nindependence criteria and the standards set\nforth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nConsistent with NYSE rules, our Board of\nDirectors also broadly considers all other\nrelevant facts and circumstances that bear on\nthe materiality of each director\u0092s\nrelationship with Truist, including the\npotential for conflicts of interest, when\ndetermining director independence. In making\nan independence determination, no director\nqualifies as \u0093independent\u0094 unless the Board\naffirmatively determines that the director has\nno material relationship, and has not had such\na relationship within the past three years,\nwith Truist or any of its subsidiaries.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    27  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance\nTo assist it in making\nindependence\ndeterminations, our\nBoard of Directors has\nadopted categorical\nstandards which are\ncontained in our\nCorporate Governance\nGuidelines.

As a part of this evaluation process,\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee also\nconsiders each director\u0092s occupation, other\npublicly held company directorships, personal\nand affiliate transactions with Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, relationships considered in\naccordance with our Related Person\nTransactions Policy, and other relevant direct\nand indirect relationships that may affect\nindependence. In particular, the Board\nconsidered Truist\u0092s purchase or provision of\nproducts or services during the last three\nyears from or to each entity where a director,\nincluding Messrs. Clement, Donahue and\nVoorhees, was an executive officer or employee\nof such entity, or had an immediate family\nmember who was an executive officer of such\nentity, and where that entity made payments to\nor received payments from Truist or any of its\nsubsidiaries for products or services;\nhowever, all such transactions were made: (a)\nin the ordinary course of business on\nsubstantially the same terms as those\nprevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties, (b) in\nthe aggregate for any single fiscal year, did\nnot exceed 0.25% of Truist\u0092s or such other\nentity\u0092s gross revenue, and (c) were\nimmaterial to both Truist and the other\nentity. After duly considering all such\ninformation, our Board of Directors has\naffirmatively determined that of the 21\nmembers of the Board, the following 19\ndirectors have no disqualifying material\nrelationships with Truist or its subsidiaries\nand are independent:\n                                              \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009        \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009Paul     \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009        \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009       \n  Jennif\u2026    D.\u00a0         Charles    Thomas\u00a0   \n  S.\u00a0        Donahue     A.\u00a0        E.\u00a0       \n  Banner                 Patton     Skains    \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009K.\u00a0     \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009                              \n  David\u00a0     Patrick\u00a0    \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009Nido    \u0095\u2002\u2009\u2009Bruce  \n  Boyer,\u00a0    C.\u00a0         R.

Prior to the resignation becoming\neffective, the Board, through the Nominating\nand Governance Committee, will review any such\nchange and determine whether to accept or\nreject the director\u0092s resignation. SERVICE ON\nOTHER BOARDS A director must advise the\nChairman of the Board and the Chair of the\nNominating and Governance Committee before\naccepting an invitation to serve on another\npublic or private company board. If the\ninvitation is to serve on another public\ncompany board, the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee will review whether such board\nservice may unduly impact the ability of the\ndirector to fulfill his or her\nresponsibilities as a director of Truist and,\nif so, shall make a recommendation to the\nBoard. A non-employeedirector of Truist may\nnot serve on more than three other public\ncompany boards, and a non-employeedirector of\nTruist who is also the chief executive officer\nof another public company may not serve on\nmore than two public company boards, including\nthe Truist Board. Employee directors of Truist\nmay not serve on more than two public company\nboards, including the Truist Board. In\naddition, if a member of the Audit Committee\ndesires to serve on the audit committees of\nmore than a total of three public companies,\nthe Board must approve such additional service\nbefore the director accepts the additional\nposition. Members of Executive Leadership may\nserve on one public company board, in addition\nto the Truist Board, with the approval of the\nChief Executive Officer or, in the case of the\nChief Executive Officer, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    29  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance BOARD DEVELOPMENT Our\nBoard Development Program provides a formal\nframework designed to support the directors\u0092\nperformance of their responsibilities as\nmembers of the Board and Board Committees. The\nBoard Development Program allows directors to\nsupplement their existing skill sets and stay\ninformed of emerging risks and trends in\nTruist\u0092s business and the broader financial\nservices industry in general. The programs and\ncourses are provided by both in-houseexperts\nand outside consultants on a wide range of\ntopics to enhance the directors\u0092 knowledge in\nareas important in carrying out their\nresponsibilities as directors. Programs and\npresentations of general application are\noffered to the full Board while others are\ntailored to the specific requirements of the\nvarious Board Committees. The programs and\ncourses offered through our development\nprogram are in addition to programs and\ncourses in which our Board members regularly\nparticipate in order to maintain professional\ncredentials, including courses related to\nethics. Newly elected directors undergo an\nextensive director orientation process. We\nview the director orientation process as a\nmeans to acquaint newly elected directors with\nour businesses and corporate governance\nframework, and also to further our directors\u0092\nunderstanding of our culture and the Board\u0092s\nrole in determining the Company\u0092s culture and\noverseeing management\u0092s assurance of corporate\nintegrity. Our Chief Legal Officer and other\nmembers of Executive Leadership facilitate a\ndetailed Board orientation session. These\nsessions review the Company\u0092s culture and\nvalues, codes of ethics, strategic objectives\nand planning, risk management matters,\ncompliance programs, internal audit services\nand our corporate governance program.\nAdditional topics covered in orientation\ninclude the Company\u0092s business structure,\nincluding regulatory oversight, laws governing\ndirectors\u0092 duties and conduct, Truist\u0092s\nsecurities law policies, and liability\ninsurance coverage. Additionally, new\ndirectors and rotating directors each attend\nan orientation of the committee(s) on which\nthey serve, which covers in detail the\noperation and duties of the relevant\ncommittee. BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE SELF-\nASSESSMENT On an annual basis, our Board of\nDirectors evaluates its effectiveness over the\npreceding year. Each director participates in\nthe evaluation process and each committee is\nseparately evaluated. The evaluation process\nis managed by our Nominating and Governance\nCommittee with assistance from our Office of\nthe Corporate Secretary. During our Board\nevaluation process, directors are presented\nwith a written questionnaire designed to\nelicit constructive feedback from each\ndirector about his or her individual service\nand the effectiveness of the Board and each\ncommittee on which the director serves. In\n2021, the Executive Chairman or Lead Director\nseparately called each director personally\nafter distribution of the questionnaires to\nsolicit concerns or input regarding the\nperformance of the Board or its committees.\nResponses received from our directors are\ndiscussed with the full Board as well as each\nstanding committee in executive sessions. This\nfeedback is used to improve Board and\ncommittee practices, procedures and policies\nand, as appropriate, is discussed with members\nof Executive Leadership to improve\nefficiencies and effectiveness. SUCCESSION\nPLANNING AT TRUIST Human capital management\nand talent development is a priority for the\nBoard of Directors. Our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines provide that the Board of Directors\nis responsible for ensuring that we have\ndeveloped an Executive Leadership succession\nplan, including procedures for Chief Executive\nOfficer selection in the event of an emergency\nor the retirement of the CEO. This plan is\nreviewed and evaluated by the Board at least\nannually. The Lead Director facilitates the\nBoard\u0092s review and evaluation of our Executive\nLeadership succession plan. As part of the\nplan, our Chairman and CEO evaluates and\nrecommends potential successors, along with a\nreview of any development plans of such\nindividuals. CEO and Chairman Succession On\nSeptember 12, 2021, Mr. Rogers succeeded Mr.\nKing as Chief Executive Officer. At that time,\nMr. King became Executive Chairman of Truist\nuntil March 12, 2022. On March 12, 2022, Mr.\nRogers became Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors of Truist, and Mr. King retained his\nrole as a director of the Company and will\nalso serve as a consultant to the Company\nuntil September 12, 2022. This succession plan\nwas agreed upon as part of the merger of\nequals of BB&T and SunTrust to form Truist. If\nMr. Rogers becomes unable to serve as Truist\u0092s\nChief Executive Officer, the independent Lead\nDirector is authorized to (i) promptly call a\nspecial meeting of the Board of Directors to\nappoint an individual to assume the authority\nand responsibility of Chief Executive Officer\non a temporary or permanent basis, depending\nupon the circumstances; and (ii) assume the\nresponsibility of the Chief Executive Officer,\nwithout the necessity of further action by the\nBoard of Directors, pending such appointment.\nBoard Leadership Structure CHAIRMAN OF THE\nBOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Our Board of\nDirectors is led by the Chairman. Under our\nbylaws, the Chairman is elected by the Board\nand presides over each Board meeting and\nperforms such other duties as may be incident\nto the office of Chairman. Our bylaws and\nCorporate Governance Guidelines each provide\nthat the Chairman may also hold the position\nof Chief Executive Officer. Truist\u0092s Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer is not permitted\nto serve as a member of any standing Board\nCommittee, other than the Executive Committee,\nthe Risk Committee and the Technology\nCommittee. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nprovide that when the position of Chairman of\nthe Board is not held by an independent\ndirector, the Board will appoint an\nindependent Lead Director.\n                                 \n  30    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance It is the Board\u0092s current\nbelief that having a unified Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer is appropriate and in\nthe best interests of Truist and our\nshareholders. The Board believes that\ncombining the Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer roles at this time provides the\nfollowing advantages to us:\n                                              \n    our Chief Executive Officer is more       \n    familiar with our current business and    \n    industry than our non-management          \n    directors and is best situated to lead    \n    discussions on important matters          \n    affecting the business of Truist;         \n                                              \n                                              \n    combining the Chief Executive Officer     \n    and Chairman positions, along with a      \n    strong partnership with the independent   \n    Lead                                      \n    Director, creates a firm link between     \n    management and the Board and promotes     \n    both the development and implementation   \n    of corporate strategy; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n    combining the roles of Chief Executive    \n    Officer and Chairman contributes to a     \n    more efficient and effective Board,       \n    promotes                                  \n    unity of vision for the Company and       \n    avoids potential conflict among           \n    directors.                                \n                                              \nThe Board is aware of the potential issues\nthat may arise when an insider chairs the\nboard of a company but believes these are more\nthan offset by existing safeguards, which\ninclude the designation of a strong\nindependent Lead Director with a clearly\ndefined role and authority set forth in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines and discussed\nfurther below. In addition, our Board\nregularly meets in executive session with the\nnon-managementdirectors outside the presence\nof management. Further, only our independent\ndirectors are involved in meetings to discuss\nsuccession planning and CEO compensation,\nwhere peer benchmarking is extensively used.\nINDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR Effective March 12,\n2022, Thomas E. Skains was appointed as the\nBoard\u0092s Lead Director, subject to the normal\nrotation policy for Lead Director service as\nset forth in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines. This Lead Director transition was\neffected pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement and coincided with Mr. Rogers\u0092\nappointment as Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors of Truist. Going forward, our Lead\nDirector will be selected as described in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, which require\nthat our Lead Director (i) be appointed by a\nmajority vote of the independent directors and\n(ii) serve in such capacity for an initial\ntwo-yearterm (subject to annual election as a\ndirector by the shareholders), and may serve\nfor subsequent one-yearterm(s) at the\ndiscretion of the Board. The role of the Lead\nDirector is to assist the Chairman and the\nremainder of the Board in assuring effective\ngovernance in overseeing the direction and\nmanagement of Truist. Our Board believes that\nthe Lead Director serves an important\ncorporate governance function by providing\nstrong, independent leadership for the non-\nmanagementdirectors and provides an\nappropriate balance to the Chairman and CEO at\nTruist. In addition to the formal list of\nduties performed by our Lead Director as set\nforth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines,\nhe also meets with regulators, participates in\nshareholder engagement calls and attends\nmeetings with senior management. Our\nindependent Lead Director also presides over\nmeetings of our non-managementdirectors in\nexecutive session in connection with each\nregular Board meeting and at such other times\nas deemed necessary or desirable. A more\ncomplete description of the role of our Lead\nDirector is included in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines and in the discussion\nabove under, \u0093Standing Board Committee\nMembership and Lead Director\nResponsibilities.\u0094 In 2020, our Board of\nDirectors approved changes to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, placing the following\nadditional responsibilities on the role of our\nindependent Lead Director:\n                                              \n    Approve Board agendas and information     \n    sent to the Board in preparation for      \n    Board meetings                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    Authority to call and preside over        \n    meetings of the independent directors     \n                                              \n                                              \n    Approve all Board and Committee meeting   \n    schedules                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    Preside over executive sessions of the    \n    non-management directors, which will      \n    occur                                     \n    at each regular Board meeting             \n                                              \nWe believe that these enhancements further\nstrengthen the role of our Lead Director and\nprovide an appropriate balance to the Chairman\nand CEO at Truist. Board Size As part of the\nmerger agreement between BB&T and SunTrust,\nthe size of our Board of Directors was set at\n22. While the Board believes that its current\nsize provides it with certain advantages,\nfollowing the resignation of Director Paul R.\nGarcia in October 2021, the Board took the\nopportunity to amend Truist\u0092s bylaws and\nreduce the size of the Board to 21 directors.\nThis decision was based, in part, on feedback\nwe had received from our shareholder\nengagement program. While our Board believes\nits current size provides advantages in\nintegrating our two heritage companies\nfollowing the merger of equals and addressing\nthe significant regulatory, economic, and\ntechnological pressures experienced by\nfinancial institutions, our Board will\ncontinue to annually evaluate its size and\nstructure. In addition, the size of our Board\nhas provided us the necessary focus handling\nthe continued developments and changes\nrequired due to the COVID-19pandemic. These\npressures have required substantial time\ncommitments and other demands from our\ndirectors.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    31  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance The size of our Board\nalso is an advantage when evaluating our\ncommittee structure, including the decision to\ncreate a Technology Committee to assist the\nBoard in its oversight of technology strategy\nand risk, and assigning an appropriate number\nof members to each committee in order to\nproperly analyze and respond to increasingly\ncomplex developments, whether regulatory,\neconomic, technological or otherwise. The\ndiversity of viewpoints on each committee also\nallows for more effective challenge to\nproposals from management and directors. In\naddition, the number of independent directors\naids in maintaining the requisite independence\nstandards of the Audit, Compensation and Human\nCapital, and Nominating and Governance\nCommittees. The Board believes that its\ncurrent size and structure is appropriate to\neffectively represent the interests of our\nshareholders. Nominating and Governance\nCommittee Director Nominations The Nominating\nand Governance Committee is responsible for\nidentifying and recommending to the Board\nnominees for election or reelection as\ndirectors. We seek as director candidates\nindividuals who possess good judgment,\nstrength of character, and an independent\nmind, as well as a reputation for integrity\nand the highest personal and professional\nethics in order to most effectively serve the\nlong-term interests of Truist and its\nshareholders. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee considers candidates submitted by\ndirectors and third-party search firms hired\nfor identifying director candidates. The\nNominating and Governance Committee also\nconsiders candidates submitted by\nshareholders, subject to the requirements\ndescribed below. As evidenced by the\ncomposition of our Board, the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee strives to include\ndirector candidates who are racially and\ngender diverse, with skills and\ncharacteristics that, taken as a whole, will\nhelp ensure a strong and effective governing\nbody. The Nominating and Governance Committee\nconducts an extensive due diligence process to\nreview potential director candidates and their\nindividual qualifications, and all such\ncandidates, including those submitted by\nshareholders, will be evaluated by the\nNominating and Governance Committee using the\ndirector membership criteria described below.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee then\nreports to the Board its recommendations\nconcerning each director nominee. The Board\nconsiders the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee\u0092s recommendations when appointing\ndirectors and selecting director nominees to\nbe submitted by Truist to shareholders for\nelection at the annual meeting of\nshareholders. DIRECTOR MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA A\ndirector candidate is nominated to stand for\nelection based on his or her professional\nexperience, strategic insights, recognized\nachievement in his or her respective field, an\nability to contribute to our business,\nexperience in risk management, and the\nwillingness to make the commitment of time and\neffort required of a Truist director over an\nextended period of time. A director must be\n\u0093financially literate,\u0094 as defined by the\nBoard, and should understand the intricacies\nof a public company. A director should possess\ngood judgment, strength of character, and an\nindependent mind, as well as a reputation for\nintegrity and the highest personal and\nprofessional ethics. Other factors are also\nconsidered to ensure the overall composition\nof the Truist Board is appropriate. An\nimportant goal of the Board, pursued through\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee, is to\ninclude members with diverse backgrounds,\nexpertise and characteristics that, taken as a\nwhole, will help ensure a strong and effective\ngoverning body. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee annually assesses these factors in\nthe director selection and nomination process.\nDIRECTOR CANDIDATES RECOMMENDED BY\nSHAREHOLDERS The Board of Directors also will\nconsider qualified director nominees submitted\nin advance by shareholders when such\nrecommendations are submitted with the\ninformation set forth in Article II, Section\n10 of the Company\u0092s bylaws and policies\nregarding director nominations. Under this\nprovision of our bylaws, a shareholder must\ndeliver timely written notice at least 120\ndays, but no more than 150 days, in advance of\nthe first anniversary of the notice date of\nour proxy statement for the preceding year\u0092s\nannual meeting of shareholders.

Shareholders\nand director nominees utilizing this provision\nof our bylaws must satisfy the specific\ninformation required by Article II, Section 14\nof our bylaws. In addition, notice of any such\nnomination must be received at least 120 days,\nbut no more than 150 days, before the\nanniversary of the date that the Company\ncommenced mailing the proxy statement for the\nprior year\u0092s annual meeting of shareholders.\nWritten notices pursuant to the above bylaw\nprovisions must be submitted in accordance\nwith the general procedures for shareholder\nnominations (including deadlines for the\nnotice to be received by the Corporate\nSecretary), which are summarized under the\ncaption \u0093Voting and Other Information-\nProposals for the 2023 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders\u0094 below. Shareholders may submit,\nin writing, the names and qualifications of\npotential director nominees to the Corporate\nSecretary, Truist Financial Corporation, 214\nN. Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina\n28202. Majority Voting and Director\nResignation Policy Our articles of\nincorporation require each director to be\nelected by the majority of the votes cast at a\nmeeting of shareholders. Under our Director\nResignation Policy, as described in our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, any director\nnominee who receives a greater number of votes\n\u0093against\u0094 than votes \u0093for\u0094 such election shall\ntender his or her resignation to the Board.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will\nthen consider all of the relevant facts and\ncircumstances and recommend to the Board\nwhether to accept, reject or otherwise act\nwith respect to such resignation. The Board\nwill act on the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee\u0092s recommendation within 90 days\nfollowing certification of the shareholder\nvote and will publicly disclose its decision\nwithin this 90-daytimeframe. A director whose\nresignation is under consideration will\nabstain from participating in any\nrecommendation or decision regarding that\nresignation. If a director\u0092s resignation is\nnot accepted, the director will continue to\nserve until the next annual meeting of\nshareholders and until the director\u0092s\nsuccessor is elected and qualified, or until\nthe director\u0092s earlier resignation or removal.\nCurrently, pursuant to North Carolina law and\nour bylaws, an incumbent director who is not\nre-electedremains in office until the\ndirector\u0092s successor is elected and qualified\nor until his or her earlier resignation or\nremoval. Our current Director Resignation\nPolicy addresses this \u0093holdover\u0094 issue by\nrequiring any director who does not receive\nthe requisite affirmative majority of the\nvotes cast for his or her re-electionto tender\nhis or her resignation to the Board as\ndescribed above. Related Person Transactions\nPursuant to our Related Person Transactions\nPolicy, we approve or ratify related person\ntransactions only when the Board, acting\nthrough the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee, determines that the related person\ntransaction in question is in, or is not\ninconsistent with, the best interests of\nTruist and its shareholders. The term \u0093related\nperson transaction,\u0094 under the Policy,\ngenerally means a transaction where the amount\ninvolved exceeds $120,000 in a single fiscal\nyear and in which a related person has a\ndirect or indirect material interest. A\n\u0093related person\u0094 under the Policy generally\nmeans (a) a director, director nominee or\nexecutive officer of Truist; (b) a person who\nis known to be the beneficial owner of more\nthan five percent of any class of our common\nstock; and (c) any immediate family member of\nany of the foregoing persons, which consists\nof any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent,\nspouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law,\nson-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-lawor\nsister-in-lawof the director, executive\nofficer, nominee, or more than five percent\nbeneficial owner, and any person (other than a\ntenant or employee) sharing the household of\nsuch director, executive officer, nominee, or\nmore than five percent beneficial owner. To\nhelp the Board assess whether a material\nrelationship exists for both independence and\nrelated person transactions purposes, our\nBoard adopted guidance with regard to\ncharitable contributions. Under this guidance,\na related person who serves as an executive\nofficer of a charitable or non-\nprofitorganization that receives a\ncontribution from Truist will not be deemed to\nhave a direct or indirect material interest in\nthe transaction if:\n                                              \n    Within the past three years, the          \n    aggregate amount of all such              \n    contributions during any single fiscal    \n    year of the                               \n    charitable or non-profit organization     \n    did not exceed the greater of $1\u00a0million  \n    or 2% of the charitable or non-profit     \n    organization\u0092s consolidated gross          \n    revenues                                  \n    for that fiscal year; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    The charitable or non-profit              \n    organization is not a family foundation   \n    created by                                \n    the related person or an immediate        \n    family member of the related person.      \n                                              \nIn addition, to monitor charitable\ncontributions provided by Truist, any\ncharitable contribution in excess of $5\nmillion made by Truist to any charitable or\nnon-profitorganization of which a director or\nexecutive officer of Truist serves as a\ndirector, trustee, executive officer, advisory\nboard member or in any similar leadership\ncapacity must be approved by the Nominating\nand Governance Committee, whether or not the\ndirector or executive officer has a direct or\nindirect material interest in the\ncontribution. Further, charitable\ncontributions of $500,000 or more to such\norganizations must be reported at the next\nNominating and Governance Committee meeting.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    33  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance A number of our\ndirectors, members of Executive Leadership,\nincluding our NEOs, and their affiliates\nutilize certain products and services offered\nby Truist, including personal and corporate\nbanking, securities brokerage, investment\nadvisory and wealth management services, in\nthe ordinary course of our business. Our\nRelated Person Transactions Policy provides\nthat certain categories of transactions do not\nneed review or approval of the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee. These include all\nextensions of credit with related persons that\nare made in the ordinary course of business on\nsubstantially the same terms, including\ninterest rates and collateral, as those\nprevailing at the time for comparable loans\nwith persons not related to Truist, and that\ndo not involve more than the normal risk of\ncollectability or present other features\nunfavorable to Truist (although pursuant to\nFederal Reserve Board Regulation O, extensions\nof credit to directors, executive officers or\ntheir related interests that exceed $500,000\nin the aggregate must be approved in advance\nby the full Board). These transactions also\ninclude any provision of financial services to\na related person, other than extensions of\ncredit, such as brokerage, banking, insurance,\ninvestment advisory, investment banking or\nasset management services, if the services are\nprovided in the ordinary course of business,\non substantially the same terms as those\nprevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties and comply\nwith applicable law. In addition, in the\nordinary course of business, Truist may use\nthe products or services of organizations of\nwhich one of our directors is an officer or\ndirector. Since January 1, 2021, other than as\ndescribed below, there have been no related\nperson transactions that were required either\nto be approved or ratified under our Related\nPerson Transactions Policy or reported under\nthe SEC\u0092s related person transaction rules.\nBased on information contained in separate\nSchedule 13G/A filings with the SEC, each of\nBlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc.\nreported that it beneficially owned more than\n5% of the outstanding shares of our common\nstock as of December 31, 2021. During 2021,\nwe, and our affiliates, engaged in\ntransactions in the ordinary course of\nbusiness with BlackRock and Vanguard,\nincluding sales of debt securities of the\nCompany and Truist Bank in public offerings of\nthose securities and sales of other fixed\nincome securities by our institutional broker-\ndealer subsidiary. Such transactions were on\nsubstantially the same terms as those\nprevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions with unrelated third parties.\nSection 16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u0093Exchange\nAct\u0094) requires our directors, executive\nofficers and any persons who own beneficially\nmore than 10% of our common stock to file\nreports of ownership and changes in ownership\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTo our knowledge, based solely on a review of\nthe reports furnished to us and written\nrepresentations from reporting persons that\nall reportable transactions were reported, we\nbelieve that during the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, our officers, directors and\ngreater than 10% owners timely filed all\nreports they were required to file under\nSection 16(a). Shareholder Engagement Program\nGENERAL Truist\u0092s shareholder engagement\nprogram is a robust, year-round process that\nincludes outreach to shareholders,\nincorporating analysis of results of our\nannual meeting, key topics of importance to\nour shareholders, and board deliberations. We\nlisten closely to our shareholders to\nunderstand their views on a variety of topics,\nincluding our executive compensation and\ncorporate governance programs, as well as\nenvironmental and social, or ESG, issues\ninvolving the Company. At Truist, our\nshareholder engagement program is designed to\nencompass a dialogue with our shareholders on\nseveral levels, including:\n                                              \n    Periodic telephonic meetings with our     \n    larger institutional shareholders;        \n                                              \n                                              \n    In-person, or virtual, meetings with      \n    institutional shareholder                 \n    representatives as                        \n    requested;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n    Responses to shareholder correspondence;  \n                                              \n                                              \n    Dialogue with shareholder proponents;     \n    and                                       \n                                              \n                                           \n    Engagement with proxy advisory firms.  \n                                           \nTruist\u0092s Nominating and Governance Committee\nis responsible for overseeing our shareholder\nengagement program, and our Lead Director and\nmembers of Executive Leadership play keys\nroles in our outreach efforts by participating\nin phone calls with several of our largest\nshareholders. The shareholder engagement\nprogram complements the work performed by our\nInvestor Relations team in regularly\ncommunicating with our shareholders, including\nthrough investor conferences and meetings, and\nhosting quarterly earnings calls. Feedback\nfrom calls with our shareholders is provided\nto the Board and Nominating and Governance\nCommittee.\n                                 \n  34    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCorporate Governance GOALS OF SHAREHOLDER\nENGAGEMENT The goals of our shareholder\nengagement program include, but are not\nlimited to:\n                                              \n    Providing our Board and Executive         \n    Leadership observations from our          \n    shareholders on our corporate             \n    governance, executive                     \n    compensation, and environmental, social   \n    and governance (ESG) practices;           \n                                              \n                                              \n    Discussing current trends in corporate    \n    governance, ESG and executive             \n    compensation matters; and                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    Offering insight into our current         \n    practices and enhancing communication     \n    with our largest shareholders.            \n                                              \nOur shareholder engagement program allows\nExecutive Leadership and the Board to gather\ninformation about investor views and\npriorities and make thoughtful and deliberate\ndecisions that are balanced and considerate of\nour diverse shareholder base and in the best\ninterests of Truist. In the past, we have used\nthe feedback from our shareholder engagement\nprogram to enhance the rights of our\nshareholders and strengthen the role of our\nindependent Lead Director. SHAREHOLDER\nENGAGEMENT PROCESS SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK Our\nengagement with shareholders in 2020 led to\nseveral proactive changes to our governance\npractices, in particular increasing the\nresponsibilities of our independent Lead\nDirector. Following that engagement, in the\nFall of 2021, we contacted our 50 largest\ninstitutional shareholders, representing\napproximately 52% of our outstanding shares.\nWe invited each of these shareholders to a\ncall with representatives from the Company,\nincluding our independent Lead Director in\ninstances where the shareholder held more than\n1% of our outstanding shares. Topics discussed\nat these meetings included, among other items:\n(1) corporate governance; (2) corporate social\nresponsibility and initiatives Truist is\npursuing in this area; and (3) Executive\nLeadership changes and related compensation\nmatters. Shareholders were especially\nsupportive of the Company\u0092s efforts in areas\nrelated to the environment, social issues, and\ncorporate governance matters. Following these\ncalls, Company management reviews shareholder\nfeedback with the Nominating and Governance\nCommittee and takes that feedback into\nconsideration, along with feedback from our\nBoard of Directors, feedback from shareholders\nreceived outside of our fall outreach effort,\nand peer practices, when planning future\ncompany policies, practices, and disclosures\nin public filings. The Board and management\nendeavor to listen, consider and respond to\nthe results of our shareholder engagement\nprocess throughout the year in shaping the\ngoals and objectives of Truist, including\nenhancing disclosure regarding environmental,\nsocial issues and corporate governance\nmatters. To that end, we published our first\nTCFD report in December 2021 and recently in\n2022 announced our goals for net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions.

The Board\noversees the development of, approves, and\nperiodically monitors the Company\u0092s strategy\nand risk appetite (including a clear and\naligned strategy and risk appetite, with long-\nterm perspective on risks and rewards).\nAccordingly, management and the Board\nregularly discuss the Company\u0092s strategy and\nprogress towards achieving results against the\nrelated strategic objectives and initiatives.\nThese interactions result in Board input that\ninforms management\u0092s updates to the strategic\nplan, which are presented to the Board for\nadoption on an annual basis. The Company\u0092s\nstrategic planning process includes an\nindependent risk assessment to confirm that\nstrategic activities are consistent with the\nBoard-approved risk appetite. The Board\u0092s\ninteractions with management throughout the\nyear include, but are not limited to, the\nformal review and adoption of the updated\nstrategic plan and a mid-yearperformance\nupdate. Information Security/Cybersecurity We\nare committed to protecting client\ninformation, and our Board of Directors and\nExecutive Leadership team devote a significant\namount of time and attention to information\nsecurity / cybersecurity risks. The Risk\nCommittee of the Board is responsible for\noversight of the Company\u0092s risk management\nfunction, involving approving and reviewing\nthe Company\u0092s risk management framework and\npolicies as well as overseeing management\u0092s\nimplementation of Truist\u0092s risk management\nframework and significant risk policies.\nMembers of the Risk Committee receive regular\nreports from our Chief Risk Officer and Chief\nTechnology Risk Officer related to information\ntechnology and information security /\ncybersecurity risks to our Company. The Risk\nCommittee may meet throughout the year with\nrisk management advisors and discuss with\nExecutive Leadership any recommendations\nreceived. The Technology Committee of the\nBoard assists the Board and the Risk Committee\nin oversight of the Company\u0092s technology\nrisks. The Technology Committee receives\nreports from management regarding the\nCompany\u0092s practices, management, and\nfunctioning of technology operations and\ninformation security / cybersecurity risks,\nand reviews and discusses the Company\u0092s\ntechnology policies, standards and controls.\nOn at least a semi-annual basis, the\nTechnology Committee reports to the Risk\nCommittee the significant activities\nundertaken by the Technology Committee\ninvolving oversight of technology risks in\nsupport of the Risk Committee\u0092s overall\nresponsibility and oversight of the Company\u0092s\nrisk management framework. The Chief\nInformation Security Officer provides updates\nat every Technology Committee meeting on\ninformation security / cybersecurity risk, and\nthe Board annually reviews and approves our\nInformation Security Program and Information\nSecurity Policy. The Technology Management\nCommittee is an internal committee created to\nensure that members of Executive Leadership\noverseeing multiple business units understand\npertinent technology-related topics, including\ninformation security / cybersecurity and\nassociated risks. The Technology Management\nCommittee provides additional oversight of\ninformation security / cybersecurity strategy,\nincluding understanding and prioritizing\ninformation security / cybersecurity\ncapabilities and associated risks. Statement\nof Political Engagement Our Executive\nLeadership team has direct responsibility for\nour political activities, while our Board of\nDirectors periodically reviews the management\nof our overall political strategy, political\ncontributions and lobbying expenses. Truist\nparticipates in policy debates on issues to\nsupport our interests and sponsors employee\npolitical action committees, or PACs, which\nallow teammates to voluntarily pool their\nfinancial resources to support federal and\nstate candidates who support legislation\nimportant to us, and our shareholders, clients\nand communities. All PAC expenditures are a\nmatter of public record and are available for\nreview on the websites of the Federal Election\nCommission and various state election offices.\nCorporate funds are not used to make\ncontributions to political candidates,\npolitical parties, or political committees\norganized for the advancement of a political\ncandidate, including Super PACs. Truist has a\nclear purpose\u0097to inspire and build better\nlives and communities\u0097and we will endeavor to\nsupport candidates and initiatives that\nadvance this purpose in ways that unify us.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    41  \n                                 \nProposal 2\u0097Ratification of the Appointment of\nour Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm RESPONSIBILITIES The Audit Committee is\ndirectly responsible for the appointment,\ncompensation, retention and oversight of our\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nTo execute on this responsibility, the Audit\nCommittee engages in a comprehensive annual\nevaluation of the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u0092s qualifications,\nperformance and independence. The Audit\nCommittee has carefully considered the\nselection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n(\u0093PwC\u0094) as the independent registered public\naccounting firm to audit and report on the\nconsolidated financial statements of Truist\nand the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting. SHAREHOLDER\nRATIFICATION Our shareholders are being asked\nto ratify the appointment of PwC for 2022\nbecause we value our shareholders\u0092 views on\nour independent registered public accounting\nfirm and as a matter of good corporate\ngovernance. Representatives of PwC are\nexpected to be present at the annual meeting,\nwill have an opportunity to make a statement\nif they so desire and are expected to be\navailable to respond to questions posed by\nshareholders. If shareholders do not ratify\nthe decision of the Audit Committee to\nreappoint PwC as our independent registered\npublic accounting firm for 2022, the Audit\nCommittee will reconsider its decision.\nHowever, in view of the difficulty and expense\ninvolved in changing auditors on short notice,\nshould shareholders not ratify the selection\nof PwC, it is contemplated that the\nappointment of PwC will be permitted to stand\nunless the Audit Committee finds other\ncompelling reasons for making a change.\nDisapproval by the shareholders will likely be\nconsidered a recommendation that the Audit\nCommittee select another external auditor for\nthe following year.

Audit Committee Report The Audit\nCommittee of the Board of Directors is\ncurrently composed of eight independent\ndirectors and operates under a charter adopted\nby the Audit Committee on April 27, 2021. The\nSEC and the NYSE have established standards\nrelating to audit committee membership and\nfunctions. With regard to such membership\nstandards, the Board has determined that\nJennifer S.

Tanner and Steven C.\nVoorhees meet the requirements of an \u0093audit\ncommittee financial expert\u0094 as defined by the\nSEC. The primary duties and responsibilities\nof the Audit Committee are to assist the Board\nof Directors in monitoring: (i) the integrity\nof the financial statements of the Company;\n(ii) compliance by the Company with legal and\nregulatory requirements; (iii) the independent\nregistered public accounting firm\u0092s\nqualifications and independence; (iv) the\nCompany\u0092s internal controls and procedures;\nand (v) the performance of the Company\u0092s\ninternal audit function and the Company\u0092s\nindependent auditors. While the Audit\nCommittee has the duties and responsibilities\nset forth above and those set forth in its\ncharter, our management is responsible for the\ninternal controls and the financial reporting\nprocess, and the independent registered public\naccounting firm is responsible for performing\nan integrated audit of our financial\nstatements and of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting in\naccordance with standards established by the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and\nissuing a report thereon. In the performance\nof its oversight function, the Audit Committee\nhas performed the duties required by its\ncharter, including meeting and holding\ndiscussions with management, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm and the\ninternal auditor, and has reviewed and\ndiscussed the audited consolidated financial\nstatements with management and the independent\nregistered public accounting firm. The Audit\nCommittee has also discussed with the\nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nthe matters required to be discussed by the\napplicable requirements of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board and the SEC. In\naddition, the Audit Committee discussed with\nthe independent registered public accounting\nfirm its views on fraud risks and how it\ndemonstrates its independence.

The Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee and the Board believe\nthat our executive compensation program, as\ndescribed in the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis, reflects a pay-for-\nperformanceculture at Truist that is rooted in\nour values. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and the Board believe that the\nexecutive compensation program is well\ndesigned and effective in aligning the\ninterests of the executives with both the\nshort-term and long-term interests of our\nshareholders, while minimizing incentives for\nunnecessary and excessive risk taking. We hold\nthis advisory vote to approve our executive\ncompensation program annually, and our next\nadvisory vote regarding the frequency of these\nvotes will next be held at our 2023 annual\nmeeting. In making a decision on whether to\napprove our pay practices for our named\nexecutive officers, we ask that you consider\nthe description of our executive compensation\nprogram provided in the following pages in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis,\u0094 the\ncompensation tables and the accompanying\nnarratives. The Board strongly supports our\nexecutive pay practices and asks shareholders\nto support our executive compensation program\nthrough the following resolution: \u0093Resolved,\nthat the shareholders approve the compensation\npaid to Truist\u0092s named executive officers, as\ndescribed in the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis, the compensation tables and the\nrelated narrative disclosures in the Company\u0092s\n2022 Proxy Statement.\u0094 Your vote on this\nproposal, which is required by Section 14A of\nthe Exchange Act, is \u0093advisory\u0094 and will serve\nas a non-bindingrecommendation to the Board.\nThe Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nwill seriously consider the outcome of this\nvote when determining future executive\ncompensation arrangements.\n                                 \n  44    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The\nfollowing Compensation Discussion and Analysis\n(\u0093CD&A\u0094) discusses how, for 2021, we\ncompensated our named executive officers,\nwhich include the Chief Executive Officer\n(\u0093CEO\u0094) and each of the other executive\nofficers named in the 2021 Summary\nCompensation Table (the \u0093Named Executive\nOfficers\u0094 or \u0093NEOs\u0094).

Executive Leadership Changes in\n2021 and Impact to NEO Compensation In\nSeptember 2021, we made several Executive\nLeadership changes. As anticipated at the time\nof our merger of equals with SunTrust, Mr.\nKing transitioned to Executive Chairman and\nMr. Rogers assumed the CEO position in\nSeptember 2021. Other changes included the\nretirement of Chris Henson, Head of Banking\nand Insurance, the promotion of John Howard to\nthe role of Chief Insurance Officer, and the\npromotion of Hugh S. Cummins III to the role\nof Vice Chair. The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee (which we refer to in the\nCD&A as the \u0093Committee\u0094) considered these\nchanges to Executive Leadership in setting the\ncompensation of each of Messrs. Cummins and\nHoward.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    45  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis To\nrecognize his expanded responsibilities with\nhis appointment to Vice Chair and the\nimportance of ensuring continuity in\nleadership through the CEO transition, the\nCommittee increased Mr. Cummins\u0092 base salary\nand awarded Mr. Cummins an additional\npromotion and retention award, as more fully\ndescribed in the applicable sections of the\nCD&A. Prior to being promoted to Executive\nLeadership, Mr. Howard\u0092s compensation was\nbased on his role as Chairman and CEO of\nTruist Insurance Holdings, Inc. Upon being\nnamed to Truist\u0092s Executive Leadership team as\nChief Insurance Officer effective September 1,\n2021, the Committee made certain adjustments\nto his Annual Incentive Performance awards and\nLong-Term Incentive awards to properly align\nhis compensation structure with that of other\nExecutive Leadership team members and NEOs.\nThese adjustments for Mr. Howard are more\nfully described in the applicable sections of\nthe CD&A. Beginning in 2022, Mr. Howard will\nbe compensated in accordance with the\nexecutive compensation program applicable to\nTruist\u0092s other NEOs. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS For\nTruist, 2021 presented significant changes,\nopportunities and challenges for our\norganization. First, we saw leadership\nchanges, with the retirement of longtime\nTruist CEO, Kelly S. King. Mr. King, along\nwith William H. Rogers, Jr., was one of the\narchitects of the merger of equals between\nBB&T and SunTrust in 2019. Beginning in\nSeptember 2021, Mr. Rogers was named CEO of\nthe Company. Second, we showed solid financial\nperformance in 2021, highlighted by strong\nresults from investment banking, insurance,\nwealth and card and payment related fees, and\npositive trends in a number of other\nbusinesses given improving economic\nconditions. Finally, our Executive Leadership\nteam worked extensively together to forge a\ncommon resolve in managing adversity, creating\ninnovative solutions and maintaining our\nshared goals and vision of the merger while\nkeeping with Truist\u0092s Purpose, Mission and\nValues.

Highlights of the\ncompensation program are summarized below.\nFurther details on 2021 results and pay\ndecisions are provided in Section 3 below.\nBase Salaries\u0096 Aligned with organizational\nroles and market pay Base salaries provide the\nfoundational component of executive pay and\nreflect each executive\u0092s position and\nresponsibilities as well as consideration of\nmarket pay practices. Following a review of\ncompetitive market data provided by our\nindependent consultant, the Committee approved\nbase salaries for the leadership team,\nincluding NEOs.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    47  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Annual\nIncentive Performance Award\u0096 Rewards annual\nperformance goals tied to strategic plan The\nAnnual Incentive Performance (\u0093AIP\u0094) award was\ndeveloped to motivate and reward financial\nperformance and strategic initiatives that\ndefine our success following the merger,\nincluding related to our continuing\nintegration. The program includes a\ncombination of absolute and relative financial\nperformance as well as a qualitative\nassessment of performance on strategic\npriorities and other critical factors of our\nsuccess, as evaluated by the Committee.\nAbsolute Earnings Per Share (\u0093EPS\u0094) and\nRelative Return on Average Assets (\u0093ROAA\u0094)\nwere selected to measure growth, profitability\nand our return on investment. The Committee\nbelieves these metrics have a meaningful\nbearing on long-term increases in shareholder\nreturns and are valuable barometers of our\nperformance. The EPS and ROAA performance\npresented include adjustments to Truist\u0092s GAAP\nnet income by the Committee. For additional\ndetail regarding these adjustments, and the\ncalculation of EPS and ROAA, please refer to\nAnnex A. The Annual Incentive Performance\nawards also include a qualitative assessment\ncomponent. While the primary focus is on\nprofitability and returns to our shareholders,\nthe Committee also believes our annual\nincentive payouts should include a holistic\nreview of our performance that includes\nresults on our qualitative factors. The\nCommittee reviews the factors that form the\nqualitative assessment each year, making\nchanges as appropriate. For instance, ESG was\nadded as a factor in the qualitative\nassessment for 2021, reflecting the increased\nfocus on ESG matters within the Company and by\nour shareholders. Payout on EPS or ROAA is not\ndependent on meeting the other measure first;\neach measure is scored independently and the\nresults are then combined. In order to include\nthe qualitative assessment in determining the\nAIP, threshold performance must be met for\neither EPS or ROAA. If threshold performance\nis met for either EPS or ROAA, points awarded\nby the Committee for qualitative performance\nare then added to the combined EPS and ROAA\nscore. The Committee can adjust AIP payout due\nto unanticipated circumstances, market\nconditions or negative risk outcomes. Long-\nTerm Incentive Program\u0096 Rewards future\nperformance aligned with our shareholders The\nlong-term incentive program is intended to\nprovide a significant portion of executive pay\nopportunity based on our future performance\nand value creation to our shareholders. Under\nthis program, 65% of the long-term incentive\nopportunity is at risk based on our\nperformance (40% as performance unit (\u0093PSU\u0094)\nawards and 25% as a cash long-term incentive\nplan (\u0093LTIP\u0094)), and the remainder is provided\nthrough time-based restricted stock units\n(\u0093RSUs\u0094). The value of the cash LTIP and PSUs\nis based on three-year performance with\nrespect to the following metrics: Once an\nabsolute minimum level of ROATCE is achieved (\n\u22657%), vesting of the performance share units\nand LTIP cash are based on our ROACE and\nROATCE performance relative to our peers.\nThese metrics were selected by the Committee\nto reward performance viewed as important by\nour shareholders, and motivate strong\nprofitability that ultimately drives favorable\nshareholder returns.\n                                 \n  48    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n

In\n2021, our executive compensation program for\nour NEOs received approximately 95% approval\nby the Company\u0092s shareholders. The Committee\nconsidered these results in applying the same\ncompensation principles and adhering to the\ncore plan design, allowing for a balance\nbetween short and long-term incentives. 2021\nPay Program Mix The significant majority of\nour executive pay program is performance-\nbased. Approximately 92% of our CEO\u0092s pay is\nbased on performance and approximately 67% is\nbased on long-term performance.

Annual Incentive Performance\nAward and Payouts Program Summary: The AIP\naward was approved by the Committee based on\nits review of market and best practices. The\nAIP award is a cash incentive that rewards\npre-definedfinancial performance (measured by\nEPS and relative ROAA) as well as a holistic\nassessment of performance on strategic\npriorities. These are metrics that the\nCommittee believes are appropriate measures of\nshort-term performance. The AIP award is based\non the following three components: The\nfinancial performance goals are established\nannually by the Committee and include an\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) target goal based on\nour internal earnings plan and compares Return\non Average Assets (ROAA) based on our\nperformance relative to our peers. The\nQualitative Scorecard component is based on\nthe Committee\u0092s assessment of the attainment\nof key strategic priorities based on criteria\nestablished by the Committee. While payouts\nbased upon the EPS component and the ROAA\ncomponent are independent from one another, a\npayout under the qualitative performance\ncomponent requires the Company to meet\nthreshold performance on either the EPS\ncomponent or the ROAA component. Payouts under\neach component of our AIP can range from 0% to\n200% of the target award opportunity. EPS\ninterpolation used to establish awards is non-\nlinearand the slope increases moving away from\n\u0093Target\u0094 towards both \u0093Threshold\u0094 and\n\u0093Maximum\u0094.

Pay Decisions: After\ncalculating the results for EPS, ROAA, and\nassessing the qualitative performance\ncomponent, the Committee also considered\nwhether adjustments were needed due to overly\npositive results based on unanticipated\ncircumstances or negative risk outcomes and\ndetermined, after its analysis, that an\nadjustment was necessary for 2021. The\nCommittee concluded that due to several\nfactors outside of the Company\u0092s control,\nincluding released credit loss reserves that\nincreased earnings, and government mandated\nmoratoriums and stimulus that prevented or\ndelayed foreclosures and losses, the adjusted\nEPS component should be reduced to more\nappropriately capture the Company\u0092s core\nperformance. Please see Annex Afor a further\ndiscussion of the adjustments. After making\nthese adjustments, the Committee approved\nfunding AIP awards at 154% of target for each\nNEO. In summary, the AIP award payments to our\nNEOs for 2021 were as follows:\n                                              \n  K\u2026    Wi\u2026    Hu\u2026    C\u2026    Cl\u2026    D\u2026    Jo\u2026  \n  S.

Mr. Howard\u0092s PSUs for 2021 will be\nachieved based on the long-term components\nfrom the insurance incentive plan in effect\nfor him at Truist Insurance Holdings, prorated\nfor 9 months of 2021, and the Truist PSU\nelements as discussed below under \u0093Performance\nShare Units and LTIP Awards\u0094, prorated for\nthree months. The performance elements of the\ninsurance incentive plan are as follows: (i)\ninsurance organic revenue growth (50%); (ii)\ninsurance EBITDA margin (25%); and (iii)\ninsurance EBITDA growth (25%). PERFORMANCE\nSHARE UNITS AND LTIP AWARDS Nearly two-\nthirds(65%) of our long-term incentives are\nperformance-based, including our PSUs and LTIP\nawards. Awards provided as PSUs and under our\nLTIP program utilize the same metrics linking\npayouts to relative three-year ROACE and\nROATCE performance. The Committee chose ROACE\nand ROATCE as the performance measures for the\nlong-term incentive awards based on the belief\nthat they provide a balanced view of returns\ngenerated for shareholders. ROATCE is an\nimportant focus of investors in the banking\nindustry and reflects our ability to generate\nstrong returns on capital, thereby allowing us\nto make long-term investments on behalf of our\nstakeholders. The inclusion of ROACE ensures\nthat we also earn strong returns on the\ncapital deployed towards mergers and\nacquisitions (which often result in an\nincrease in goodwill and intangibles).\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    55  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The\nperformance goals and payout range are\nestablished at the beginning of the cycle (\ni.e., early 2021 for the 2021-2023 performance\nperiod). LTIP awards have historically been\npaid in cash, but at the discretion of the\nCommittee, may be paid in shares of Truist\ncommon stock, cash or both. Dividends are not\npaid on unvested PSUs or calculated into LTIP\npayments. The Committee also monitors whether\nour executive compensation program is\nconsistent with the safety and soundness of\nthe Company and considers whether our\nexecutive compensation program encourages\nunnecessary or excessive risk taking. The\nCommittee utilizes an executive risk scorecard\nthrough which compensation may be adjusted, if\nnecessary, for risk balancing purposes. See\nour disclosure under \u0093Executive Risk\nScorecard/Risk Adjustments\u0094 within this CD&A.\nPay Decisions: For 2021, the Committee granted\nPSUs and LTIP awards with the following\nfeatures:\n\n2021-2023 PSU and LTIP Awards (Granted in 2021\nand Fully Vest/Payable in 2024) Performance\nPeriod Three years Vesting Requirements and\nForfeiture Three-year cliff vesting through\nMarch 15, 2024, with 100% of the award being\nsubject to reduction or forfeiture if there is\nan aggregate operating loss for the\nperformance period or if a significant\nnegative risk outcome occurs as determined by\nthe Committee. Performance Metrics If the\nabsolute performance goal of an average ROATCE\nof 7% for the performance period is achieved,\nthe award payout for the performance period\nwill then be evaluated against the peer group\nbased upon (1) Truist ROATCE relative to the\npeer group ROATCE and (2) Truist ROACE\nrelative to the peer group ROACE. Each metric\nwill be scored independently, then weighted\nand added together. Payouts will be linearly\ninterpolated for achievement between\nthreshold, target, and maximum goals. Payout\nof these awards will be determined in early\n2024, based on the payout percentages for\nROACE and ROTCE indicated below.\n                                              \n                 Each\u00a0of\u00a0                     \n                 ROACE\u00a0and\u00a0      Payout\u00a0      \n                 ROATCE          percent\u00a0of   \n  Level          percentile\u00a0     target       \n                 performance     (for\u00a0each    \n                 relative        metric)      \n                 to\u00a0peer\u00a0                     \n                 group                        \n  Below          Below                        \n  Threshold      25th            0%           \n                 percentile                   \n  Threshold      25th            25%          \n                 percentile                   \n  Target         50th            50%          \n                 percentile                   \n  Maximum        75th or         75%          \n                 greater                      \n                                              \nDividend Treatment Dividends are not paid on\nunvested PSU and LTIP Awards\n                                 \n  56    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n\n2019-2021 PSU and LTIP Awards (Vested/Paid in\nMarch 2022) Vesting Requirements and\nForfeiture Three-year cliff vesting, with 100%\nof the award being subject to reduction or\nforfeiture if there is an aggregate operating\nloss for the performance period or if a\nsignificant negative risk outcome occurs as\ndetermined by the Committee. Performance\nMetric Relative Return on Common Equity\n(\u0093ROCE\u0094) against our peer group over the\nthree-year performance period. For 2019, the\nyear of grant, because of the closing of our\nmerger-of-equals,achievement of ROCE was based\non heritage BB&T\u0092s performance relative to our\npeers using results through September 30,\n2019, and the ROCE results for BB&T and the\npeer group were annualized for the remainder\nof the 2019 performance year. For 2020 and\n2021, performance was assumed at target level\nfor the ROCE goal. The award also requires our\nabsolute average ROCE to meet or exceed 3% for\nthe performance period. TSR Modifier Payouts\nare subject to a potential modifier (up to a\n20% increase or decrease) based on our Total\nShareholder Return (\u0093TSR\u0094), as illustrated\nbelow:\n                                              \n  Percentile                                  \n  Performance of         Percent Increase or  \n  Truist TSR Relative    Reduction in         \n  to                     Payout*              \n  Peer Group TSR                              \n  < 25th                 20%                  \n                         reduction            \n  50th                   No                   \n                         adjustment           \n  75th                   20% increase**       \n                                              \n* Modifications will be linearly interpolated\nfor results between the 25th and 75th\npercentiles. ** Subject to overall payout cap\nof 150% of target. Payout Prior to the merger,\nthe heritage BB&T Compensation Committee\ndetermined how the performance criteria should\nbe addressed in light of the impact the merger\nwould have on the comparability of our\nfinancial results to peers. For 2019, ROCE\nperformance of Truist relative to our peers\nwas annualized as of September 30, 2019, to\nreflect performance prior to the closing of\nthe merger. Our annualized 2019 ROCE of 11.76%\nplaced us in the 75th percentile among peers\nresulting in a ROCE outcome of 149.8% for the\n2019 performance year. Due to the timing of\nthe merger, target level performance was\nassumed for 2020 and 2021 resulting in a ROCE\noutcome of 100% for each of those years. The\nCommittee determined that the relative TSR\nmodifier would be based on the full 2019-2021\nperformance period. Based on this approach,\npayouts for the 2019-2021 PSU and LTIP awards\nwere as follows:\n                                              \n  Rel\u2026                                        \n  ROCE    Payo\u2026    Relat\u2026    Adju\u2026    Actual  \n  Per\u2026    as       TSR\u00a0      for      Payout  \n  and     % of     Perfo\u2026    TSR      Perce\u2026  \n  Per\u2026    Targ\u2026    (2019\u2026    Perf\u2026            \n  (20\u2026                                        \n  11.\u2026             31st                       \n  or               perce\u2026                     \n  the              (trig\u2026                     \n  75th    116.\u2026    negat\u2026    -14.\u2026    99.13%  \n  per\u2026             TSR\u00a0                       \n  for              adjus\u2026                     \n  201\u2026                                        \n                                              \n(1) Due to the impact of the merger,\nrepresents annualized 2019 ROCE of 11.76%, or\nthe 75th percentile, and target level\nperformance for 2020 and 2021.

The\nCommittee determined that the performance\ncriteria for these awards were met and the\nawards vested in March 2022. The Committee\nbelieves that with the significant proportion\nof the NEOs\u0092 long-term incentive compensation\ncurrently consisting of equity, including the\nvesting of the PSUs from these awards, and in\nlight of the substantial Truist common stock\nholdings of each of our NEOs, it was\nappropriate to pay the 2019-2021 LTIP awards\nin cash.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    57  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUs) RSUs complement\nother elements in our executive compensation\nprogram and are designed to reward\nsustainable, long-term appreciation of our\nstock price over the vesting period and focus\non stock ownership and retention objectives.\nPay Decisions: For 2021, the Committee granted\nRSUs with the following features: 2021 RSU\nAwards Vesting Period The RSUs vest in 1/3\nincrements over 4 years for all NEOs,\nbeginning on March 15 following the second\nanniversary of the grant date. Vesting\nRequirements and Forfeiture The 2021 RSUs are\nsubject to reduction or forfeiture if Truist\nhas incurred an annual operating loss for the\nyear or the Committee determines that there\nhas been a significant negative risk outcome\nas a result of a corporate or individual\naction. Dividend Treatment Dividends are not\npaid on unvested RSUs. ADDITIONAL AWARDS\nVesting of Synergy Incentive Awards: In\nconnection with the significant integration\nplanning for the merger and the criticality of\nretaining key talent at both BB&T and SunTrust\nthrough the integration process, retention\nincentive awards were granted to Messrs.\nBible, Henson and Starnes prior to the closing\nof the merger. The heritage BB&T Compensation\nCommittee granted one-time awards(the \u0093synergy\nincentive awards\u0094) designed to facilitate\ncontinuity and retention of the executives\nresponsible for critical roles and to reward\nthe significant transition requirements of\nsuch a large merger. Pursuant to the terms of\nthe synergy incentive awards, 33% of the award\nwas paid on August 13, 2021, in the amounts of\n$1,036,800, $1,387,500, and $1,036,800 to\nMessrs. Bible, Henson and Starnes,\nrespectively. The remaining amounts of the\nsynergy incentive awards vested in January\n2022. Mr. Cummins\u0092 Promotion and Retention\nAward: In connection with Mr. Cummins\u0092\npromotion to Vice Chair, the Committee granted\nseparate three- and five-year retention awards\nto Mr. Cummins for the purpose of maintaining\nleadership continuity over this period.

Mr.\nHoward\u0092s legacy employment agreement continued\nafter the merger of equals. Under the terms of\nthe agreement, subject to his continued\nemployment, principal and interest due by Mr.\nHoward on the note was forgiven in annual\nincrements of $225,000, through the sixth\nanniversary of the note agreement. The final\nincrement was forgiven on December 31, 2021.\nLimited Perquisites Our NEOs receive limited\nperquisites and other personal benefits that\nthe Committee believes are reasonable and\nconsistent with our overall executive\ncompensation program. Such perquisites\ngenerally include, but are not limited to,\nresidential security services, executive\nphysical wellness examinations, occasional use\nof sports tickets, spousal participation in\ncertain corporate events, and for individuals\nserving as our Chief Executive Officer or\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, limited\npersonal use of the company aircraft and\ndriver.

The Committee believes that  \n    the benefits provided by the Excess Plan  \n    ensure that we will maximize the          \n    retention benefits of the Pension Plan.   \n                                              \n                                              \n    The Pension Plan and the Excess Plan are  \n    broad-based benefits, and the NEOs        \n    participate in both plans on the same     \n    basis as                                  \n    other similarly situated teammates.       \n                                              \n                                              \n    The Pension Plan and the Excess Plan      \n    provide retirement benefits based on      \n    length of service and cash compensation   \n    level                                     \n    prior to retirement with benefits         \n    generally increasing substantially as a   \n    participant approaches retirement.        \n                                              \n                                              \n    We believe the retirement benefits        \n    provided by the Pension Plan are          \n    meaningful to all teammates, but          \n    especially to those                       \n    who have devoted substantial service to   \n    Truist.                                   \n                                              \nMoreover, we view the Pension Plan and the\nExcess Plan as important retention tools for\nthe NEOs and other highly compensated\nteammates. These retirement benefits could not\neasily be replicated upon the teammate\u0092s\ndeparture from Truist prior to retirement. The\nCommittee believes that while the overall\nretirement benefits provided to the NEOs are\nreasonable relative to those provided by its\npeer group, the Pension Plan and Excess Plan\nprovide us with a competitive advantage in\nattracting and retaining talent in light of\nthe high number of companies that have frozen\nor abandoned traditional pension plans in\nrecent years. BENEFIT PLANS During 2021, we\nmaintained various teammate benefit plans that\nconstitute a portion of the total compensation\npackage available to the NEOs and all eligible\nteammates of Truist. These plans consist of\nthe following:\n                                              \n    the Truist Financial Corporation 401(k)   \n    Savings Plan, which in 2021 permitted     \n    teammates to contribute up to 50% of      \n    their                                     \n    cash compensation, on a tax-deferred, or  \n    after tax basis, within certain IRS       \n    compensation deferral amount limits       \n    applicable to tax-qualified retirement    \n    plans, with                               \n    Truist matching deferrals up to 6% of     \n    their compensation;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    the Truist Financial Corporation          \n    Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan,  \n    which is                                  \n    designed to augment the benefits under    \n    the Truist Financial Corporation 401(k)   \n    Savings Plan to the extent such benefits  \n    are curtailed by the application of       \n    certain limits imposed by the Internal    \n    Revenue Code (during 2021, eligible       \n    participants in                           \n    the Non-Qualified Defined Contribution    \n    Plan were permitted to defer up to 50%    \n    of their cash compensation with certain   \n    participants eligible to receive a        \n    matching contribution of up to 6% of      \n    their                                     \n    compensation);                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    a medical plan that provides coverage     \n    for all eligible teammates;               \n                                              \n                                              \n    disability insurance which, in the event  \n    of disability, pays a teammate 50% of     \n    his or her monthly compensation, subject  \n    to                                        \n    a cap of $35,000 per month; however, if   \n    the coverage percentage exceeds the       \n    monthly cap, we would provide             \n    supplemental payments to a member of      \n    Executive Leadership to bring the         \n    monthly payment up to the percentage      \n    coverage level; and                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    certain other teammate benefits (such as  \n    sick leave, vacation, dental and vision   \n    coverage, etc.).                          \n                                              \nThe teammate benefits for the NEOs discussed\nin this subsection are determined by the same\ncriteria applicable to all of our teammates.\nIn general, benefits are designed to provide a\nsafety net of protection against the financial\ncatastrophes that can result from illness,\ndisability or death, and to provide a\nreasonable level of retirement income based on\nyears of service with Truist. These benefits\nare part of the strong value proposition we\noffer our teammates in furtherance of our\npurpose, and help keep us competitive in\nattracting and retaining teammates. We believe\nthat our teammate benefits are generally on\npar with benefits provided by our peer group\nand consistent with industry standards.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    59  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Section\n4\u0097Executive Compensation Process\u0097Decision\nInputs and Roles Decision Making Calendar 2021\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROCESS \u0096 COMPENSATION\nAND HUMAN CAPITAL COMMITTEE\n                                              \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Review                  \n                    executive risk scorecard  \n                    for the prior year \u0095\u2002\u2009     \n                    Receive reports from the  \n                    General                   \n                    Auditor regarding risk    \n                    management and internal   \n                    control effectiveness \u0095\u2002   \n                    Approve                   \n                    financial results and     \n                    adjustments for           \n                    incentive plans \u0095\u2002\u2009        \n                    Determine                 \n                    payments/vesting for      \n                    incentive plans with      \n  First Quarter     performance periods       \n                    completed the prior year  \n                    (AIP, LTIP, PSUs and      \n                    RSUs) \u0095\u2002\u2009Approve peer      \n                    group for the current     \n                    year                      \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Set financial targets   \n                    and performance measures  \n                    for the current year to   \n                    determine                 \n                    AIP awards, LTIP and      \n                    PSUs \u0095\u2002\u2009Set compensation   \n                    for current year \u0096 base    \n                    salary, short term and    \n                    long term incentive       \n                    targets \u0095\u2002\u2009Review tally    \n                    sheets                    \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Review projected        \n  Second            financial results with    \n  Quarter           proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive                 \n                    plans                     \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Conduct a\u00a0mid-year\u00a0     \n                    review of                 \n                    current executive risk    \n                    scorecard \u0095\u2002\u2009Review        \n                    projected financial       \n                    results with              \n  Third             proposed adjustments for  \n  Quarter           incentive plans \u0095\u2002\u2009Review  \n                    of Executive Leadership   \n                    compensation with the     \n                    Compensation Committee\u0092s   \n                    independent compensation  \n                    consultant, Meridian      \n                    Compensation Partners     \n                    \u0095\u2002\u2009Review projected        \n                    financial results with    \n  Fourth Quarter    proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive plans \u0095\u2002\u2009        \n                    Conduct annual review of  \n                    director compensation     \n                                              \nPeer Group and Competitive Analyses The\nCommittee uses a peer group to perform\ncompetitive assessments of executive\ncompensation as well as to measure performance\nunder our short- and long-term incentive\nplans. The Committee approves a group of\npublicly-traded banks or financial services\nholding companies each year to serve as the\npeer group. The Committee selected a peer\ngroup in 2020 and re-evaluatedthat peer group\nin February 2021. The Committee concluded that\ncontinued use of this peer group was\nappropriate for 2021. The Committee considered\na number of factors, including the industry,\nbusiness mix, asset size and market\ncapitalization, and regulatory oversight. The\nCommittee acknowledged the challenges\nselecting peer companies as Truist is among\nthe largest regional banks in the United\nStates and there are only a few other regional\nbanks meeting the criteria. After discussion,\nthe Committee determined that the following\ncompanies would be used for competitive pay\nbenchmarking and to determine the relative\nperformance comparisons in our short- and\nlong-term incentive awards.\n                                              \n       TRU\u2026                                   \n       2021                                   \n       PEER                                   \n       GRO\u2026                                   \n               Ass\u2026             Ma\u2026           \n  Co\u2026          ($\u00a0              Ca\u2026           \n  Na\u2026          in\u00a0              ($            \n               mil\u2026             in            \n                                mi\u2026           \n  JP\u2026                $3,\u2026            $392     \n  Ch\u2026                                         \n  Ba\u2026                                         \n  of                 $2,\u2026            $256     \n  Am\u2026                                         \n  We\u2026                $1,\u2026            $124     \n  Fa\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                   $               $     \n  Ba\u2026                 554              65     \n  Tr\u2026                   $               $     \n  Fi\u2026                 509              65     \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  PNC                   $               $     \n  Fi\u2026                 467              61     \n  Fi\u2026                   $               $     \n  Th\u2026                 205              21     \n  Ci\u2026                   $               $     \n  Fi\u2026                 183              16     \n  Key                   $               $     \n  Co\u2026                 170              16     \n  Re\u2026                   $               $     \n                      147              16     \n  M&T                   $               $     \n                      143              17     \n  Tr\u2026                                         \n  Fi\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                  61  %           67  %  \n  pe\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n                                              \n* Data sourced from S&P Capital IQ, effective\n1/31/2021\n                                 \n  60    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The\ncompensation structure for Executive\nLeadership, which includes the NEOs,\nemphasizes variable pay based on performance.\nWe generally compare each element of\ncompensation as well as total compensation\nrelative to the peer group. In establishing\ntarget pay opportunities, the Committee\nreviews market data from our peers as well as\nother financial services firms. The Committee\nestablishes pay levels for each executive that\nare appropriate based on market data as well\nas other critical factors including each\nexecutive\u0092s specific role, performance,\nexperience, expertise, internal pay\ncomparisons and relative responsibilities of\nthe Executive Leadership team. In addition to\nthe external peer group analysis, the\nCommittee also reviews detailed tally sheets\nfor each executive and compares the total\ncompensation for each member of the Executive\nLeadership team relative to one another. This\npractice is consistent with our compensation\nphilosophy of rewarding our teammates based\nupon their level of responsibility within the\nCompany. Regulatory Considerations in Setting\nCompensation Banking regulators have provided\ninput on and influenced the compensation\npractices and incentive compensation at the\nlargest financial institutions in the United\nStates, focusing on the risks intrinsic to the\ndesign and implementation of compensation\nplans as well as the reasonableness of each\nelement of compensation. Regulatory guidance\nis considered in the design and implementation\nof our executive compensation programs. The\nCommittee continues to assess our pay\npractices to balance risks and meeting\nstakeholder expectations with our commitment\nto link NEO pay to our performance while\nmaintaining executive compensation programs\nthat are market competitive and shareholder\naligned. Role of Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee The Committee administers\nTruist\u0092s compensation program for Executive\nLeadership, including each of the NEOs, in a\nmanner consistent with our Purpose, Mission,\nand Values. The Committee\u0092s authority and\nresponsibilities are set forth in its charter\nand include but are not limited to:\n                                              \n    reviewing and approving the compensation  \n    for the Chief Executive Officer, the      \n    remaining NEOs and other members of       \n    Executive Leadership;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n    selecting and approving the performance   \n    metrics and goals for the executive       \n    compensation program and evaluating       \n    performance at the end of each            \n    performance period;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    approving award opportunities for our     \n    AIP awards, PSUs, RSUs and LTIP awards;   \n                                              \n                                              \n    reviewing the executive risk scorecard    \n    for Executive Leadership; and             \n                                              \n                                              \n    conducting an annual review of director   \n    compensation.                             \n                                              \nIn making compensation decisions, the\nCommittee uses several resources and tools,\nincluding the services of the Committee\u0092s\nindependent compensation consultant, Meridian\nCompensation Partners, LLC (\u0093Meridian\u0094). The\nCommittee also considers summary analyses of\ntotal compensation delineating each\ncompensation element (\u0093tally sheets\u0094), an\nexecutive risk scorecard provided by our Chief\nRisk Officer, competitive benchmarking, a\nreview of the Company\u0092s internal control\neffectiveness, and other analyses. Performance\nAdjustments The Committee retains discretion\nto make adjustments to our performance, as\nwell as the reported results from members of\nour peer group, for purposes of making\nperformance-based compensation awards.\n                                              \n    Throughout the year, the Committee        \n    reviews projected results and items for   \n    possible adjustment. At the beginning of  \n    each                                      \n    year, the Committee receives final        \n    performance information for the prior     \n    year, and historically has made           \n    adjustments to our reported results       \n    (e.g., net income) to ensure that the     \n    applicable compensatory plans fairly      \n    compensate participants for core          \n    Truist performance.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    The Committee may also make adjustments   \n    to the reported performance of peer       \n    group members for awards that measure     \n    our                                       \n    performance relative to the peer group.   \n                                              \n                                              \n    A reconciliation of adjustments that the  \n    Committee made for the purposes of        \n    certifying 2021 performance is included   \n    in                                        \n    Annex\u00a0A to this proxy statement.          \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated, discussions of\n2021 performance for compensation purposes in\nthis proxy statement include these adjustments\nmade by the Committee.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    61  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Role of\nManagement in Compensation Decisions The\nCommittee periodically receives reports from\nour General Auditor, the head of our internal\naudit function, regarding our internal\ncontrols. The purpose of these reports and\nreview is to allow the Committee to evaluate\nour current risk environment and internal\ncontrol positions relevant to incentive\ncompensation, and to take these issues into\nconsideration when determining incentive\ncompensation. The Chief Executive Officer is\nalso involved in compensation determinations\nfor members of Executive Leadership, other\nthan himself, including compensation for each\nof the other NEOs, and makes recommendations\nto the Committee on base salary and the other\ncompensation elements. We believe that the\nChief Executive Officer is in the best\nposition to assess the performance of other\nmembers of Executive Leadership, and\naccordingly, he plays an important role in the\ncompensation setting process. Ultimately,\nhowever, decisions about individual\ncompensation elements and total compensation\nof all members of Executive Leadership are\nmade by the Committee, based primarily on the\nexecutive\u0092s performance and our overall\nperformance, with consideration of the\nbusiness environment in which the results were\nachieved. In addition, the compensation of the\nChief Risk Officer is made in consultation\nwith the Risk Committee. Role of Compensation\nConsultant The Committee engages an\nindependent compensation consultant to provide\nmarket reference perspective and serve as an\nadvisor. The independent compensation\nconsultant serves at the request of, and\nreports directly to, the Committee. Further,\nthe Committee has the sole authority to\napprove the independent compensation\nconsultant\u0092s fees and other retention terms,\nincluding the authority to limit the amount of\nfees the independent compensation consultant\nmay earn from other services provided to\nTruist. The Committee has retained Meridian to\nact as the Committee\u0092s independent\ncompensation consultant. In this capacity,\nMeridian performed a review of our executive\ncompensation programs, provided peer group\nanalyses, and advised on regulatory\ndevelopments, corporate governance and best\npractice trends. The Committee determined\nthat, based on its review, Meridian is\nindependent and that its engagement did not\npresent any conflicts of interest. In making\nthis determination, the Committee noted that\nMeridian (a) provides no services to Truist\nother than compensation consulting, (b) has no\npersonal or business relationships with\nmembers of our Board or executive officers,\n(c) does not directly own any shares of Truist\nstock, and (d) retains a written policy\ndesigned to avoid conflicts of interest that\nmay arise. Meridian also determined that it\nwas independent from our management and\nconfirmed this in a written statement provided\nto the Chair of the Committee. During 2021,\nthe compensation consultant provided the\nfollowing services to the Committee:\n                                              \n    reviewed our company\u0092s total compensation  \n    philosophy for reasonableness and         \n    appropriateness;                          \n                                              \n                                           \n    reviewed overall compensation levels;  \n                                           \n                                              \n    reviewed our total executive              \n    compensation program relative to peers    \n    and advised the Committee of plans or     \n    practices that                            \n    may be changed to improve effectiveness;  \n                                              \n                                              \n    provided market and peer data and         \n    recommendations on Executive Leadership   \n    compensation;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n    reviewed and advised the Committee on     \n    the composition of our peer group;        \n                                              \n                                              \n    reviewed public disclosure on             \n    compensation, including the draft CD&A    \n    and related tables and compensation       \n    disclosures                               \n    for our proxy statement; and              \n                                              \n                                              \n    advised the Committee regarding the       \n    compensation of outside directors.        \n                                              \nIn order for a compensation consultant to\nprovide effective advice, the Committee\nexpects them to interact with our management\nfrom time to time. These interactions\ngenerally involve, among other things:\n                                              \n    obtaining compensation and benefits       \n    data, as well as other relevant           \n    information that is not available from    \n    public sources;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n    working with management to understand     \n    the scope of the various executive jobs   \n    in order to provide accurate              \n    benchmarking;                             \n    and                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    conferring with management to ensure      \n    advice is grounded in our business        \n    strategy and circumstances.               \n                                              \nThis process enables the compensation\nconsultant to identify any areas where further\nresearch or analysis may be necessary, while\nallowing it to discuss any changes to the\nexecutive compensation program or refine\nrecommendations before finalizing its reports\nto the Committee.\n                                 \n  62    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis EXECUTIVE\nRISK SCORECARD/RISK ADJUSTMENTS We utilize an\nexecutive risk scorecard, which the Committee\nmay use to adjust, if necessary, the short-\nterm and long-term incentive compensation of\neach member of Executive Leadership (including\nthe NEOs). The executive risk scorecard:\n                                              \n    allows for evaluation of both corporate   \n    and individual results that can be        \n    compared to stated risk appetites in all  \n    risk                                      \n    categories;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n    presents the positive and negative risk   \n    outcomes that have influenced each risk   \n    category, if necessary, and includes      \n    recommended actions with respect to       \n    significant negative outcomes;            \n                                              \n                                              \n    is used in conjunction with the           \n    recommendations of the Chief Risk         \n    Officer, the CEO and the Compensation     \n    and Human Capital                         \n    Committee\u0092s own insight and evaluation;    \n                                              \n                                              \n    is included as part of our risk review    \n    process in which 100% of each Executive   \n    Leader\u0092s short-term and long-term          \n    incentive compensation for 2021 was       \n    subject to potential adjustment; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n    is reviewed by the independent            \n    compensation consultant.                  \n                                              \nThe Committee believes that the executive risk\nscorecard is an important element to ensure\nthat incentive compensation at the Executive\nLeadership level is risk-balanced. The use of\nthis risk scorecard has been discussed with\nour regulators as an additional way to conform\nto incentive compensation guidance and best\npractices. Section 5\u0097Other Compensation and\nBenefits Policies and Practices In addition to\nthe key components of our executive\ncompensation program described above, other\nsignificant policies, plans and factors\ninfluence executive compensation, including\nthe compensation of the NEOs. These policies\nand practices ensure strong governance of our\nexecutive compensation program and promote\nalignment of our executives\u0092 interests with\nthose of shareholders. Compensation Practices\nand the Impact on Risk Management We expect\nall members of our Executive Leadership team\nto exhibit the highest levels of ethics and\ndemonstrate best practices to discourage\nunnecessary or excessive risk taking when\nconducting activities on behalf of Truist. The\nCommittee annually considers whether our\nexecutive compensation program encourages\nunnecessary or excessive risk taking. In\nreviewing the program for risk, the goal of\nthe Committee is to design an executive\ncompensation program to encourage prudent risk\nmanagement and discourage inappropriate risk-\ntaking by granting a diverse portfolio of\ncompensation to our NEOs that is expected to\nreward the creation of shareholder value over\ntime. When determining incentive compensation,\nand consistent with regulatory guidance, the\nCommittee evaluates our current risk\nenvironment and internal control structure\nrelevant to incentive compensation and reviews\nan executive risk scorecard and other reports.\nThe Committee also receives reports from our\nGeneral Auditor, the head of Truist\u0092s internal\naudit function, regarding the effectiveness of\nour overall system of internal controls.\nBALANCE BETWEEN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM\nCOMPENSATION ELEMENTS The Committee believes\nthat having market-competitive fixed base\nsalaries discourages inappropriate risk-\ntaking. In addition, executives have a\nsignificant proportion of compensation\nprovided in the form of equity awards, such as\nPSUs and RSUs that have performance and\nvesting features that extend over several\nyears. Additionally, LTIP awards are based on\nour performance over a three-year period,\nencouraging our NEOs to focus on long-term\nperformance, rather than just annual results,\nand further reducing risk-taking that is\nlikely to produce only short-term benefits and\nallowing sufficient time for risk outcomes to\nemerge. USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT\nADJUST FOR RISK To help encourage prudent risk\nmanagement, the Committee considers the risk\nprofile of the primary compensation elements.\nUnder our incentive programs, we use\nperformance metrics that closely correlate to\nshareholder return. Similarly, our incentive\nprograms include measures that adjust for\nrisk, including the use of the executive risk\nscorecard. CLAWBACK AND FORFEITURE PROVISIONS\nOur clawback and forfeiture provisions also\ndiscourage imprudent risk-taking. Our 2012\nIncentive Plan, which is the plan pursuant to\nwhich we make all of our AIP, PSU, LTIP and\nRSU awards, and related award agreements\ncontain broad language regarding clawbacks and\nmake all awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan\nsubject to recoupment, forfeiture or reduction\nto the extent determined by the Committee, as\nnecessary to comply with applicable law or\nTruist\u0092s policies. Our award agreements also\nallow the Committee to adjust the terms and\nconditions of the awards in recognition of\ncertain events, including material restatement\nof our financial statements, to prevent\ndilution or enlargement of benefits intended\nto be made under the applicable plan. Our\nTruist Financial Corporation 2022 Incentive\nPlan that we are proposing to adopt in\nProposal 4 has substantially similar clawback\nlanguage. Our Board believes that the current\nstructure of Truist\u0092s incentive compensation\nrecoupment practices is appropriate,\neffective, provides a balanced approach to\nrisk management, and properly aligns the\ninterests of our Executive Leadership and\nshareholders.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    63  \n                                 \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis STOCK\nOWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS The Committee believes\nthat members of Executive Leadership,\nincluding the NEOs, should accumulate\nmeaningful equity stakes in Truist over time\nto further align their economic interests with\nthe interests of shareholders, thereby\npromoting our objective of increasing\nshareholder value. We have robust stock\nownership requirements to ensure that our\nexecutives have significant value tied to\nlong-term stock price performance which\ndiscourages a focus on short-term results and\nimprudent risk-taking. In accordance with our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, our CEO is\nrequired to own Truist stock having a value\nequal to at least 6x his base salary, while\nall other members of Executive Leadership are\nrequired to own Truist stock having a value of\nat least 3x their base salary. The Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines require the minimum\nlevel of ownership to be met by the later of\n(i) five years after initially joining\nExecutive Leadership, or (ii) such period of\ntime as it takes to reach the ownership\nrequirement by continuously holding the shares\nor RSUs granted by Truist pursuant to its\nequity compensation arrangements. Each member\nof Executive Leadership currently meets these\nrequirements as applicable to him or her\n(whether by owning the required amount of\nshares or still being within the grace period\nto achieve such ownership level). RESPONSIBLE\nEQUITY GRANT PRACTICES Generally, the timing\nof our regular annual equity awards is\ndetermined months in advance of the actual\ngrants in order to coincide with the regular\nFebruary meetings of the Board and the\nCommittee. The grant date is established when\nthe grants and all key terms are approved by\nthe Board or the Committee, as the case may\nbe. For the 2021 PSU and RSU awards, the\nCommittee used the closing price of our common\nstock on the grant date to determine the\nnumber of PSU and RSU awards. In addition, the\n2012 Incentive Plan (and our proposed 2022\nIncentive Plan) includes prohibitions on the\nrepricing of stock options without shareholder\napproval. We are required to recognize the\nexpense of all share-based awards (such as\nPSUs and RSUs) in our income statement over\nthe award\u0092s minimum required service period.\nPledging/Hedging of Shares Our Code of Ethics\nfor Teammates prohibits all teammates from\nspeculative trading in Truist securities\n(including prohibitions on short-selling and\ntrading put options). Our Securities Trades by\nCompany Personnel Policy prohibits Section 16\nreporting persons, which include directors and\nmembers of Executive Leadership, from engaging\nin hedging transactions (including short\nsales, trading in puts, calls, and other\noptions or derivatives). Teammates who are not\nSection 16 reporting persons are prohibited\nfrom engaging in hedging transactions, other\nthan transactions that hedge against an\nexisting long position in Truist securities if\nthe shares underlying the position are readily\navailable for sale or delivery and the\nexercise or strike price of the hedge is above\nthe then-current market price of the shares.\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit\nthe pledging of Truist shares by directors and\nmembers of Executive Leadership. Currently,\nnone of our directors or Executive Leadership\nmembers hold Truist shares that are subject to\npledges or hedges. Tax Considerations Prior to\n2018, our compensation philosophy and policies\nwere intended to comply with Section 162(m) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, which generally\ndisallowed a federal income tax deduction for\ncompensation over $1 million paid for any\nfiscal year to the Chief Executive Officer and\nspecified other executive officers, subject to\nexceptions for \u0093performance-based\u0094\ncompensation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of\n2017 eliminated this exception for\nperformance-based compensation, and the\nCompany may no longer take an annual deduction\nfor any compensation paid to any of its\ncovered employees in excess of $1 million per\nexecutive officer. Due to the continued\nimportance and benefit to the Company and our\nshareholders of awarding compensation that is\nstructured to properly incentivize our\nexecutive officers, the Committee believes\nthat it is in our best interests to retain\nflexibility in awarding compensation, even if\nsome awards may be non-deductiblecompensation\nexpenses to the Company. Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee Report on Executive\nCompensation The Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee is composed entirely of non-\nemployeedirectors, each of whom has been\ndetermined in the Board\u0092s business judgment to\nbe independent based on the categorical\nstandards for independence adopted by the\nBoard, which include the applicable NYSE\nindependence standards. The Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee is responsible for\noversight and review of our compensation and\nbenefit plans, including administering our\nexecutive incentive plans, determining the\ncompensation for the Chief Executive Officer\nand reviewing and approving the compensation\nfor the other members of Executive Leadership.\nThe Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nsection of this proxy statement is\nmanagement\u0092s report on Truist\u0092s executive\ncompensation program and, among other things,\nexplains the material elements of the\ncompensation paid to the Chief Executive\nOfficer and the other NEOs.

For a\ndiscussion of the valuation methods and\nmaterial assumptions applied in quantifying\nthe present value of the current accrued\nbenefit under each of these plans, as set\nforth in the table above, please refer to Note\n15 \u0093Benefit Plans\u0094 in the \u0093Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements\u0094 included\nwith the Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, and filed with\nthe SEC on February 23, 2022. A discussion of\neach of these plans is set forth below. Mr.\nRogers participated in several plans assumed\nin the merger with SunTrust. Those plans have\nprovisions which differ from the Truist plans\ndiscussed below. The Company merged the\nSunTrust qualified plan into the Truist\nqualified plan in 2020. Mr. Rogers and Mr.\nCummins continue to participate in the\nSunTrust ERISA Excess Plan and Mr. Rogers\ncontinues to participate in the SunTrust\nBanks, Inc. Tier 2 SERP, although any future\nbenefit accruals will come only from the\nTruist qualified and nonqualified plans as\nbenefit accruals under these heritage SunTrust\nplans were frozen prior to the merger. Tax-\nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan. The Pension\nPlan is a tax-qualifieddefined benefit pension\nplan for eligible teammates. Most teammates of\nTruist and its subsidiaries who have attained\nage 21 are eligible to participate in the\nPension Plan after completing one year of\nservice. Our contributions to the Pension Plan\nare computed on an actuarial basis. No\nparticipant contributions are permitted. A\nparticipant\u0092s annual normal retirement benefit\nunder the Pension Plan at age 65 is an amount\nequal to 1.0% of the participant\u0092s final\naverage compensation plus 0.5% of the\nparticipant\u0092s final average compensation in\nexcess of Social Security covered\ncompensation, multiplied by the number of\nyears of creditable service completed up to a\nmaximum of 35 years. A participant\u0092s final\naverage compensation is his or her average\nannual cash compensation, including salary,\nwages, overtime, bonuses and incentive\ncompensation, for the five consecutive years\nin the last ten years in which he or she\nreceives compensation that produces the\nhighest average.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    71  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers Non-\nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan.The Non-\nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan is an excess\nbenefit plan designed to provide supplemental\npension benefits for certain highly\ncompensated teammates, including the NEOs, to\nthe extent that their benefits under the\nPension Plan are curtailed due to IRS\ncompensation and benefit limitations. Benefits\nunder the Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan\nare included in the table above.\nRetirement.Messrs. King, Rogers, Cummins,\nHenson, Starnes and Bible meet or have met the\nrequirements for retirement under the Pension\nPlan and the Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit\nPlan. Mr. Howard has also met the requirements\nfor the retirement under the Non-Qualified\nDefined Benefit Plan. While the general\nretirement age is 65, teammates with at least\n10 years of service who have attained age 55\nare eligible to retire and begin receiving a\nreduced pension immediately. If a teammate\nbegins pension payments prior to the normal\nretirement age of 65, the payments are reduced\nbased on a plan-specified reduction schedule\nranging from receipt of 50% at age 55,\nincreasing until reaching 98% at age 64, with\nthe increases weighted more heavily toward the\nearlier years. Generally, pension benefits\nunder each plan are paid to qualifying\nparticipants in the form of a life annuity for\nnon-marriedparticipants and a joint and 50%\nsurvivor annuity for married participants.\n2021 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation\n                                              \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \u2026      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \u0097       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \u0097       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \u0097       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \u0097       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \u0097       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \u0097       6\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         Executive contributions were based   \n         on each NEO\u0092s deferral elections and  \n         the salaries, Annual Incentive       \n  (1)    Performance award, Business          \n         Incentive Plan award, and LTIP       \n         payments received by each NEO in     \n         2021.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n         This column represents Truist\u0092s       \n         matching contributions credited to   \n         the accounts of the NEOs during      \n  (2)    2021 in respect of the NEO\u0092s          \n         contributions.

During 2021, eligible teammates\nwere permitted to defer up to 50% of their\ncash compensation under the Non-\nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan, with\ncertain participants, including each NEO,\neligible to receive a matching contribution up\nto 6% of his or her compensation. All cash\ncompensation is eligible for deferral unless\nprohibited under Internal Revenue Code Section\n409A. Plan participants may select deemed\ninvestment funds under the Non-\nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan that are\nidentical to the investment funds offered\nunder the 401(k) Plan with the exception that\nno deemed investments in Truist common stock\nare permitted. Participants make an election\nupon entering the Non-QualifiedDefined\nContribution Plan regarding the timing of plan\ndistributions. The two allowable distribution\nelections are distribution upon termination or\ndistribution based on a selected age following\ntermination not to exceed age 65. The Non-\nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan also allows\nfor an in-servicehardship withdrawal based on\nfacts and circumstances that meet IRS\nguidelines. The Non-QualifiedDefined\nContribution Plan also provides participants\nin our incentive compensation plans with an\neffective means of electing to defer, on a\npre-taxbasis, a portion of the payments that\nthey are entitled to receive under such plans.\n                                 \n  72    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers Potential\nPayments Upon Termination or Change of Control\nThe potential payments to the NEOs pursuant to\nexisting plans and arrangements in the event\nof their termination or a change of control at\nDecember 31, 2021 are shown in the table\nbelow.

The\nactual amounts to be paid can only be\ndetermined at the time of a NEO\u0092s termination\nof employment. The amounts reported above do\nnot include amounts that would be provided to\na NEO under plans and arrangements that are\ngenerally available to all salaried teammates\n(except in the case of Mr. Cummins for\nseverance payable under Truist\u0092s general\nseverance plan) or amounts reported in the\n\u00932021 Pension Benefits\u0094 and \u00932021 Non-\nqualifiedDeferred Compensation\u0094 tables. In\nconnection with the merger with SunTrust, Mr.\nKing\u0092s heritage BB&T employment agreement was\namended and restated and the heritage BB&T\nemployment agreements with each of Messrs.\nHenson, Starnes and Bible were amended, in\neach case, effective as of the closing of the\nmerger. In connection with the merger, Mr.\nRogers entered into an employment agreement\nthat became effective as of the closing of the\nmerger. Mr. Howard\u0092s heritage BB&T employment\nagreement was not amended in connection with\nthe merger. The discussion below is based on\nthe terms of the employment agreements with\nour NEOs as in effect on December 31, 2021.\nFor purposes of the employment agreements with\nthe heritage BB&T NEOs, the merger with\nSunTrust did not constitute a change of\ncontrol, and as such, these NEOs were not\nentitled to the enhanced or additional\nseverance rights under such agreements that\nwould otherwise be provided in connection with\na termination following a change of control.\nPursuant to the employment agreement between\nthe Company and Mr. Rogers, he waived the\nright to participate in the heritage SunTrust\nexecutive severance plan, including any rights\nor benefits arising upon the change of control\nof SunTrust. On August 16, 2021, Mr. Henson\nannounced that he would retire from his\nposition at Truist. His retirement was\neffective as of September 30, 2021. In\nconnection with his retirement, Mr. Henson was\nentitled to receive the severance benefits\npursuant to a \u0093Good Reason Termination\u0094 as set\nforth in his Amended and Restated Employment\nAgreement, effective as of November 13, 2008,\nand the First Amendment thereto, dated as of\nMay 28, 2019. Due to Mr. Henson\u0092s actual\nretirement from Truist, the below discussion\nregarding NEOs is not applicable to Mr.\nHenson. Mr. Henson received in connection with\nhis retirement 36 months of cash compensation\npayments (including salary and bonuses (other\nthan any retention or integration bonuses)\nequal to one-twelfthof the highest annual\namount of such compensation over the past\nthree years), a pro-ratedportion of his AIP\npayment for 2021, vesting of RSUs, and 36\nmonths of continued health and welfare\nbenefits, as shown in the table above. Mr.\nHenson\u0092s outstanding LTIP and PSU awards\nremain subject to the Company\u0092s actual\nperformance and will be paid on the original\nschedule for such awards after the applicable\nperformance periods have elapsed. Voluntary\nTermination or Retirement. Upon voluntary\ntermination by a NEO, any unvested awards and\nbenefits (that are not subject to acceleration\ndue to the NEO\u0092s retirement eligibility) would\nbe forfeited. Beginning with equity awards\ngranted to members of Executive Leadership in\n2020, the retirement age required for the\naward to vest upon voluntary termination or\nretirement was changed from 55 to 60 years of\nage. Messrs. King, Rogers, Starnes, and Bible\nare over 60 years of age, have more than 10\nyears of service with the Company and are\n\u0093retirement eligible.\u0094 Therefore, upon the end\nof their employment with the Company, each\nwould generally be entitled to vesting of\noutstanding unvested equity awards. Mr. Howard\nis over 55 years of age, has more than 10\nyears of service with the\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    75  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers Company for\npurposes of his outstanding equity awards due\nto prior service with a company acquired by\nTruist, and is \u0093retirement eligible\u0094 for all\noutstanding equity granted prior to October\n2021 before his promotion to Executive\nLeadership. Therefore, upon the end of his\nemployment with the Company, he would\ngenerally be entitled to vesting of\noutstanding unvested equity awards granted\nprior to October 2021. All unvested awards Mr.\nHoward was granted in October 2021 would be\nforfeited. Termination for Just Cause. If the\nCompany or Truist Bank terminates a NEO\u0092s\nemployment for \u0093Just Cause,\u0094 the NEO will not\nhave the right to receive any compensation or\nother benefits under the employment agreement\nfor any period after such termination other\nthan compensation that is earned but unpaid,\nunreimbursed expenses, and accrued and vested\nbenefits. Payments Made Upon Death or\nDisability. In the event of the death or\ndisability, and subsequent termination, of any\nNEO, the Company and Truist Bank will use\ntheir best efforts to accelerate vesting of\nany unvested benefits to which the NEO may be\nentitled under any stock-based or other\nbenefit plan or arrangement to the extent\npermitted by the terms of such plans. If Mr.\nKing or Mr. Howard were to separate service as\na result of his death, his estate would be\npaid a pro rata bonus for the year of\ntermination based on actual performance. The\nCompany generally does not terminate teammates\nas a result of disability. Termination for\nOther than Just Cause or Voluntary Termination\nfor Good Reason. For NEOs other than Mr.\nHoward, if an NEO\u0092s employment is terminated\neither (i) through voluntary termination by a\nNEO for \u0093Good Reason\u0094 or (ii) by the Company\nor Truist Bank other than for \u0093Just Cause,\u0094 he\nwill be entitled to receive monthly payments\nof cash compensation (including salary and\nbonuses (other than any retention or\nintegration bonuses)) equal to one-twelfthof\nthe highest annual amount of such compensation\nover the past three years (or if higher, the\nthree years prior to the completion of the\nmerger with SunTrust) for officers other than\nMessrs. King and Rogers, a pro rata annual\nbonus for the year of termination based on\nactual performance (for officers other than\nMessrs. King and Rogers, if the termination\noccurs prior to January 1, 2022) and teammate\nwelfare benefits, including health care and\noutplacement services, for the full three-year\nterm. For Messrs. King and Rogers, the amount\nof severance benefits due, if any, is\ndetermined by reference to Mr. King\u0092s and Mr.\nRogers\u0092, as applicable, average annual cash\ncompensation for the three years prior to the\nyear of termination rather than by reference\nto the highest such year of cash compensation.\nFor Mr. Rogers, his severance benefits due\nwill be paid in a lump sum payment within 60\ndays following his termination. In addition,\nany unvested benefits to which the NEO may be\nentitled under any stock-based awards, cash\nlong-term incentive performance awards or\nother benefit plan or arrangement will vest.\nThe receipt by any of the NEOs of payments and\nother benefits under his employment agreement\nis subject to compliance with the\nnonsolicitation provisions of the applicable\nemployment agreement and, in the case of\nMessrs. King and Rogers, a noncompetition\nprovision, as described below. For Mr. Howard,\nif his employment is terminated either (i)\nthrough voluntary termination for \u0093Good\nReason\u0094 or (ii) by the Company other than \u0093For\nCause,\u0094 he will be entitled to receive,\ncommencing no later than 30 days after his\ndate of termination and for a period of 24\nmonths from his date of termination, monthly\npayments equal to one-twenty-fourthof an\namount equal to two times the sum of (x) Mr.\nHoward\u0092s total salary immediately prior to the\ntermination plus (y) his target bonus\nopportunity for the fiscal year in which the\ndate of termination occurs, with such\nseverance payments subject to adjustment as\nmay be needed under Section 409A.\nAdditionally, Mr. Howard would continue to\nreceive certain welfare benefits as in effect\non his date of termination (or generally\ncomparable coverage) for himself and, as\napplicable, his spouse and dependents, for a\nperiod of 18 months after which the Company\nwould pay Mr. Howard a lump sum amount equal\nto 6 times the monthly COBRA rate for such\nwelfare benefits, as determined on the date of\nsuch 18-monthanniversary. As noted above, Mr.\nCummins does not have an employment agreement\nwith the Company. The amounts reflected in the\ntable above for severance upon a termination\nwithout just cause or for good reason or a\nchange of control are based on the benefits\nthat would be payable to Mr. Cummins under the\nGeneral Severance Plan for Employees of Truist\nFinancial Corporation and Affiliates due to a\nReduction in Force (as defined in the plan),\nwhich includes no longer being in a comparable\nposition with Truist within 12 months\nfollowing the date of a Change of Control.\nThis plan generally provides for severance\nbased on the teammate\u0092s total annual cash\ncompensation, including salary and incentive\ncompensation payments, in the year prior to\nthe year in which the separation from service\noccurs (\u0093Current Benefits Annual Rate\u0094). For\nan officer employee such as Mr. Cummins, the\nseverance pay benefit equals (i) (x) his\nCurrent Benefits Annual Rate divided by (y)\n52, multiplied by (ii) two times the number of\nhis years of service with Truist (not to\nexceed 30). Change of Control. The employment\nagreements with our NEOs, other than Messrs.\nKing, Rogers, and Howard, provide that, if an\nNEO\u0092s employment is terminated by the NEO or\nthe Company for any reason (other than for\n\u0093Just Cause\u0094 or on account of the death of the\nNEO) within twelve months after a \u0093Change of\nControl\u0094 of the Company (as defined in the\nagreements), the NEO will be entitled to\nreceive the termination compensation and the\nother benefits described under the column\ntitled \u0093Change of Control\u0094 in the table above.\nMessrs. King\u0092s and Howard\u0092s employment\nagreements do not contain any special\nprovisions that become applicable upon a\nChange of Control, and Mr. Rogers\u0092 employment\nagreement only provides that, upon a Change of\nControl, the term of his agreement will not\nexpire until the second anniversary of such\nevent.\n                                 \n  76    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nCompensation of Executive Officers For the\nNEOs with agreements that contain Change of\nControl provisions, the Company\u0092s Board of\nDirectors can determine, in its discretion,\nthat a transaction constitutes a \u0093Merger of\nEquals,\u0094 even though one or more of the above\ndefinitions of a \u0093Change of Control\u0094 is met,\nand, upon such determination, the applicable\nindividual will not be entitled to terminate\nhis or her employment agreement voluntarily\nand receive continued salary and benefits\nunless \u0093Good Reason\u0094 exists. The merger with\nSunTrust was determined to be a \u0093Merger of\nEquals\u0094 for purposes of these agreements. The\nemployment agreements (other than Messrs.\nRogers\u0092 and Howard\u0092s agreements) provide for\nreductions in payments to the extent necessary\nto avoid exceeding the limits established by\nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.\nPayments in excess of these limits are often\nreferred to as \u0093excess parachute payments,\u0094\nand exceeding the Section 280G limits\ngenerally triggers an excise tax on the\npayments. In the case of Mr. Rogers, a\nreduction would only be imposed if the\nreduction resulted in a greater after-\ntaxbenefit to Mr. Rogers than if such payments\nhad not been reduced. Mr. Howard\u0092s employment\nagreement does not address the impact of\nSection 280G. Employment Agreements with NEOs\n(including Restrictive Covenants). The\nfollowing discussion is as of December 31,\n2021. We had employment agreements with\nMessrs. Rogers, King, Starnes, Bible, and\nHoward to secure the services of key talent\nwithin the highly competitive financial\nservices industry, which agreements, other\nthan Messrs. Roger\u0092s and Howard\u0092s agreements,\nwere amended in connection with the merger\nwith SunTrust. Generally, the employment\nagreements are structured to carefully balance\nthe individual financial goals of the\nexecutives relative to the needs of Truist and\nits shareholders. The employment agreements\nprovide for minimum annual salaries equal to\ntheir current annual base salaries and\ncontinued participation in incentive\ncompensation plans that Truist or Truist Bank\nmay from time to time extend to its similarly\nsituated officers (in the case of Mr. Rogers,\nwith the terms and conditions of any such\nawards to be no less favorable than those\napplicable to Mr. King). During the term of\nthe employment agreements, each NEO is\nentitled to participate in and receive, on the\nsame basis as other similarly situated\nofficers of Truist and Truist Bank, pension\nand welfare benefits and other benefits such\nas sick leave, vacation, group disability and\nhealth, life and accident insurance and\nsimilar non-cashcompensation that Truist or\nTruist Bank may from time to time extend to\nits officers, which, in the case of Mr.\nRogers, will generally be those applicable to\nMr. King (and in certain instances, no less\nfavorable than those applicable to him prior\nto the merger) and will include eligibility\nfor supplemental disability benefits\nconsistent with the legacy supplemental\ndisability plan of SunTrust. The employment\nagreements for the NEOs (other than Mr.\nHoward) provide that, under certain\ncircumstances upon leaving the employment of\nTruist and Truist Bank, the executive may not\ncompete in the banking business, directly or\nindirectly, against the Company, Truist Bank\nand their affiliates. These prohibitions\ngenerally preclude the NEO from working for a\ndirect competitor with a banking presence\nwithin the continental United States.\nAdditionally, the employment agreements for\nthe NEOs prohibit the executive from\nsoliciting or assisting in the solicitation of\nany of our depositors, customers, or\naffiliates, or inducing any of our teammates\nto terminate their employment with Truist or\nits affiliates. To the extent applicable,\nthese noncompetition and nonsolicitation\nprovisions generally will be effective until\nthe one-yearanniversary of the NEO\u0092s\ntermination, other than for Mr. Howard, whose\nnoncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions\nare effective until the two-yearanniversary of\nhis termination. Other than for Mr. Howard,\nthe noncompetition provisions are not\napplicable if the NEO terminates employment\nafter a \u0093Change of Control\u0094 and are also\ninapplicable upon a termination of an NEO\n(other than Messrs. King, Rogers, and Howard)\nwithout \u0093Just Cause\u0094 or for \u0093Good Reason\u0094 and\nfollowing the expiration of the employment\nagreement. Mr. Howard\u0092s employment agreement\nprovides that, upon leaving the employment of\nthe Company for whatever reason, for a period\nof two years thereafter he may not compete in\ncompetitive wholesale insurance or retail\nbrokerage businesses, provided that insurance\nproduct manufacturers are not considered\ncompetitive businesses. While the employment\nagreements with the heritage BB&T NEOs\noriginally had terms of 36 months that\nautomatically extended monthly by an\nadditional month (except for Mr. Howard, whose\nemployment agreement has an original term of\napproximately 75 months), effective March 1,\n2019, we provided notice to each of these NEOs\n(other than Messrs. King and Howard) that the\nemployment agreement term would not be\nextended. As such, the employment agreement\nwith each heritage BB&T NEO (other than\nMessrs. King and Howard) expired on March 1,\n2022. Mr. King\u0092s amended and restated\nemployment agreement provided for his service\nas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany and Truist Bank through September 12,\n2021, and Executive Chairman through March 12,\n2022. The amended agreement provides that,\nfollowing his retirement and through September\n12, 2022, Mr. King will serve as a non-\nemployeeconsultant to Truist and Truist Bank\nand receive a monthly fee equal to one-\ntwelfth(1/12) of the sum of his base salary\nand target annual cash incentive opportunity,\nin each case as in effect immediately prior to\nhis retirement date. If Mr. King\u0092s consulting\nterm is terminated by Truist prior to its\nexpiration, he will also receive the\nconsulting fee for the full term in a lump\nsum. Mr. Rogers\u0092 employment agreement has a\nterm of three years from the date of\ncompletion of the merger (subject to extension\nin the event of a Change of Control of the\nCompany as described above). In accordance\nwith the terms of the employment agreement,\nMr. Rogers succeeded Mr. King as Chief\nExecutive Officer, and on March 12, 2022, Mr.\nRogers was named the Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors for both the Company and Truist\nBank.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    77  \n                                 \nPay Ratio Disclosure SEC rules require us to\ndisclose the ratio of the annual total\ncompensation of our CEO to the median\nemployee\u0092s (teammate\u0092s) annual total\ncompensation. In 2021, Mr. King served as\nTruist\u0092s CEO until September 12, 2021, at\nwhich time, Mr. Rogers became the CEO of\nTruist. SEC rules permit us to either\ncalculate the compensation provided to each\nperson who served as CEO during the year for\nthe time such person served as CEO and combine\nthose figures or annualize the compensation of\nthe CEO on the date selected to calculate the\nmedian employee. We have selected the first\noption. Accordingly, we have calculated the\ncompensation provided to each of Messrs. King\nand Rogers for the time he served as CEO and\nhave combined those figures. For purposes of\ncalculating the pay ratio for 2021 and\ndetermining this combined compensation amount,\nwe combined pro-ratedportions of each CEO\u0092s\ncompensation for the time they served, such as\nsalary, AIP award, LTIP, and other\ncompensation, and included actual compensation\nfor certain items, such as 401(k) matching,\nthat would be consistent for either CEO. Using\nthis method, for 2021, the combined CEO annual\ntotal compensation was $14,601,863 and the\nmedian teammate\u0092s annual total compensation\nwas $95,659. These amounts include the value\nof certain non-discriminatorybenefits. Based\nupon this information, the ratio of the annual\ntotal compensation of our CEO (on a combined\nbasis) to the median teammate was 153 to 1.\nThe CEO pay ratio rules allow us to use the\nsame median employee for comparison purposes\nfor up to three years. In determining to use\nthe same median teammate, we considered a\nsmall decrease in the total number of our U.S.\nteammates (both higher and lower compensated),\nand concluded that this change would not\nresult in a significant change to our pay\nratio disclosure. We have chosen to calculate\nthe median employee as of December 31, 2021.\nThe pay ratio identified above is a reasonable\nestimate calculated in a manner consistent\nwith SEC rules. Pay ratios that are reported\nby our peers may not be directly comparable to\nours because of differences in the composition\nof each company\u0092s workforce, the fact that we\nhad two CEOs during 2021, as well as the\nassumptions and methodologies used in\ncalculating the pay ratio, as permitted by SEC\nrules.\n                                 \n  78    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan Summary of the\nProposal On February 24, 2022, the Board, upon\nrecommendation of the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee, approved and adopted the\nTruist Financial Corporation 2022 Incentive\nPlan (the \u00932022 Plan\u0094) in the form attached\nhereto as Annex B. We are asking our\nshareholders to approve our new 2022 Plan to\nreplace our 2012 Incentive Plan, as amended\n(the \u0093Prior Plan\u0094), which expires on April 24,\n2022. If approved by our shareholders, the\n2022 Plan will become effective on April 26,\n2022, the date of our Annual Meeting of\nShareholders. No additional awards will be\ngranted under the Prior Plan after its\nexpiration on April 24, 2022. If the 2022 Plan\nis not approved by our shareholders, we may\nonly continue to issue awards under our Prior\nPlan until it expires on April 24, 2022, and\nafter that time, we will not have any\nmechanism for issuing shares of our common\nstock to achieve our incentive, recruiting and\nretention objectives. We believe our\nshareholders should approve the 2022 Plan\nbecause it is critical to our compensation\npolicy, provides for reasonable equity usage\nand shareholder dilution, and contains\nshareholder-friendly provisions. If the 2022\nPlan is not approved by our shareholders, we\nbelieve our ability to recruit and retain the\ntalent we need to compete would be seriously\nand negatively impacted, and this could affect\nour long-term success. Equity Compensation Is\na Critical Element of Our Compensation Policy\nWe believe that our future success and our\nability to remain competitive are dependent on\nour continuing efforts to recruit, retain and\nmotivate highly qualified personnel. We\noperate in a competitive market for talent. A\ncornerstone of our method for attracting and\nretaining top caliber talent has been our\nequity-based compensation program, including\nthe grant of time-based restricted stock units\n(\u0093RSUs\u0094), performance unit (\u0093PSU\u0094) awards,\nstock options and other awards under our Prior\nPlan. Providing teammates the opportunity to\nparticipate in stock ownership, and in turn,\nour long-term future performance, helps align\nthe objectives of our shareholders and our\nteammates, and is important in recruiting,\nmotivating and retaining the highly skilled\ntalent that are essential to our success. We\ngrant RSUs and PSUs subject to time- and\nperformance-based vesting to certain\nteammates, including our executives, on a\ntargeted basis to incentivize retention and\nperformance objectives. We also grant RSUs to\nour non-employeedirectors. Our Board believes\nthe 2022 Plan will enable us to continue to\nrecruit, retain and motivate talented\nindividuals who will help achieve our\nstrategic objectives, and benefit all of our\nshareholders as a result. We Consider and\nForecast Our Need for Shares Our Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee oversees our\nequity incentive awards to manage long-term\nshareholder dilution, burn rate, stock-based\ncompensation expense and stock-based\ncompensation expense as a percentage of\nrevenues while maintaining our ability to\nrecruit, reward and retain key talent in a\ncompetitive market. In evaluating the proposed\n2022 Plan, our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee, in consultation with its\ncompensation consultant and our Board,\nconsidered a number of factors, including the\ncosts of the 2022 Plan and an analysis of\ncertain burn rate, dilution and overhang\nmetrics as summarized below: Potential\nDilution. We are committed to effectively\nmanaging our teammate equity compensation\nprograms in light of potential shareholder\ndilution. For this reason, we considered both\nour \u0093burn rate\u0094 and our \u0093overhang\u0094 in\nevaluating the impact of the 2022 Plan on our\nshareholders. We define \u0093burn rate\u0094 as the\nnumber of equity awards granted during the\nyear, divided by the weighted average total\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding.\nThe number of PSUs granted shown in the table\nbelow reflects the shares that could be\neligible to vest at 100% of target for PSUs\nand includes adjustments for over or under\nachievement for PSUs granted in prior years.\nThe burn rate measures the potential dilutive\neffect of our outstanding equity grants. We\ndefine \u0093overhang\u0094 as the stock options\noutstanding but not exercised and outstanding\nfull value awards (which include RSUs and\nPSUs), plus shares available to be granted as\nequity awards, divided by the total number of\nshares of common stock outstanding. The\noverhang measures the potential dilutive\neffect of outstanding equity awards plus\nshares available for grant under our equity\ncompensation plans. The burn rate and overhang\nfigures included below are based on equity\nawards granted and available for grant under\nour Prior Plan, and exclude potential dilution\nresulting from shares issued pursuant to our\nproposed 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n(See Proposal 5). During the past three fiscal\nyears, we granted equity awards under our\nPrior Plan as summarized in the chart below.\nOur three-year average burn rate was\napproximately 0.54% for fiscal years 2019\nthrough 2021 (see chart below for a\ncalculation of our three-year burn rate).\nTruist anticipates that this annual burn rate\nin the near term will be generally consistent\nwith recent years.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    79  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan Three-Year\nAverage Burn Rate Calculation\n                                              \n        FY\u2026       FY\u2026       FY\u2026       Av\u2026     \n  O\u2026                                          \n  g\u2026                                          \n  u\u2026      0         0         0         0     \n  P\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                                          \n  g\u2026    3,\u2026       7,\u2026       7,\u2026       6,\u2026     \n  u\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    3,\u2026       7,\u2026       7,\u2026       6,\u2026     \n  g\u2026                                          \n  W\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  of    80\u2026       1,\u2026       1,\u2026       1,\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026    0.\u2026  %    0.\u2026  %    0.\u2026  %    0.\u2026  %  \n  R\u2026                                          \n                                              \nEquity Awards Outstanding As of February 22,\n2022, there were 1,329,046,090 total shares of\nour common stock outstanding, 6,533,144 shares\navailable for grant under our Prior Plan, and\nequity awards outstanding under the Prior Plan\nas summarized in the table below.

This summary,\nhowever, does not purport to be a complete\ndescription of all of the provisions of the\n2022 Plan. It is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text and actual terms of\nthe 2022 Plan, a copy of which is attached\nhereto as Annex B. BACKGROUND; PURPOSE Subject\nto our shareholder\u0092s approval, the 2022 Plan\nwill become effective on the April 26, 2022\ndate of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders\n(\u0093Effective Date\u0094), and will terminate on the\n10 year anniversary of the Effective Date\nunless it is terminated earlier by the Board.\nThe 2022 Plan provides for the grant of stock\noptions, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock awards, restricted stock units,\nperformance share awards, performance unit\nawards, long-term incentive performance\nawards, phantom stock awards and annual\nincentive performance awards. The purpose of\nthe 2022 Plan is to provide incentives to\nrecruit, retain and motivate eligible persons\nwhose present and potential contributions are\nimportant to our success. ELIGIBILITY\nTeammates, non-employeedirectors and\nindependent contractors of Truist or its\naffiliates are eligible to receive awards. As\nof February 22, 2022, we had approximately\n51,472 full-time and part-time teammates,\nincluding executive officers, and 19 non-\nemployeedirectors who would be eligible to\nparticipate in the 2022 Plan. The Company has\na small number of independent contractors who\nwould be eligible for participation in the\n2022 Plan, but the Company generally has not\ngranted awards to independent contractors\nunder the Prior Plan and does not currently\ncontemplate doing so under the 2022 Plan.\nADMINISTRATION The 2022 Plan is administered\nby the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee, all of the members of which are\nnon-employeedirectors under applicable federal\nsecurities laws (the \u0093Administrator\u0094). The\nAdministrator has the authority to construe\nand interpret the plan, determine who will\nreceive awards, grant awards, determine the\nterms and conditions of awards and make all\nother determinations necessary or advisable\nfor the administration of the plan (subject to\nthe limitations set forth in the 2022 Plan).\nHowever, our Board establishes the terms for\nthe grant of awards to non-employeedirectors\nas discussed below under \u0093 Awards to Non-\nEmployeeDirectors.\u0094\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    81  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan SHARE RESERVE\nThe 2022 Plan initially reserves 36,500,000\nshares of our common stock (plus the\nPreviously Authorized Shares, as defined\nbelow, and the Forfeited Shares, as defined\nbelow) for issuance in connection with stock\noptions, restricted stock units, performance\nshare units and other equity-based awards\ngranted under the 2022 Plan. \u0093Previously\nAuthorized Shares\u0094 means shares of common\nstock previously authorized for awards under\nthe Prior Plan and not subject to outstanding\nawards under the Prior Plan as of the\nEffective Date, which includes the share\nreserve transferred from the SunTrust Banks,\nInc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan\nto the Prior Plan, which will no longer be\nlimited to awards to former teammates or\nservice providers of SunTrust Banks, Inc. and\nits affiliates upon the approval of the 2022\nPlan by Truist\u0092s shareholders. \u0093Forfeited\nShares\u0094 means shares of common stock currently\nsubject to outstanding awards under the Prior\nPlan as of the Effective Date that expire, or\nare cancelled, forfeited or otherwise\nterminated without the issuance of shares of\ncommon stock, or are settled in cash rather\nthan the issuance of shares of common stock,\nafter the Effective Date. These Forfeited\nShares under the Prior Plan and 2022 Plan\nawards that are forfeited, expired, lapsed or\notherwise terminated, or settled in cash,\nwithout such shares being issued, will again\nbecome available for issuance under the 2022\nPlan. Shares tendered or withheld to pay\neither the exercise price of an award or the\nwithholding taxes due upon the exercise or\nsettlement of an award will reduce the number\nof shares available for issuance under the\n2022 Plan and will not be returned to the\nshares authorized for grant under the 2022\nPlan. EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENTS In the event of a\nchange in our common stock as a result of a\nstock dividend, merger, reorganization,\nrecapitalization, stock split, reverse stock\nsplit, consolidation, reclassification, spin-\noff,or similar change in the capital structure\nof Truist, proportionate adjustments will be\nmade to the number and class of shares\nreserved for issuance and future grant under\nthe 2022 Plan and the applicable exercise\nprices of and number and class of shares\nsubject to outstanding awards, subject to any\nrequired action by the Board or the\nshareholders of Truist. AWARDS The 2022 Plan\nwill permit us to grant the following types of\nawards: Stock Options. The 2022 Plan provides\nfor the grant of incentive stock options\nwithin the meaning of Section 422 of the\nInternal Revenue Code (\u0093Incentive Options\u0094)\nand nonqualified stock options that do not\nqualify as Incentive Options (\u0093Nonqualified\nOptions\u0094). Incentive Options may be granted\nonly to our teammates or teammates of our\naffiliates. Nonqualified Options may be\ngranted to our teammates, non-\nemployeedirectors and independent contractors.\nWe are able to issue no more than 36,500,000\nshares pursuant to the grant of Incentive\nOptions under the 2022 Plan. The Administrator\ndetermines the terms of each option award,\nprovided that Incentive Options are subject to\nstatutory limitations. The Administrator also\ndetermines the exercise price for a stock\noption, provided that the exercise price of an\noption may not be less than the fair market\nvalue of our common stock on the date of grant\n(with certain additional requirements for\ncertain Incentive Options). Options granted\nunder the 2022 Plan vest at the rate and/or\nsubject to requirements specified by the\nAdministrator and such vesting schedule is set\nforth in the stock option agreement to which\nsuch stock option grant relates. The\nAdministrator determines the term of stock\noptions granted under the 2022 Plan, up to a\nterm of ten years (with additional\nrequirements, such as a five year term, for\ncertain Incentive Options). After the option\nholder ceases to provide services to us, he or\nshe is able to exercise his or her vested\noption for the period of time stated in the\nstock option award agreement to which such\noption relates. An option may not be exercised\nlater than its expiration date. Options may\nnot be repriced without shareholder approval,\nand may not include reload provisions. Stock\nAppreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights\nprovide for a payment, or payments, in cash,\nshares of common stock or a combination of\ncash and shares of common stock to the holder\nbased upon the difference between the fair\nmarket value of our common stock on the date\nof exercise and the stated grant price of the\nstock appreciation right. Stock appreciation\nrights may be related or unrelated to a stock\noption award. Stock appreciation rights may\nvest based on time or achievement of\nperformance goals. Stock appreciation rights\nmay not be repriced without shareholder\napproval, and may not include reload\nprovisions. Phantom Stock Awards. A phantom\nstock award is an award of a number of\nhypothetical share units with respect to\nshares of common stock, with a value based on\nthe fair market value of a share of common\nstock. Upon vesting, a phantom stock award may\nbe paid in cash, shares of common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of common\nstock. Restricted Stock Awards. A restricted\nstock award is an award of shares of common\nstock subject to restrictions that the\nAdministrator may impose. These restrictions\nmay be based on completion of a specified\nperiod of service with us or upon the\nachievement of performance goals during a\nperformance period. The Administrator\ndetermines the price, if any, of a restricted\nstock award. Unless otherwise set forth in the\naward agreement, vesting will cease on the\ndate the participant no longer provides\nservices to us, and at that time unvested\nshares will be forfeited.\n                                 \n  82    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan Restricted\nStock Units. An award of restricted stock\nunits represents the right to receive cash,\nshares of common stock or a combination of\ncash and shares of common stock at a specified\ndate in the future, subject to vesting\nrequirements and forfeiture of such right due\nto termination of employment or failure to\nachieve performance goals as specified in an\naward agreement. Performance Awards. A\nperformance award is an award denominated in\nperformance shares or performance units that\nis subject to achievement of performance goals\nspecified in an award agreement. Performance\nawards may be settled in cash, shares of\ncommon stock or a combination of cash and\nshares of common stock. Performance awards are\nsubject to forfeiture if performance goals are\nnot achieved for a performance period. Annual\nIncentive Performance Awards. Annual incentive\nperformance awards may be granted to teammates\nbased upon achievement of annual performance\ngoals. Such awards will be payable in the\nfirst quarter of the following calendar year\nin either cash, restricted stock units or a\ncombination of cash and restricted stock units\ndetermined on the basis of achievement of\nspecified performance goals. PERFORMANCE\nMEASURES The Administrator may establish\nperformance goals based on performance\nmeasures set forth in the 2022 Plan, except\nwith respect to annual incentive performance\nawards which may be based on such individual\nand/or business performance goals as the\nAdministrator may determine. The performance\ncriteria for awards other than annual\nincentive performance awards include, but are\nnot limited to, return measures; earnings\nmeasures; expense measures; balance sheet\nmeasures; enterprise risk management measures;\ninternal or external regulatory capital,\nliquidity, risk, or other regulatory-related\nrequirements, expectations, goals or\nobjectives; market or market-related measures;\nstrategic business goals and objectives; off-\nbalancesheet portfolio objectives; product,\nconsumer or market-related objectives; cash\nflow; and other objective measures established\nby the Administrator. The Administrator may\nprovide for one or more adjustments to the\nperformance criteria. MINIMUM VESTING A\nmaximum of 5% of the aggregate number of\nshares of our common stock available for\nissuance under the 2022 Plan may be issued\nwithout a vesting period of at least one year\nfollowing the date of grant. All other awards\nwill have a minimum vesting period of at least\none year, subject to limited exceptions in the\ncase of awards to non-employeedirectors that\nvest as early as 50 weeks from date of grant\nwhere vesting is tied to the next annual\nshareholders meeting, and for awards that\naccelerate vesting upon death or disability.\nSHAREHOLDER APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR REPRICING,\nEXCHANGE AND BUYOUT The Administrator may not,\nwithout the approval of our shareholders,\nlower the exercise price per share of any\naward after it is granted, or cancel any award\nwhen the exercise price per share exceeds the\nfair market value of one share in exchange for\nanother award or cash. CLAWBACK Each\nparticipant in the 2022 Plan who receives an\naward will comply with any clawback policy\nadopted by Truist from time to time. All\nawards will be subject to clawback, forfeiture\nor recoupment pursuant to such policy adopted\nby the Board or required by law, and in\naddition to any other remedies available under\nsuch policy and applicable law. RESTRICTIONS\nON DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS Except\nfor awards of restricted stock where dividends\nmay be paid prior to the lapse of a\nrestriction thereon, a participant will have\nno right to payment of dividends or dividend\nequivalents with respect to unvested awards,\nand any such dividends or dividend equivalents\nwill be accrued and paid only at such time, if\nany, as such unvested awards become vested and\nare no longer subject to restrictions and risk\nof forfeiture. No dividends or dividend\nequivalents may be granted or paid with\nrespect to stock options and stock\nappreciation rights. CHANGE OF CONTROL If we\nundergo a Change of Control (as defined in the\n2022 Plan), the 2022 Plan provides that\noutstanding awards may be assumed, converted\nor substituted by the successor or surviving\nentity, provided that if within two years\nafter the Change of Control a participant\u0092s\nemployment is terminated without cause, then\nthe participant\u0092s outstanding exercisable\nawards will become fully exercisable, all\ntime-based vesting awards will vest, and\noutstanding performance awards will be earned\nbased on actual performance through the end of\nthe performance period and thereafter paid on\na pro rata basis. In the event such successor\nor surviving entity does not assume, convert\nor substitute awards pursuant to a Change of\nControl, then such awards will have their\nvesting accelerate, with the acceleration of\npayment of performance awards within thirty\ndays following the date of the Change of\nControl based on the target level of\nperformance, with pro rata payouts to\nparticipants based upon the expired portion of\nthe performance period. TRANSFERABILITY OF\nAWARDS The 2022 Plan does not allow for the\ntransfer of awards, other than by will or the\nlaws of descent and distribution, or\nbeneficiary designation effective upon death.\nOnly the recipient of an award may exercise it\nduring his or her lifetime.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    83  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan AWARDS TO NON-\nEMPLOYEEDIRECTORS Non-employeedirectors are\neligible to receive any type of award offered\nunder the 2022 Plan except Incentive Options\nand annual incentive performance awards. No\nnon-employeedirector may receive awards under\nthe 2022 Plan that exceed $750,000 in value in\nany calendar fiscal year. Awards under the\n2022 Plan may be granted to non-\nemployeedirectors as determined by the Board\nsubject to such annual limitation. AMENDMENT\nAND TERMINATION The Board is permitted to\namend or terminate the 2022 Plan, or any award\ngranted thereunder, at any time, subject to\nshareholder approval of any amendment where\nrequired by applicable law, rule or\nregulation, or where the option price or base\nprice of a stock appreciation right is\nproposed to be repriced, or where the option\nor stock appreciation right will be exchanged\nfor another award or cash. In addition, no\namendment that is detrimental to a participant\nin the 2022 Plan may be made to an outstanding\naward without the consent of the affected\nparticipant unless such termination or\namendment is necessary to comply with\napplicable law, regulation or rule. Provided\nthe 2022 Plan is approved by our shareholders\nat the April 26, 2022 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders, and unless terminated earlier in\naccordance with its terms, the 2022 Plan will\nterminate on April 26, 2032, ten years from\nthe date it was approved by our shareholders.\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\nThe following is a general summary of the\nfederal income tax treatment of awards which\nare authorized for grant under the 2022 Plan,\nbased upon the provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code in effect as of the date hereof.\nThis summary is not intended to be exhaustive,\ndoes not discuss the tax consequences upon a\nparticipant\u0092s death or any federal surtaxes,\nand the exact tax consequences to any award\nholder depend upon his or her particular\ncircumstances and other facts. Participants in\nthe 2022 Plan should consult their tax\nadvisors with respect to any state, local and\nnon-U.S.tax considerations or relevant federal\ntax implications of awards granted under the\n2022 Plan. Incentive Options. An option holder\nrecognizes no taxable income for regular\nincome tax purposes as a result of the grant\nor exercise of an Incentive Option that\nqualifies under Section 422 of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Option holders who neither\ndispose of their shares of our common stock\nwithin two years of the date that the stock\noption was granted or within one year\nfollowing the exercise of the stock option,\nnormally recognize a capital gain or loss on\nthe sale of the shares equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the sale price and\nthe purchase price of the shares. If an option\nholder satisfies these holding periods, on the\nsale of the shares of our common stock, we are\nnot entitled to any deduction for federal\nincome tax purposes. Where an option holder\ndisposes of shares of our common stock within\ntwo years after the date of grant of those\nstock options or within one year after the\ndate of exercise, which we refer to as a\ndisqualifying disposition, the difference\nbetween the fair market value of the shares of\nour common stock on the exercise date and the\nstock option exercise price (which is not to\nexceed the gain realized on the sale, if the\ndisposition is a transaction with respect to\nwhich a loss, if sustained, would be\nrecognized) is taxed as ordinary income at the\ntime of disposition. Any gain in excess of\nthat amount is a capital gain. If a loss is\nrecognized, there is no ordinary income, and\nsuch loss is a capital loss. Any ordinary\nincome recognized by the option holder on the\ndisqualifying disposition of the shares of our\ncommon stock generally results in a deduction\nby us for federal income tax purposes. The\ndifference between the stock option exercise\nprice and the fair market value of the shares\non the exercise date is treated as an\nadjustment in computing the option holder\u0092s\nalternative minimum taxable income and may be\nsubject to an alternative minimum tax which is\npaid if such tax exceeds the regular tax for\nthe year. Special rules may apply with respect\nto certain subsequent sales of the shares in a\ndisqualifying disposition, certain basis\nadjustments for purposes of computing the\nalternative minimum taxable income on a\nsubsequent sale of the shares and certain tax\ncredits which may arise with respect to option\nholders subject to the alternative minimum\ntax. Nonqualified Options. Stock options not\ndesignated or not qualifying as Incentive\nOptions are nonqualified stock options having\nno special tax status. An option holder\ngenerally recognizes no taxable income as a\nresult of the grant of the stock option. On\nthe exercise of a nonqualified stock option,\nthe option holder normally recognizes ordinary\nincome in the amount of the difference between\nthe stock option exercise price and the fair\nmarket value of the shares of our common stock\non the exercise date. Where the option holder\nis a teammate, such ordinary income generally\nis subject to withholding of income and\nemployment taxes. On the sale of shares of our\ncommon stock acquired by the exercise of a\nnonqualified stock option, any gain or loss\n(based on the difference between the sale\nprice and the fair market value on the\nexercise date), is taxed as a capital gain or\nloss. No tax deduction is available to us with\nrespect to the grant of a nonqualified stock\noption or the sale of the stock acquired\npursuant to such grant. We should generally be\nentitled to a deduction equal to the amount of\nordinary income recognized by the option\nholder as a result of the exercise of a\nnonqualified stock option. Stock Appreciation\nRights.In general, no taxable income is\nreportable when a stock appreciation right is\ngranted to a participant. Upon exercise, the\nparticipant generally will recognize ordinary\nincome in an amount equal to the cash and fair\nmarket value of any shares of our common stock\nreceived. If the participant is a teammate,\nsuch ordinary income generally is subject to\nwithholding of income and employment taxes.\nAny additional gain or loss recognized upon\nany later disposition of the shares would be\ncapital gain or loss.\n                                 \n  84    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan Restricted\nStock Awards and Performance Share Awards.A\nparticipant acquiring restricted shares\n(either restricted stock awards or performance\nshare awards) generally will recognize\nordinary income equal to the fair market value\nof the shares on the vesting date. If the\nparticipant is a teammate, such ordinary\nincome generally is subject to withholding of\nincome and employment taxes. The participant\nmay elect, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code, to accelerate the\nordinary income tax event on restricted stock\nor performance shares to the date of\nacquisition by filing an election with the\nInternal Revenue Service no later than thirty\n(30) days after the date the restricted shares\nor performance shares are acquired. Upon the\nsale of shares acquired pursuant to a\nrestricted stock award or performance share\naward, any gain or loss, based on the\ndifference between the sale price and the fair\nmarket value on the date the ordinary income\ntax event occurs, will be taxed as capital\ngain or loss. Restricted Stock Unit and\nPerformance Unit Awards. There generally are\nno immediate tax consequences of receiving an\naward of restricted stock units or performance\nunits. A participant who is awarded restricted\nstock units or performance units generally\nwill be required to recognize ordinary income\nin an amount equal to the cash and fair market\nvalue of shares issued to such participant at\nthe end of the applicable vesting period or,\nif later, the settlement date. If the\nparticipant is a teammate, such ordinary\nincome generally is subject to withholding of\nincome and employment taxes. Any additional\ngain or loss recognized upon any later\ndisposition of any shares received would be\ncapital gain or loss. Annual Incentive\nPerformance Awards. The tax consequences\nrelating to annual incentive performance\nawards will depend upon the provisions of such\nawards, with the tax consequences relating to\nrestricted stock units described above to the\nextent such awards result in an award of\nrestricted stock units. Deductibility of\nCompensation. The Internal Revenue Code limits\npublicly held corporations\u0092 compensation\ndeductions per \u0093covered employee\u0094 (i.e., the\nprincipal executive officer, principal\nfinancial officer, the next three most highly-\ncompensated officers, and any individual who\nwas a covered employee since January 1, 2017)\nto $1 million per year. Despite this, we\nreserve the right to grant awards under the\n2022 Omnibus Plan even though such awards may\nnot entitle us to a tax deduction. ERISA\nInformation. The 2022 Plan is not subject to\nthe provisions of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974, as amended.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    85  \n                                 \nProposal 4\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan New Plan\nBenefits No awards have been made under the\n2022 Plan, and no awards have been granted\nthat are contingent on shareholder approval of\nthe 2022 Plan. Awards under the 2022 Plan\nwould be made at the discretion of the\nAdministrator or, with respect to non-\nemployeedirectors, the Board of Directors.\nTherefore, the awards or number of shares of\ncommon stock subject to awards that may be\ngranted in the future to teammates, including\nexecutive officers, and non-employeedirectors\nunder the 2022 Plan are not determinable at\nthis time. The table below, however, sets\nforth the value of benefits that would have\nbeen received or allocated to each of the\nfollowing persons or groups, in each case,\nunder the 2022 Plan with respect to the 2021\nfiscal year if the 2022 Plan had been in\neffect and the Prior Plan had not been in\neffect, in each case, based on awards made\nunder the Prior Plan. These awards are not\nnecessarily indicative of awards we may grant\nin the future.

The Board recommends\nthat Truist shareholders approve the ESPP. The\nBoard believes that adoption of the ESPP will\nadvance and promote the interests of the\nshareholders of Truist by offering to eligible\nteammates of Truist and its designated\nsubsidiaries (together, the \u0093Participating\nSubsidiaries\u0094) the opportunity to acquire an\nownership interest, or to increase their\nownership interest, in Truist. The ESPP will\nprovide a means for a broad base of teammates\nto voluntarily acquire Truist common stock,\n$5.00 par value per share (\u0093common stock\u0094) and\nthereby further align their interests with\nthose of Truist\u0092s shareholders. The ESPP is\nintended to qualify as an \u0093employee stock\npurchase plan\u0094 under Section 423 of the\nInternal Revenue Code (the \u0093Code\u0094), which\npermits eligible teammates to purchase common\nstock on a tax-preferredbasis (see below\nsection \u0093Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nESPP Participation\u0094). The ESPP also creates\nincentives for eligible teammates to purchase\nshares of common stock because teammates\npurchase the shares at a set discount from the\ntrading price of the shares on the purchase\ndate (see below section \u0093Purchase Price\u0094) and\npay for the purchases through payroll\ndeductions (see below section \u0093Payment of\nPurchase Price; Payroll Deductions\u0094). By\napproving the ESPP, Truist\u0092s shareholders set\naside a fixed reserve of common stock that\nwill be available to eligible teammates of\nTruist and Participating Subsidiaries to\npurchase based on the terms and conditions of\nthe ESPP. If this Proposal 5 is approved by\nshareholders, the ESPP will become effective\non April 26, 2022, the date of the Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders. In the event that\nshareholders do not approve this Proposal 5,\nthe ESPP will not become effective. Material\nFeatures of the ESPP The following summary of\nthe material features of the ESPP is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to the complete\ntext of the ESPP in Annex Cof this Proxy\nStatement. ADMINISTRATION The administrator of\nthe ESPP (the \u0093Plan Administrator\u0094) has full\nauthority to administer, interpret, and modify\nthe terms of the ESPP and to make rules as\nnecessary for administration of the ESPP. The\nPlan Administrator is the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee of the Board, although\nthe Board may appoint another committee to\nadminister the ESPP. STOCK SUBJECT TO THE ESPP\nA total of 65 million shares of common stock\nis reserved for purchase and issuance under\nthe ESPP. This share reserve is subject to\nadjustment in the event of a stock split,\nstock dividend or other similar change in the\ncommon stock or the capital structure of\nTruist. There is no evergreen provision,\nmeaning the ESPP share limit will not increase\nwithout shareholder approval. The 65 million\nshares of common stock reserved for purchase\nand issuance under the ESPP is less than 5% of\nTruist\u0092s 1,328,993,308 issued and outstanding\nshares of common stock as of February 17,\n2022, the record date for the Annual Meeting\nof Shareholders. TERM OF THE ESPP If approved\nby Truist shareholders, the ESPP will continue\nuntil the earlier of (i) the date all reserved\nshares have been issued, (ii) the date the\nESPP is terminated by the Board, or (iii) the\nten (10) year anniversary of its April 26,\n2022 effective date. ELIGIBILITY Teammates who\nare officers subject to Section 16 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nnon-employeedirectors, and holders of five\npercent (5%) or more of the total combined\nvoting power or value of all classes of stock\nof Truist or any of its subsidiaries are not\neligible to participate in the ESPP. In\naddition, the following teammates are excluded\nfrom participating in the ESPP: (i) teammates\nwho have been employed less than 12 months,\nand (ii) teammates who are scheduled to work\nless than 20 hours per week. Truist or the\nPlan Administrator will designate which\nsubsidiaries of Truist will participate in the\nESPP as Participating Subsidiaries. Truist and\nthe following subsidiaries are expected to\nparticipate in the ESPP for the offering\nperiods scheduled to commence on and after\nJuly 1, 2022: AFCO Acceptance Corp.; AFCO\nCredit Corp.; AmRisc, LLC; BB&T Collateral\nService Corporation; BB&T Merchant Services,\nLLC; CB Finance, Inc.; CRC Insurance Services,\nInc.; Crump Life Insurance Services, Inc.; GFO\nAdvisory Services, LLC; Grandbridge Real\nEstate Capital, LLC; J.H. Blades Co., Inc.;\nMcGriff Insurance Services, Inc.; Norma-\nSpencer Agency, LLC; Peak Health Services,\nLLC; Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation,\nInc.; Regional Acceptance Corporation; Service\nFinance Company, LLC; Sterling Capital\nManagement, LLC; STI Institutional &\nGovernment, Inc.; SunTrust Equity Funding, LLC\n; Truist Advisory Services, Inc.; Truist Bank;\nTruist CIG, LLC; Truist Community Capital,\nLLC; Truist Delaware Trust Company; Truist\nEquipment Finance Corp; Truist Insurance\nHoldings, Inc.; Truist Investment Services,\nInc.; Truist Leasing Corporation; Truist\nSecurities, Inc.; and Wellington Insurance\nServices, Inc. As of February 10, 2022,\napproximately 47,549 teammates of Truist and\nthose subsidiaries would have been eligible to\nparticipate in the ESPP if it had been in\neffect on such date.\n                                 \n  88    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 5\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nAs a Code Section 423 employee stock purchase\nplan, all eligible teammates must have equal\nrights and privileges under the ESPP, and the\nterms of the ESPP must be administered\nuniformly for all eligible teammates. OFFERING\nPERIOD The Plan Administrator has discretion\nto determine the start and duration of\noffering periods under the ESPP, but in\nconformance with the rules under Code Section\n423 an offering period may not exceed twenty-\nseven (27) months. Unless the Plan\nAdministrator determines otherwise, shares of\ncommon stock will be offered for purchase\nunder the ESPP through a series of consecutive\nbiannual offerings beginning on each January 1\nand July 1, and ending on the immediately\nfollowing June 30 and December 31,\nrespectively, with the first offering period\ncommencing on July 1, 2022. On the first day\nof each offering period, a participating\nteammate is granted a purchase right, which is\nautomatically exercised on the last trading\nday of the offering period (the \u0093Purchase\nDate\u0094). During an offering period, pre-\nauthorizedpayroll deductions are made from the\nparticipants\u0092 compensation and credited to\nthem under the ESPP. The ESPP is unfunded and\nall participant crediting under the ESPP\nconsists of bookkeeping only credits. When a\npurchase right is automatically exercised, the\namount of the participant\u0092s payroll deductions\nfor the offering period is automatically used\nto purchase shares of common stock on the\nPurchase Date. PURCHASE PRICE For the initial\noffering period scheduled to commence July 1,\n2022, the price per share to purchase shares\nof common stock under the ESPP will be 85% of\nthe fair market value of Truist common stock\non the Purchase Date (December 30, 2022, the\nlast trading day of the offering period), but\nno less than the $5.00 par value per share of\ncommon stock. Fair market value means the\nclosing price of a share of common stock, as\nquoted on the New York Stock Exchange, on a\ntrading date. As of February 23, 2022, the\nfair market value of a share of common stock\nwas $60.60, the closing price on such date;\nand if that date had been a Purchase Date, the\npurchase price per share of common stock would\nhave been 85% of $60.60 or $51.51. The ESPP\nwill create a compensation expense for\naccounting purposes because the purchase price\nof the shares of common stock will be 85% of\nfair market value on a Purchase Date. PAYMENT\nOF PURCHASE PRICE; PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS On each\nPurchase Date, shares of common stock will be\npurchased with participants\u0092 payroll\ndeductions that have accumulated during the\napplicable offering period. Participating\nteammates may elect payroll deductions,\nranging from 1% to such maximum percentage\nspecified by the Plan Administrator for an\noffering period, of the participating\nteammate\u0092s cash base pay (including overtime),\ncommissions and bonus amounts with respect to\nan offering period that are reportable in box\n1 of a teammate\u0092s IRS Form W-2Wage and Tax\nStatement. ANNUAL SHARE PURCHASE LIMIT The\nfair market value of shares of common stock\nthat a participating teammate may purchase\nthrough the ESPP during any calendar year may\nnot exceed $25,000. This is the statutory\nlimit under Code Section 423. CHANGE OF\nPAYROLL DEDUCTION A participating teammate may\nonly decrease or increase the percentage of\ntheir payroll deductions during an offering\nperiod inaccordance with the procedures\nestablished and communicated by the Plan\nAdministrator in advance of an offering\nperiod. WITHDRAWAL; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT\nA participating teammate may, at least 15 days\n(or such other time period established by the\nPlan Administrator and communicated prior to\nthe beginning of an offering period) prior to\na Purchase Date, voluntarily withdraw from an\noffering period under the ESPP once the\noffering period has commenced. A participating\nteammate will automatically be withdrawn from\nan offering period upon a termination of\nemployment with Truist and all Participating\nSubsidiaries prior to a Purchase Date, and a\nterminated teammate\u0092s unused payroll\ndeductions will be refunded. ASSIGNABILITY AND\nTRANSFERABILITY No purchase rights under the\nESPP are assignable or transferable by a\nparticipating teammate, except by will or the\nlaws of inheritance following a participant\u0092s\ndeath. An attempt by a participating teammate\nto assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise\ndispose of his or her purchase rights will be\ninvalid. During a participant\u0092s lifetime, a\npurchase right granted under the ESPP may be\nexercisable only by the participant.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    89  \n                                 \nProposal 5\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nAMENDMENT, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION The\nBoard may at any time amend or terminate the\nESPP. No amendment to the ESPP will be\neffective without the approval or ratification\nof Truist\u0092s shareholders if such amendment\nwould require shareholder approval under Code\nSection 423 (for example, an increase in the\nshare reserve) or any other applicable law or\nregulation. Upon termination of the ESPP, the\nPlan Administrator may elect to terminate the\ncurrent offering period or permit any current\noffering period to expire in accordance with\nthe terms of the ESPP after the Purchase Date\nfor such offering period. If any offering\nperiod is terminated prior to its expiration\nand Purchase Date, unused payroll deductions,\nif any, of each participating teammate will be\nrefunded (without interest) to the\nparticipating teammate as soon as practicable\nthereafter. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nESPP Participation The following is a general\nsummary under current law of the material\nfederal income tax consequences to\nparticipants in the ESPP. This summary deals\nwith the general tax principles that apply and\nis provided only for general information. Some\nkinds of taxes, such as state, local and\nfederal employment taxes, are not discussed.\nTax laws are complex and subject to change and\nmay vary depending on individual circumstances\nand from locality to locality. The summary\ndoes not discuss all aspects of income\ntaxation that may be relevant to a participant\nin light of his or her personal investment\ncircumstances. This summarized tax information\nis not tax advice. Section 423 of the Code\nwill provide certain tax benefits to\nparticipating teammates purchasing shares of\ncommon stock under the ESPP. A participating\nteammate will not recognize income for federal\nincome tax purposes upon the grant of a\npurchase right for any offering period. Also,\nthe participating teammate will not recognize\nincome upon the automatic exercise of the\npurchase right to purchase shares of common\nstock. The participating teammate will\nrecognize income only when he or she sells the\nshares of common stock. The participating\nteammate\u0092s taxable income upon the sale of the\nshares of common stock will be based on the\nexcess (if any) of the sale price over the\npurchase price. The character of the income\n(ordinary income, short-term capital gains or\nlong-term capital gains) depends on whether\nthe teammate sells the shares of common stock\nin a qualifying disposition or a disqualifying\ndisposition. The sale will be treated as a\nqualifying disposition if the teammate has\nsatisfied the holding requirement under Code\nSection 423. If the teammate holds the shares\nuntil at least the later of (i) two years from\nthe first day of the applicable offering\nperiod or (ii) one year from the Purchase\nDate, then the sale will be treated as a\nqualifying disposition. Upon sale in a\nqualifying disposition, the teammate\u0092s\nordinary income will be limited to the lesser\nof (i) the discount to the purchase price of\nthe shares on the Purchase Date, or (ii) the\nnet gain (i.e., the fair market value on the\ndate the share of common stock is sold less\nthe purchase price), if any, from selling the\nshares of common stock. Any remaining income\nrecognized upon the sale of the shares will be\ntreated as long-term capital gain. In general,\na qualifying disposition has been a tax\npreferred sale because the maximum federal\nincome tax rate on long-term capital gains has\ngenerally been lower than for ordinary income\n(or short-term capital gains). If the fair\nmarket value of the shares of common stock on\nthe date of the qualifying disposition is less\nthan the purchase price for the shares, there\nwill be no ordinary income, and any loss\nrecognized will generally be a capital loss.\nIf the teammate does not meet the holding\nrequirement described above, then the sale is\na disqualifying disposition, and the teammate\nwill realize ordinary income in an amount\nequal to the difference between the fair\nmarket value of the shares on the Purchase\nDate on which the teammate acquired the shares\nand the purchase price paid for the shares of\ncommon stock. In addition, if the teammate\nsells the shares at a price in excess of the\nfair market value of the shares on the\nPurchase Date, the teammate will realize\ncapital gain in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the selling price of the\nshares and the fair market value of the shares\non the Purchase Date. Alternatively, if the\nteammate sells the shares at a price less than\nthe fair market value of the shares of common\nstock on the Purchase Date, the teammate will\nrealize a capital loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the fair market value\nof the shares on the Purchase Date and the\nselling price of the shares. Truist (or, as\napplicable, the Participating Subsidiary that\nemploys the teammate) will not be entitled to\na deduction based on the 15% purchase price\ndiscount on the shares of common stock\npurchased by a participating teammate if he or\nshe satisfies the applicable holding period\nunder Code Section 423. However, if a teammate\nsells the shares of common stock prior to the\nend of the Code Section 423 holding period,\nTruist or the Participating Subsidiary, as\napplicable, will be entitled to a deduction in\nan amount equal to the ordinary income\nrecognized by the teammate (i.e., the excess\nof the fair market value of the shares of\ncommon stock on the Purchase Date over the\npurchase price). Registration with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission If the ESPP\nis approved by Truist shareholders, Truist\nwill file a registration statement with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission pursuant to\nthe Securities Act of 1933 covering the shares\nof common stock authorized for issuance under\nthe ESPP.\n                                 \n  90    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 5\u0097Approval of the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nNew Plan Benefits The ESPP is a new plan.\nParticipation in the ESPP by eligible\nteammates is voluntary. The number of shares\nof common stock that may be purchased in any\none offering period under the ESPP is\ndependent on how many teammates are eligible,\nhow many actually elect to participate in the\nESPP, each participant\u0092s election as to the\nlevel of payroll deduction, and the purchase\nprice for each applicable offering period.\nAccordingly, the number of teammates who will\nparticipate in the ESPP, the number of shares\nexpected to be purchased under the ESPP in any\none offering period (in general, or as to any\nparticular individual or group of teammates),\nand the potential duration of the ESPP, are\nnot determinable. Equity Compensation Plan\nInformation As context for this Proposal 5,\nplease note that Truist shareholders\npreviously approved other equity compensation\nplans for Truist, and Proposal 4 requests that\nshareholders approve a new 2022 Incentive\nPlan. The table included with Proposal 4 under\nthe heading \u0093Equity Compensation Plan\nInformation\u0094, which is consistent with the\ntable included in Truist\u0092s most recently filed\nForm 10-K,sets forth, for Truist\u0092s equity\ncompensation plans (other than the ESPP and\nthe 2022 Incentive Plan), the number of shares\nof common stock subject to outstanding\noptions, and rights to acquire such stock, the\nweighted average exercise price of those\noutstanding options and rights, and the number\nof shares of common stock remaining available\nfor future award grants as of December 31,\n2021. All of Truist\u0092s equity compensation\nplans that were in effect as of December 31,\n2021 have been approved by the shareholders of\nTruist, except for plans assumed in mergers\nand acquisitions. Please see the Equity\nCompensation Plan Information table under our\nprior Proposal 4.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    91  \n                                 \nProposal 6\u0097Shareholder Proposal Relating to an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board of Directors\nThe following proposal was submitted by\nKenneth Steiner of 14 Stoner Ave., 2M, Great\nNeck, NY 11021. Mr. Steiner owns at least 500\nshares of our common stock. The Company is not\nresponsible for the accuracy or content of the\nproposal and supporting statement presented\nbelow which, following SEC rules, are\nreproduced as received from the proponent.\nProposal 6\u0097Independent Board Chairman The\nshareholders request that the Board of\nDirectors adopt an enduring policy, and amend\nthe governing documents as necessary in order\nthat 2 separate people hold the office of the\nChairman and the office of the CEO as follows:\nSelection of the Chairman of the Board The\nBoard requires the separation of the offices\nof the Chairman of the Board and the Chief\nExecutive Officer. Whenever possible, the\nChairman of the Board shall be an Independent\nDirector. The Board has the discretion to\nselect a Temporary Chairman of the Board who\nis not an Independent Director to serve while\nthe Board is seeking an Independent Chairman\nof the Board. The Chairman shall not be a\nformer CEO of the company. This policy could\nbe phased in when there is a contract renewal\nfor our current CEO or for the next CEO\ntransition. For the good of Truist\nshareholders, management could waive any\nagreements that would delay implementation of\nthis proposal. This proposal topic won 52%\nsupport at Boeing and 54% support at Baxter\nInternational in 2020. Boeing then adopted\nthis proposal topic in 2020. The roles of\nChairman and CEO are fundamentally different\nand should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a\nChairman who is completely independent of the\nCEO and our company. This proposal topic won\nour 44% support at our 2020 annual meeting.\nThis 44% support likely equaled 51% support\nfrom the shares that have access to\nindependent proxy voting advice and are not\nforced to rely on the biased opinion of\nmanagement. Truist management should support a\nproposal that received 51% support from the\nshares that have access to independent proxy\nvoting advice. It is especially important to\nhave an independent board chair to manage our\nunwieldy Board of an astounding 22 directors.\nThis proposal typically get substantial\nsupport at companies with Boards composed of a\nmuch more reasonable 8 to 12 directors. With\nthe current CEO serving as Chair this means\ngiving up a substantial check and balance\nsafeguard that can only occur with an\nindependent Board Chairman. A lead director is\nno substitute for an independent board\nchairman. A lead director cannot call a\nspecial shareholder meeting and cannot even\ncall a special meeting of the board. A lead\ndirector can delegate most of the lead\ndirector duties to the CEO office and then\nsimply rubber-stamp it. There is no way\nshareholders can be sure of what goes on. The\nlack of an independent Board Chairman is an\nunfortunate way to discourage new outside\nideas and an unfortunate way to encourage the\nCEO to pursue pet projects that would not\nstand up to effective oversight. Please vote\nyes: Independent Board Chairman\u0097Proposal 6\nSTATEMENT OF THE TRUIST BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN\nOPPOSITION TO THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL The\nTruist Board of Directors believes that the\nproponent\u0092s proposal is not in the best\ninterests of the Company and its shareholders\nand recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094 Proposal 6 The\nBoard of Directors has carefully considered\nthe shareholder proposal and believes that the\nCompany and its shareholders are best served\nif the Board has the flexibility to decide how\nto allocate the responsibilities of the\noffices of the Chairman and of the CEO, taking\ninto consideration the unique circumstances of\nthe Company.\n                                 \n  92    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nProposal 6\u0097Shareholder Proposal Relating to an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board of Directors\nWE HAVE A ROBUST LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND AN\nEMPOWERED INDEPENDENT BOARD THAT PROVIDES\nEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT We believe that the\nCompany\u0092s robust corporate governance\nstructure enables the Board to strike the\nright balance between decisive leadership and\nrigorous independent oversight of management.\nWe put a similar proposal to a vote by our\nshareholders at our 2020 Annual Meeting.\nDespite a majority of shareholders failing to\nsupport such proposal, we still proactively\nreached out to engage with our shareholders to\nunderstand, and be responsive to, their views\non the topic. As a result of this extensive\noutreach and engagement, we updated our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines to ensure that\nthe role and responsibilities of our lead\nindependent director are delineated,\nconsistent with best practices, to provide a\ncounterbalance to the Board Chairman. We\nregularlyreview and seek to improve our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines based on a\nreview of prevailing practices among S&P 500\nfirms. In recent years, we made important\nchanges to our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, to further strengthen the role of\nthe lead independent director, including the\nauthority to:\n                                              \n    Convene, set the agenda for and preside   \n    over executive sessions of the            \n    non-management directors at each regular  \n    Board meeting.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n    Preside at all meetings of the Board at   \n    which the Chairman is not present,        \n    including executive sessions.             \n                                              \n                                              \n    Take responsibility for feedback to and   \n    engagement with the Chairman and CEO on   \n    executive sessions.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n    Suggest matters and issues for inclusion  \n    on the Board agendas and approve such     \n    agendas.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n    Have the authority to call and preside    \n    over meetings of the independent          \n    directors.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n    Approve information that is sent to the   \n    Board in preparation for and at Board     \n    meetings.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n    Approve all Board and Committee           \n    schedules to ensure that there is         \n    sufficient time for discussion of all     \n    agenda items.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n    Serve as liaison between and facilitate   \n    teamwork and communication among          \n    independent directors and the Chairman    \n    and CEO.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n    If requested by major shareholders,       \n    ensure that he or she is reasonably       \n    available for consultation and direct     \n    communication.                            \n                                              \nWith these responsibilities, the Board is\nconfident that our current leadership\nstructure enables Truist to operate in the\nlong-term interests of shareholders, while\nmaintaining a strong, independent perspective,\nproviding the necessary checks and balances\nand enabling a thoughtful and dynamic board,\nnot dominated by the views of senior\nmanagement. In March 2022, Thomas E. Skains\nwas named as our Lead Director. Mr. Skains, as\nthe former Chairman, President and CEO of\nPiedmont Natural Gas Company and a current\ndirector at each of Duke Energy Corporation\nand National Fuel Gas Company, has extensive\nexperience in leadership and director roles at\nother large publicly-traded companies,\nproviding him valuable perspective in service\nto the Truist Board. Having this strong Lead\nDirector tasked with the responsibilities\noutlined above allows effective management and\ncommunication across all of our Board. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines also require\nthat a majority of our Board of Directors, and\neach member of certain key board committees,\nthe Audit Committee, Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee and Nominating and\nGovernance Committee, be \u0093independent\u0094 under\napplicable NYSE and SEC rules. This ensures\nthat oversight of critical matters\u0097such as the\nintegrity of Truist\u0092s financial statements,\nthe compensation of our executive officers,\nthe selection and evaluation of directors, and\nthe development of corporate governance\nprinciples\u0097is entrusted to independent\ndirectors. Presently, 90% of our directors are\nindependent, and only independent directors\nare serving on the Audit Committee, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee and\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee. THE\nBOARD BELIEVES FLEXIBILITY IN BOARD LEADERSHIP\nSTRUCTURE IS MORE SUITABLE FOR US THAN A RIGID\nAND PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH. The Board considers\nthat the short- and long-term interests of the\nCompany\u0092s shareholders are currently best\nserved by Mr. Rogers serving as both Board\nChairman and CEO. The Company\u0092s performance\nwas strongunder the joint CEO/Chairman\nleadership of Mr. King, who served in both\nroles until September 12, 2021. In 2020 and\n2021,Truist performed at or near the top of\nits peer group, with top-threerankings in\nadjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted return on\naverage assets and return on tangible common\nequity, nonperforming assets, and net interest\nmargin. This performance was accomplished\nagainst the backdrop of the COVID-19pandemic\nand while working to integrate our heritage\ncompanies.The Board believes that having a\nChairman who leads the daily operations of the\nbusiness is important from a strategic vision\nand direction standpoint and has allowed the\nBoard to act quickly and be responsive to\nchallenges and opportunities as they arise. An\nalternative arrangement could limit the\nBoard\u0092s effectiveness. Moreover, our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines embody the flexibility\nthat is key to our leadership structure by\nproviding the Board with the ability to\ndetermine if the CEO should also serve as\nChairman when electing a new Chairman.\n                                 \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    93  \n                                 \nProposal 6\u0097Shareholder Proposal Relating to an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board of Directors\nThe Board believes that Truist and its\nshareholders have, and will continue to,\nbenefit from this flexibility, as our\ndirectors are well-positioned to determine our\nleadership structure given their in-\ndepthknowledge of our leadership team, our\nstrategic goals, and the opportunities and\nchallenges we face. THE CURRENT BOARD\nSTRUCTURE IS A RESULT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nAND RELATED AGREEMENTS AND DOES NOT\nNECESSARILY REFLECT LONG-TERM GOVERNANCE.\nTruist is the surviving company of the\nDecember 2019 merger of BB&T and SunTrust.\nSimilar to other \u0093merger of equals\u0094\ntransactions, the merger agreement between\nBB&T and SunTrust, which was approved by\nshareholders in July 2019 by over 98% of the\nvotes cast, provides for the individuals that\nwill serve as the Chairman and CEO of Truist\nfollowing the merger. It provided that Kelly\nS. King, the former Chairman and CEO of BB&T,\nwould serve as Chairman and CEO of Truist\nuntil September 12, 2021, at which time he\nbecame Executive Chairman through March 12,\n2022. The merger agreement further provides\nthat William H. Rogers, Jr., the former\nChairman and CEO of SunTrust, would (i) become\nour CEO at September 12, 2021, and (ii) become\nour Chairman at March 12, 2022. The merger\nagreement also requires that an independent\nLead Director be in place during all of these\nperiods. Effective contemporaneously with the\nmerger agreement, Mr. King and Mr. Rogers\nentered into individual employment agreements\nwith Truist, which set out clear, limited\nemployment terms, further reinforcing the idea\nthat the current structure was not meant to\naddress long-term governance. In particular,\npursuant to his employment agreement, Mr.\nKing\u0092s service as Chairman and CEO ran until\nSeptember 12, 2021, and his service as\nExecutive Chairman continued only through\nMarch 12, 2022, consistent with the terms of\nthe merger agreement as described above. As of\nthe date of our 2022 Annual Meeting, there\nwill be less than 8 months left on Mr. Rogers\u0092\nemployment agreement. Truist intends for Mr.\nRogers to serve without an individual\nemployment agreement when his current\nemployment agreement expires on December 6,\n2022. These short-term arrangements were meant\nto provide equity in the merger to each side\nand an orderly transition of leadership and\nspecifically not meant to address long-term\ngovernance. Because these are short term\narrangements, they do not enable CEO\nentrenchment or limit independent,\nshareholder-focused goal-setting by the Board.\nIn contrast, this shareholder proposal\nadversely impacts the Company\u0092s long-term\ngovernance and thus deprives Truist and our\nBoard of the flexibility we believe, for the\nreasons listed above, is imperative for any\npublic company to best serve the long-term\ninterests of its shareholders going forward.\nSimilarly, the process for the election of our\nLead Director in the merger agreement was\ndesigned to provide fairness to each side in\nthe merger and not meant to address long-term\ngovernance. Per our Bylaws, on March 12, 2022,\na new independent Lead Director was chosen by\nthe Board of Directors from among the BB&T\ncontinuing directors. That merger provision\nhas expired, and the selection of our Lead\nDirector is now governed solely by our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Skains\nwill serve in this capacity subject to the\nnormal rotation policy for Lead Director\nservice as set forth in our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines. Under our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, our Lead Director is\nappointed by the majority vote of the\nindependent directors of the Board. We believe\nthat this reversion to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines further strengthens our\ncommitment to long-term and effective\ngovernance. SHAREHOLDERS OF NUMEROUS LARGE\nPUBLIC COMPANIES HAVE VOTED AGAINST RECENT\nINDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIR PROPOSALS Shareholders\nof Russell 3000 companies have repeatedly\nvoted against independent board chair\nproposals. To this point, for Russell 3000\ncompanies with meetings between July 1, 2020\nand June 30, 2021, 36 companies received\nindependent board chair shareholder proposals\nthat were presented for a shareholder vote and\nnone were approved by shareholders.\nAdditionally five bank holding companies with\nmeetings between July 1, 2019 and June 30,\n2021 in the Russell 3000 received independent\nboard chair shareholder proposals that were\npresented for a shareholder vote, and none of\nthe proposals were approved by shareholders.\nThese statistics demonstrate that shareholders\nof other large public companies have\ndetermined that the implementation of this\ntype of proposal is not necessary and not in\nthe best interests of shareholders. * * * For\nthe reasons discussed above, our Board of\nDirectors believes that the proposal is not in\nthe best interests of the Company or its\nshareholders.\n                                 \n  94    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                 \nStock Ownership Information The table below\nsets forth the beneficial ownership of Truist\ncommon stock as of December 31, 2021 by (i)\nall directors, (ii) the named executive\nofficers in this proxy statement (or NEOs),\n(iii) all then-current directors and executive\nofficers of Truist as a group, and (iv) each\nperson who is known by Truist to be the\nbeneficial owner of more than five percent of\nour common stock.

Votes Required, Non-\nVotes,Abstentions, and Revocations For the\nelection of directors, each director nominee\nmust receive the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of votes cast in order to be elected.\nProposals 2 through 6 require the affirmative\nvote of a majority of votes cast on each\nproposal. A broker or other nominee may\ngenerally vote your shares without instruction\non routine matters but not on non-\nroutinematters. A broker \u0093non-vote\u0094occurs when\nyour broker submits a proxy for your shares\nbut does not indicate a vote for a particular\n\u0093non-routine\u0094proposal because your broker does\nnot have authority to vote on that proposal\nand has not received specific voting\ninstructions from you. Brokers and other\nnominees who are New York Stock Exchange\nmembers are expected to have discretionary\nvoting power only for Proposal 2, the\nratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as\nour independent auditor, but not for any other\nproposals. As a result, if you do not provide\nspecific voting instructions to your record\nholder, New York Stock Exchange rules will\nallow the record holder to vote only on\nProposal 2, and not on Proposals 1 or\n3-6.Broker non-votes,as well as abstentions,\nwill be counted in the number of shares\nrepresented for purposes of determining\nwhether a quorum is present, but they will not\nbe counted as votes cast for or against any of\nthe proposals, and therefore will not affect\nthe outcome of the vote. Holders of our common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights in\nthe election of directors. A proxy may be\nrevoked by a shareholder at any time before it\nis exercised by filing with the Corporate\nSecretary of Truist an instrument revoking it,\nfiling a duly executed proxy bearing a later\ndate (including a proxy given over the\nInternet or by telephone), or by attending the\nannual meeting and electing to vote using the\nvirtual platform. Even if you plan to attend\nthe virtual annual meeting, you are encouraged\nto vote your shares by proxy. Delivering Proxy\nMaterials We deliver proxy materials primarily\nthrough the Internet in accordance with SEC\nrules. In addition to reducing the amount of\npaper used in producing these materials, this\nmethod lowers the costs associated with\nmailing the proxy materials to shareholders.\nShareholders who own Truist common shares\ndirectly and not through a bank, broker or\nnominee (\u0093record holders\u0094) will have proxy\nmaterials or the Notice of Internet\nAvailability of Proxy Materials delivered\ndirectly to their mailing address or\nelectronically if they have previously\nconsented to delivery by email.

For 2021, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee made adjustments to\nTruist\u0092s GAAP net income, as set forth in the\ntables below (\u0093Adjusted Net Income\u0094).\nTypically, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee adjusts Truist\u0092s GAAP net income for\ngains or losses on sales of businesses,\nmerger-related and restructuring charges and\nsimilar non-coreperformance items, on a pre-\ntaxbasis, provided the adjustment is not\nsolely a tax-relateditem. Results for 2021\nalso included adjustments for unusual economic\nactivity including net charge-offs, credit\nreserve releases under CECL, investment\nsecurities volume, and merger expenses, in\ncomparison to planned levels. These\nadjustments are made so that participants are\ncompensated for Truist\u0092s core performance and\nare neither penalized nor rewarded for non-\ncorecharges, unusual gains, or similar non-\ncoreevents. Executive Leadership also uses\nthese financial measures in evaluating\nTruist\u0092s financial performance. To the extent\npracticable, the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee also makes similar\nadjustments to the reported performance of\npeer group members for awards that measure\nTruist\u0092s performance relative to the peer\ngroup. The adjustments for 2021 affect the\nAnnual Incentive Performance awards\u0092\nperformance metrics, earnings per share and\nreturn on assets, and the three-year average\nROCE for LTIP and PSU purposes. Truist derives\neach of these non-GAAPperformance metrics from\nits Adjusted Net Income, which is a non-\nGAAPfinancial measure, and accordingly, each\nof these adjusted financial measures is\ndetermined by methods other than in accordance\nwith GAAP. The adjusted earnings per share and\nreturn on assets measures are each calculated\nin the same manner as their GAAP counterparts,\nexcept that Adjusted Net Income for the\napplicable performance metric is substituted\nfor its GAAP counterpart in each calculation.\nPlease refer to the LTIP and PSU adjustments\ntable and accompanying narratives for\nadditional detail on the ROCE calculations and\nGAAP reconciliation. 2021 Adjusted Net Income\nfor Annual Incentive Performance Award\n                                              \n          Retu\u2026              Earn\u2026            \n          on                 per              \n          Asse\u2026              Share            \n          Meas\u2026              Meas\u2026            \n          -$ in                               \n          mill\u2026                               \n  2021                                        \n  GAAP           $6,4\u2026                        \n  Net                                         \n  Inc\u2026                                        \n  2021                                        \n  GAAP                                        \n  Net                                         \n  Inc\u2026                              $6,0\u2026     \n  Ava\u2026                                        \n  to                                          \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  Sha\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  Hum\u2026                                        \n  Cap\u2026                                        \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  App\u2026                                        \n  Adj\u2026                                        \n  Gain                                        \n  on                                          \n  ear\u2026                                 (4  )  \n  ext\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  debt                                        \n  Unu\u2026                                        \n  eco\u2026                                        \n  con\u2026                                        \n  and                               (1,9\u2026  )  \n  mer\u2026                                        \n  exp\u2026                                        \n  var\u2026                                        \n  Gain                                        \n  on                                          \n  sale             (37  )             (37  )  \n  of                                          \n  bus\u2026                                        \n  Inc\u2026                                        \n  ope\u2026                                        \n  exp\u2026                                        \n  rel\u2026             771                771     \n  to                                          \n  the                                         \n  mer\u2026                                        \n  Mer\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  res\u2026             822                822     \n  cha\u2026                                        \n  net                                         \n  Adj\u2026           1,556               (435  )  \n  Sub\u2026                                        \n  Tax                                         \n  Eff\u2026            (331  )             133     \n  of                                          \n  Adj\u2026                                        \n  Adj\u2026                                        \n  Net                                         \n  Inc\u2026                                        \n  Inc\u2026           $7,6\u2026              $5,7\u2026     \n  Ava\u2026                                        \n  to                                          \n  Com\u2026                                        \n  Sha\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n         The Compensation and Human Capital   \n         Committee uses GAAP net income       \n         available to common shareholders to  \n         calculate earnings per share         \n         performance as this reflects income  \n         attributable to each share of        \n  (1)    common stock.

If\nthere is any change in the outstanding shares\nof Common Stock because of a merger,\nconsolidation, reorganization,\nrecapitalization, stock dividend, stock split,\nreverse stock split, spin-off,combination or\nreclassification of the Common Stock, or if\nthere is a similar change in the capital stock\nstructure of Truist affecting the Common\nStock, which the Administrator determines\naffects the Common Stock such that an\nadjustment or substitution is appropriate, the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock reserved for\nissuance under the Plan shall be\ncorrespondingly adjusted, and the\nAdministrator shall make such substitutions or\nadjustments to the terms of Awards and to any\nprovisions of the Plan as the Administrator\ndeems equitable to prevent dilution or\nenlargement of Awards or as may otherwise be\nadvisable. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nunless the Administrator determines otherwise,\nthe issuance by Truist of shares of stock of\nany class, or securities convertible into\nshares of stock of any class, for cash or\nproperty, or for labor or services, either\nupon direct sale or upon the exercise of\nrights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or\nupon conversion of shares or obligations of\nTruist convertible into such shares or other\nsecurities, shall not affect, and no\nadjustment by reason thereof, shall be made\nwith respect to, outstanding Awards.

Subject to the terms of the Plan, the\nAdministrator may in its sole and absolute\ndiscretion grant Options to such eligible\nindividuals in such numbers, subject to such\nterms and conditions, and at such times as the\nAdministrator shall determine. Both Incentive\nOptions and Nonqualified Options may be\ngranted under the Plan, as determined by the\nAdministrator; provided, however, that\nIncentive Options shall only be granted to\nEmployees. To the extent that an Option is\ndesignated as an Incentive Option but does not\nqualify as such under Section 422 of the Code,\nthe Option (or portion thereof) shall be\ntreated as a Nonqualified Option. An Option\nmay be granted with or without a Related SAR.\n4.2. Option Agreement. Each Option grant shall\nbe evidenced by an Agreement that shall\nspecify the date of grant, the Option Price,\nthe term of the Option, the number of shares\nof Common Stock to which the Option pertains,\nwhether the Option is an Incentive Option or a\nNonqualified Option, the conditions upon which\nthe Option shall become vested and\nexercisable, and such other provisions as the\nAdministrator shall determine that are not\ninconsistent with the terms of the Plan. 4.3.\nOption Price; Repricing; No Reloads.

No Option may include\nprovisions that entitle a Participant to the\nautomatic \u0093reload\u0094 grant of additional Options\nin connection with the exercise or expiration\nof the original Option. 4.4. Option Period;\nExercise of Options. The Option Period shall\nbe determined by the Administrator at the time\nthe Option is granted, shall be stated in the\nAgreement, and shall not extend more than ten\n(10) years from the date on which the Option\nis granted (or five (5) years with respect to\nIncentive Options granted to a Ten Percent\nShareholder).

(a)The period or periods\nduring which, and conditions pursuant to\nwhich, an Option may become exercisable shall\nbe determined by the Administrator in its\ndiscretion, subject to the terms of the Plan.\nAn Option granted under the Plan that is\nexercisable may be exercised with respect to\nany number of whole shares less than the full\nnumber of whole shares for which the Option\ncould be exercised. A partial exercise of an\nOption shall not affect the right to exercise\nthe Option from time to time in accordance\nwith the Plan and the applicable Agreement\nwith respect to remaining shares subject to\nthe Option or Related SAR. (b)An Option that\nis exercisable may be exercised by giving\nnotice of exercise specifying the number of\nshares of Common Stock to be purchased. The\nnotice of exercise shall be in such form, made\nin such manner, and shall comply with such\nterms, conditions, and restrictions as may be\nestablished by the Administrator or its\ndesignee, which terms, conditions, and\nrestrictions need not be the same for each\ngrant or for each Participant.

Shares of Common Stock tendered or\nwithheld in payment on the exercise of an\nOption shall be valued at their Fair Market\nValue. 4.8. Nontransferability. Except as\notherwise permitted by Code Section 422, an\nIncentive Option granted to a Participant\nshall be exercisable, prior to its expiration\ndate, during the Participant\u0092s lifetime solely\nby such Participant (or in the event of such\nParticipant\u0092s legal incapacity or\nincompetency, such Participant\u0092s guardian or\nlegal representative). Incentive Options shall\nnot be transferable (including by sale,\nassignment, pledge, or hypothecation) except\nby will, the laws of intestate succession or\nbeneficiary designation (in accordance with\nSection 422 of the Code and related\nregulations, and registration provisions of\nthe Securities Act). A Nonqualified Option\ngranted to a Participant shall be exercisable,\nprior to its expiration date, during the\nParticipant\u0092s lifetime solely by such\nParticipant (or in the event such\nParticipant\u0092s legal incapacity or\nincompetency, such Participant\u0092s guardian or\nlegal representative).

No right or interest of a Participant in\nany Option shall be liable for, or subject to,\nany lien, obligation, or liability of such\nParticipant. The designation of a beneficiary\nin accordance with Section 13.9 shall not\nconstitute a prohibited transfer. 4.9.\nDisqualifying Dispositions. If shares of\nCommon Stock acquired upon exercise of an\nIncentive Option are disposed of within two\n(2) years following the date of grant or one\n(1) year following the transfer of such shares\nto a Participant upon exercise, the\nParticipant shall, promptly following such\ndisposition, notify Truist in writing of the\ndate and terms of such disposition and provide\nsuch other information regarding the\ndisposition as the Administrator may\nreasonably require.\n                                  \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    107  \n                                  \nAnnex B\u0097Truist Financial Corporation 2022\nIncentive Plan 4.10.

No SAR may\ninclude provisions that entitle a Participant\nto the automatic \u0093reload\u0094 grant of additional\nSARs in connection with the exercise or\nexpiration of the original SAR. (b) SAR Award\nAgreement. Each Award of an SAR shall be\nevidenced by an Agreement that shall specify\nthe exercise price, the term of the SAR, the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock to which the\nSAR pertains, the conditions upon which the\nSAR shall become vested and exercisable, and\nsuch other provisions as the Administrator\nshall determinate that are not inconsistent\nwith the terms of the Plan.

Any SAR or portion thereof not\nexercised before expiration of the period\nestablished by the Administrator shall\nterminate. (ii)SARs may be exercised by giving\nnotice of exercise specifying the number of\nSARs being exercised. The notice of exercise\nshall be in such form, made in such manner,\nand comply with such terms, conditions, and\nrestrictions as may be established by the\nAdministrator or its designee, which terms,\nconditions, and restrictions need not be the\nsame for each grant or for each Participant.\n(g) Payment Upon Exercise.

Such\nconsideration shall be paid in cash, shares of\nCommon Stock (valued at Fair Market Value on\nthe date of exercise of the SAR), or a\ncombination of cash and shares of Common\nStock, as determined by the Administrator.\nCash payments shall be made within fifteen\n(15) business days of exercise; provided that\nif such fifteen- (15-)day period begins in one\n(1) calendar year and ends in another calendar\nyear, the Participant shall have no right to\ndesignate the calendar year of payment.

(b)All\npayroll deductions made from Participants\u0092\nCompensation shall, except to the extent\nprohibited by applicable law, be commingled\nwith the general assets of a Plan Employer,\nand no trust, segregated account or separate\nfund shall be established. Plan Employers\nshall not be obligated to pay interest on any\npayroll deductions.\n                                  \n  2022 Proxy Statement\u00a0\u00a0|    123  \n                                  \nAnnex C\u0097Truist Financial Corporation 2022\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (c)A Participant\nmay not alter the rate of payroll deductions\nduring the Offering Period; however, an\nexisting Participant may change the rate of\npayroll deductions effective for the\nimmediately succeeding Offering Period by\nfiling a revised Participation Agreement\nwithin the same deadline as applies to new\nParticipants for that Offering Period.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to\nany Offering Period, the Plan Administrator\nmay adopt and communicate a procedure to\nEligible Employees in advance of such Offering\nPeriod, pursuant to which Participants may,\nduring an Offering Period, decrease or\nincrease their rate of payroll deductions\napplicable to such Offering Period by\ncompleting and delivering a new Participant\nAgreement authorizing a new rate of payroll\ndeductions before the Purchase Date. 7.\nGranting of Purchase Rights. (a)As of the\nfirst day of each Offering Period, a\nParticipant shall be granted purchase rights\nfor a number of shares of Common Stock or\nfraction thereof, subject to the adjustments\nprovided for in Section 15, determined\naccording to the following procedure: Step 1-\nDetermine the amount of the Participant\u0092s\ntotal payroll deductions during the Offering\nPeriod; Step 2- Determine the amount of the\nPurchase Price; and Step 3- Divide the amount\ndetermined in Step 1 by the amount determined\nin Step 2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nmaximum number of shares of Common Stock for\nwhich a Participant may be granted purchase\nrights for an Offering Period is one thousand\nshares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment\nin accordance with Section 15 and the\nlimitations set forth in Section 11).\n(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the calendar\nyear limitation of Twenty-Five Thousand\nDollars ($25,000) provided in Section 3(c)\nshall apply to each Participant. 8. Exercise\nof Purchase Rights. Unless a timely withdrawal\nfrom the Plan has been effected by a\nParticipant, a Participant\u0092s rights for the\npurchase of shares of Common Stock during an\nOffering Period will be automatically\nexercised on the Purchase Date of each\nOffering Period for the purchase of the\nmaximum number of full and fractional shares\nof Common Stock which the sum of the\nParticipant\u0092s payroll deductions during the\nOffering Period can purchase at the Purchase\nPrice. During a Participant\u0092s lifetime, a\nParticipant\u0092s right to purchase shares of\nCommon Stock pursuant to the Plan is only\nexercisable by the Participant. 9. Delivery.\nAs soon as reasonably practicable after each\nPurchase Date, Truist will arrange for the\ndelivery to each Participant of the shares of\nCommon Stock purchased upon the Purchase Date\npursuant to the automatic exercise of the\nParticipant\u0092s purchase rights. The Plan\nAdministrator will require that such shares of\nCommon Stock be deposited directly into a\nShare Account established in the name of the\nParticipant with a Custodian, and may require\nthat such shares of Common Stock be retained\nin the Share Account for a specified period of\ntime. Participants will not have any voting,\ndividend or other rights of a Truist\nshareholder until such shares of Common Stock\nhave been purchased and delivered, or\ndeposited in a Share Account, pursuant to this\nSection 9. Notwithstanding any other provision\nof the Plan, unless required by applicable\nlaw, rule or regulation, Truist may, in lieu\nof delivering to any Participant certificates\nevidencing shares of Common Stock issued in\nconnection with purchases on the Purchase\nDate, record the issuance of shares of Common\nStock in the books of Truist or, as\napplicable, its transfer agent or stock plan\nadministrator. 10. Withdrawal. (a)A\nParticipant may withdraw from an Offering\nPeriod by submitting a revised Participation\nAgreement to the Plan Administrator,\nindicating his or her election to withdraw, at\nleast fifteen (15) days prior to the Purchase\nDate (or such other time period as may be\nestablished by the Plan Administrator and\ncommunicated to Eligible Employees prior to\nthe beginning date of an Offering Period).\nUpon such withdrawal by a Participant, the\naccumulated payroll deductions of such\nParticipant during such Offering Period shall\nbe paid to the Participant promptly following\ntimely receipt of the Participant\u0092s\nParticipation Agreement pursuant to which he\nor she elected to withdraw, and the\nParticipant\u0092s purchase rights shall be\nautomatically terminated. If a Participant\nwithdraws from an Offering Period during an\nOffering Period, no payroll deductions will be\nmade during any succeeding Offering Period\nunless the withdrawn Participant re-enrollsin\naccordance with Section 5; and a Participant\u0092s\nelection to withdraw during an Offering Period\nwill not affect his or her eligibility to\nparticipate in succeeding Offering Periods\nthat commence following the end of the\nOffering Period from which the Participant\nwithdrew. (b)A Participant whose employment\nterminates for any reason (including, but not\nlimited to, retirement or death) during an\nOffering Period, and prior to the Purchase\nDate of such Offering Period, will be deemed\nto have withdrawn from the Offering Period\nPlan effective immediately upon the date of\nsuch termination of employment. (c)Upon the\nwithdrawal of a Participant from the Plan\nunder the terms of this Section 10 during an\nOffering Period, the Participant\u0092s unexercised\npurchase rights under this Plan shall\nimmediately terminate, and no further shares\nof Common Stock will be purchased under the\nPlan for the Offering Period in which timely\nnotice of withdrawal is provided (or in which\nthe Participant\u0092s employment terminates, as\napplicable) or for any succeeding Offering\nPeriod, except as provided pursuant to this\nSection 10. (d)In the event of the\nParticipant\u0092s death during an Offering Period,\nall payroll deductions during such Offering\nPeriod shall be paid as provided in Section\n13.\n                                  \n  124    |\u00a0\u00a02022 Proxy Statement  \n                                  \nAnnex C\u0097Truist Financial Corporation 2022\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (e)A Participant\nwho has elected to withdraw from the Plan may\nresume participation in the same manner and\npursuant to the same rules as any Eligible\nEmployee making an initial election to\nparticipate in the Plan pursuant to Section 5.\n11. Shares of Common Stock. (a)The total\nnumber of shares of Common Stock to be sold to\nParticipants under the Plan shall be sixty-\nfive million (65,000,000) shares of Common\nStock, subject to adjustment as provided in\nSection 15. The shares of Common Stock to be\nsold to Participants under the Plan, may\ninclude shares originally issued for such\npurpose, or shares purchased in the open\nmarket. If the total number of shares of\nCommon Stock then available under the Plan for\nwhich purchase rights are to be exercised in\naccordance with Section 8 exceeds the number\nof such shares of Common Stock then available\nunder the Plan, Truist shall make a pro rata\nallocation of the shares available in as\nnearly a uniform manner as shall be\npracticable and as the Plan Administrator\nshall determine to be equitable. (b)A\nParticipant will have no interest in shares of\nCommon Stock covered by his or her purchase\nrights until shares of Common Stock are\npurchased on a Purchase Date. (c)Shares of\nCommon Stock to be delivered to a Participant\nunder the Plan will be registered in the name\nof the Participant. 12. Administration.

In\nthe event that the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock are hereafter increased or\ndecreased or changed into or exchanged for a\ndifferent number or kind of shares or other\nsecurities of Truist by reason of a\nrecapitalization, reclassification,\nreorganization, merger, consolidation, stock\nsplit, reverse stock split, spin-\noff,combination, repurchase, or exchange of\nshares of Common Stock, or other securities of\nTruist, or other change in Truist\u0092s structure\naffecting the Common Stock occurs. an\nappropriate adjustment shall be made by the\nPlan Administrator to the number and kind of\nshares available for the granting of purchase\nrights, or as to which outstanding purchase\nrights shall be exercisable, and to the\nPurchase Price. Subject to any required action\nby the shareholders of Truist, if Truist shall\nbe a party to any reorganization involving\nmerger or consolidation with respect to which\nTruist will not be the surviving entity or\nacquisition of substantially all of the stock\nor assets of Truist, the Plan Administrator in\nits discretion (a) may declare the Plan\u0092s\ntermination in the same manner as if the Board\nhad terminated the Plan pursuant to Section 16\nbelow, or (b) may declare that any purchase\nrights granted hereunder shall pertain to and\napply with appropriate adjustment as\ndetermined by the Plan Administrator to the\nsecurities of the resulting or acquiring\ncorporation to which a holder of the number of\nshares of Common Stock subject to such rights\nwould have been entitled in such transaction.\nThe grant of purchase rights pursuant to the\nPlan shall not affect in any way the right or\npower of Truist to make adjustments,\nreclassifications, reorganizations or changes\nof its capital or business structure or to\nmerge or to consolidate or to dissolve,\nliquidate or sell, or transfer all or any part\nof its business or assets. 16.
