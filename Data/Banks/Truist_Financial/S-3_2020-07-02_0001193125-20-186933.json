Effective December 6, 2019, Truist\nFinancial Corporation (previously, \u0093BB&T\nCorporation\u0094) completed its previously\nannounced merger of equals (the \u0093Merger\u0094) with\nSunTrust Banks, Inc.\n(\u0093SunTrust\u0094), pursuant to which SunTrust\nmerged with and into BB&T Corporation, with\nBB&T Corporation surviving the Merger as the\nsurviving corporation. Also in connection with\nthe Merger, we changed our name from \u0093BB&T\nCorporation\u0094 to \u0093Truist Financial Corporation\u0094\nand changed our ticker symbol to \u0093TFC.\u0094\nConcurrently with the Merger, SunTrust Bank, a\nsubsidiary that was wholly owned by SunTrust,\nmerged with and into Branch Banking and\nTrust Company, a subsidiary wholly owned by\nBB&T Corporation (\u0093Branch Bank\u0094), with Branch\nBank continuing as the surviving bank (the\n\u0093Bank Merger\u0094). In connection with the Bank\nMerger, Branch Bank changed its name to\n\u0093Truist Bank.\u0094\n\nWe conduct our business operations primarily\nthrough our commercial bank subsidiary, Truist\nBank, which has\noffices in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida,\nGeorgia, South Carolina, Maryland, Kentucky,\nWest Virginia, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee,\nWashington D.C., Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\nIndiana, Ohio, Arkansas and Mississippi.

As of March 31, 2020, we had\nconsolidated total assets of $506.2 billion,\nconsolidated loans and leases held for\ninvestment of $319.2 billion, consolidated\ndeposits of $350.2 billion and\nconsolidated shareholders\u0092 equity of $66.1\nbillion.\n\nOur common stock is traded on the New York\nStock Exchange\n(\u0093NYSE\u0094) under the symbol \u0093TFC.\u0094 Our executive\noffices are located at 214 North Tryon Street,\nCharlotte, North Carolina 28202, and our\ntelephone number is (336) 733-2000.\n\nWe refer you to the documents incorporated by\nreference in this prospectus supplement and\nthe accompanying prospectus, as described in\nthe\nsection \u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nin the accompanying prospectus, for more\ninformation about us and our businesses.\n\n7\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nOur business is subject to uncertainties and\nrisks. You should carefully consider and\nevaluate all of the information included and\nincorporated by reference in this prospectus,\nincluding the risk factors incorporated by\nreference from Truist\u0092s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and\nour Quarterly\nReport on 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,\n2020 under the sections entitled \u0093Item 1A.\nRisk Factors,\u0094 and from time to time in other\ndocuments we file with the SEC. We encourage\nyou to read\nthese risk factors in their entirety. In\naddition to these risks, other risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or\nthat we currently deem immaterial may also\nadversely affect our business operations and\nfinancial condition. Such risks\ncould cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from anticipated results. This\ncould cause the trading price of our common\nstock to decline, perhaps significantly, and\nyou may lose part or all of your investment.\n\n8\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN\n\nThe Plan permits participants to purchase\nadditional shares of common stock by\nreinvesting cash dividends on the shares and\nby making optional\ncash payments as described below. The\nfollowing is a statement of the material\nfeatures of the Plan in a question and answer\nformat. If you are a shareholder, but do not\nparticipate in the Plan, you will continue to\nreceive cash dividends, as\ndeclared, in the usual manner.\n\nThis prospectus supersedes any prior Plan\nprospectuses in their entirety.\n\nPurpose\n                                        \n  1.  What is the purpose of the Plan?  \n                                        \nThe purpose of the Plan is to provide holders\nof record of Truist\u0092s common stock, and\ninterested investors, with a simple, cost-\neffective\nand convenient method of acquiring additional\nshares of our common stock by the reinvestment\nof cash dividends and through optional cash\npayments, in both cases at market-based prices\n(as described in Question 14, below).\nReinvestment of dividends\nwill be effected without payment of any\nbrokerage fees or commissions, service charges\nor other expenses for such purchases. Optional\ncash payments will be effected subject to the\nfees described in Question 11 below. Shares\nfor the Plan either will\ncome from Truist\u0092s authorized but unissued\ncommon stock or will be purchased for\nparticipants in open market transactions or in\nprivately-negotiated transactions. To the\nextent shares are purchased directly from\nTruist, funds received by Truist\nfor such shares will be used for general\ncorporate purposes.\n\nParticipation Alternatives\n                                              \n  2.  What alternatives are available to      \n      participants in the Plan?               \n                                              \nAs a participant in the Plan you may elect one\nof the following three alternatives:\n\nA. Full Dividend Reinvestment: You may have\ncash dividends on all of your shares credited\nto your Plan account and those\nregistered in your name in certificate and/or\nbook-entry form automatically reinvested. You\nalso may make optional cash payments of not\nless than $25 per payment but limited to\naggregate payments of $25,000 per calendar\nmonth.\n\nB. Partial Dividend Reinvestment: You may have\ncash dividends on less than all of your shares\nregistered in your name in\ncertificate and/or book-entry form\nautomatically reinvested, while continuing to\nreceive cash dividends on the other shares. As\nis the case with the Full Dividend\nReinvestment option, the right to make\noptional cash payments of not less than $25\nper\npayment up to a total of $25,000 per calendar\nmonth will also be available under the Partial\nDividend Reinvestment option.\n\nC. All Dividends Paid in Cash (No Dividend\nReinvestment): Under this alternative, cash\ndividends declared on your shares\ncredited to your Plan account and those\nregistered in your name in certificate and/or\nbook-entry form will be paid in cash. You may\nalso make cash payments of not less than $25\nper payment but limited to aggregate payments\nof $25,000 per calendar\nmonth.\n\nIf you choose partial dividend reinvestment or\nall dividends paid in cash (no dividend\nreinvestment), you can have your cash\ndividends deposited directly into your bank\naccount instead of receiving a check by mail.\nTo\n\n9\n\nhave your cash dividends deposited\nelectronically, you must either enroll for\ndirect deposit online at or complete and\nsubmit an Authorization for Electronic\nDirect Deposit, which may be obtained from the\nPlan Administrator. Please allow 30 days from\nthe date of the Plan Administrator\u0092s receipt\nof a properly submitted form for the direct\ndeposit to be established. You may also change\nyour designated\nbank account for direct deposit or discontinue\nthis feature online or by submitting written\nnotice to the Plan Administrator at the\naddress noted in Question 7, below.\n\nAdvantages\n                                              \n  3.  What are some of the advantages to      \n      participating in the Plan?              \n                                              \nA. No brokerage fees or commissions, service\ncharges or other direct expenses will be paid\nby you in connection with\nreinvesting dividends under the Plan. Any such\ndividend reinvestment related expenses will be\npaid by Truist.\n\nB. The funds\npaid for shares will be fully invested because\nthe Plan permits fractions of shares of common\nstock to be credited to your account. See\nQuestions 14 and 15, below.\n\nC. You will avoid the need for safekeeping of\nstock certificates for shares of common stock\ncredited to your account under the\nPlan. For safekeeping, you may also surrender\nto the Plan Administrator certificates for\nshares of common stock which you now hold. See\nQuestion 21, below. Similarly, you may avoid\nthe need for safekeeping stock certificates if\nyou deposit your\nshares into the direct registration system (or\n\u0093DRS\u0094). See Question 31, below.\n\nD. The regular periodic\nstatements and reports from the Plan\nAdministrator will reflect the current\nactivity under your account, including\npurchases, deposits, sales, withdrawals and\nlatest balances, which will simplify your\nrecord keeping. You may also view details\nregarding your Plan account on the Internet\nat: .\n\nDisadvantages\n                                              \n  4.  What are some of the disadvantages to   \n      participating in the Plan?              \n                                              \nA. Prior to being invested on a particular\ninvestment date, optional cash payments may\nnot be returned to participants unless a\nwritten request is received by the Plan\nAdministrator at least two business days\nbefore the applicable investment date. See\nQuestion 16, below.\n\nB. No interest will be paid on optional cash\npayments pending investment or return.\n\nC. If you send in a payment for an optional\ncash purchase, the price of the common stock\nmay go up or down before a purchase is\nmade. In addition, because the purchase price\nfor shares purchased on the open market or in\nnegotiated transactions is the weighted\naverage price at which shares are actually\npurchased for a particular investment date,\nparticipants may pay a higher\nprice for shares purchased under the Plan than\nfor shares purchased on the same investment\ndate outside of the Plan. Likewise, if you\nsell any shares of common stock held in your\nPlan account through the Agent (as defined in\nQuestion 5, below), you\nwill not be able to direct the time or price\nat which the Agent arranges for your sale, and\nthe price of the common stock may go down\nbefore the sale is made.\n\n10\n\nD. If you request the Plan Administrator to\ndirect the Agent to sell shares of\ncommon stock held in your account, you will be\ncharged brokerage commissions and transfer\ntaxes and other direct costs, if any, incurred\nin connection with such sales.\n\nE. As with any investment, investment in our\ncommon stock involves risks, including but not\nlimited to the risks that the value\nof our common stock may decrease and that\ndividends paid may decrease or be terminated\naltogether.\n\nAdministration\n                                 \n  5.  Who administers the Plan?  \n                                 \nComputershare Trust Company, N.A.\n(\u0093Computershare\u0094), has been appointed Plan\nAdministrator. It will keep records, send\nstatements of\naccount to each participant, and perform other\nadministrative duties relating to the Plan.\nThe shares of common stock purchased for you\nunder the Plan will be held for you in\nsafekeeping by Computershare until termination\nof your participation in\nthe Plan or until a written request is\nreceived from you for withdrawal of all or\npart of your shares. See Question 19 below.\nThe Plan Administrator may, in its sole\ndiscretion, use a broker-dealer (\u0093Agent\u0094) that\nis affiliated or\nunaffiliated with the Plan Administrator to\nexecute purchase or sale transactions. If you\nhave any questions, please call the Plan\nAdministrator at (800) 213-4314, visit their\nwebsite at\nor write the Plan Administrator at the address\nnoted in Question 7 below.\n\nParticipation\n                                       \n  6.  Who is eligible to participate?  \n                                       \nYou may participate in the Plan in one of two\nways. If you are a holder of Truist\u0092s common\nstock registered in your name, you are\neligible\nto participate. Shareholders of record may\nparticipate with respect to less than all of\ntheir shares of stock. If you beneficially own\nshares registered in another name (for\nexample, in the name of a broker or bank\nnominee), you must either make\nappropriate arrangements for your broker or\nnominee to participate, or you must become a\nshareholder of record by having all or a\nportion of your shares transferred to your own\nname. In addition, employees and members of\nour local advisory boards\nhave historically participated in the Plan.\n\nIf you are not currently a registered holder\nof Truist common stock but wish to participate\nin the Plan, interested investors may purchase\nshares through the direct stock purchase\nfeature. Any person or legal entity, residing\nin the United States, whether or not a\nshareholder of record of our common stock, is\neligible to participate in the\nPlan. Citizens or residents of a country other\nthan the United States, its territories and\npossessions, are eligible to participate if\nsuch participation would not violate laws\napplicable to the Company or the participant.\n                                              \n  7.  How does an eligible shareholder        \n      participate?                            \n                                              \nUnless otherwise a participant in the Plan, a\nholder of record of Truist\u0092s common stock may\nenroll in the Plan by checking the appropriate\nbox on the Enrollment Form and signing and\nreturning it to the Plan Administrator at the\naddress below. A return envelope will be\nprovided for this purpose. Where common stock\nis\n\n11\n\nregistered in more than one name (i.e., joint\ntenants, trustees, etc.), all of the\nregistered holders must sign. You may also\nenroll through the Plan Administrator\u0092s\nwebsite, at\nthrough Investor Center. See Question 9 for\nmore information on the Enrollment Form.\nTruist reserves the right to deny, modify,\nsuspend or terminate participation by any\nperson or entity.\n\nInterested investors who are not currently\nregistered holders of Truist common stock may\napply for enrollment in the Plan by completing\nall\nrequired sections of the Enrollment Form and\nsending it to the Plan Administrator. The\nEnrollment Form must be accompanied by an\ninitial cash payment in the form of a check\nmade payable (in U.S. dollars) to\nComputershare. Investors may also apply\nfor enrollment in the Plan through the Plan\nAdministrator\u0092s website, , and following the\ninstructions provided. The minimum amount for\nan initial cash investment is $200 and the\namount cannot exceed $25,000\nin a calendar month. You may also authorize\nthe necessary number of automatic monthly\ndeductions from your bank account required to\nfund your initial investment. Automatic\ndeductions will continue at the level you set\nuntil you change your\ninstructions by notifying the Plan\nAdministrator. A $10 initial investment fee\nwill be deducted from the initial investment\npayment. Do not send cash, money orders,\ntraveler\u0092s checks or third party checks.\n\nIf the Plan account will be in more than one\nname, all potential participants must sign the\nEnrollment Form. The Plan Administrator\nreserves\nthe right to limit or combine Plan accounts\nwith identical taxpayer identification numbers\nand legal registrations. Certain other forms\nrequired by the Internal Revenue Service or\nother regulatory bodies may be required to\ncomplete your enrollment.\n\nAll questions and communications regarding the\nPlan may be addressed to the Plan\nAdministrator at the following addresses:\n                                              \n  Mail by regular       Overnight             \n  delivery:             correspondence:       \n  Truist Financial      Truist Financial      \n  Corporation           Corporation           \n  c/o Computershare     c/o Computershare     \n  Direct Stock          Direct Stock          \n  Purchase and          Purchase and          \n  Dividend              Dividend              \n  Reinvestment Plan     Reinvestment Plan     \n  P.O.

When may an eligible shareholder        \n      enroll in the plan?                     \n                                              \nAn eligible shareholder may enroll in the Plan\nat any time. If you elect only to have\ndividends reinvested on your shares (and not\nto make\noptional cash purchases), you will begin to\nparticipate in the Plan as of the dividend\npayment date associated with the first\ndividend record date which occurs after the\ndate the Plan Administrator processes your\nproperly-submitted Enrollment Form.\nThe dividend record dates usually precede the\ndividend payment dates by approximately two to\nthree weeks. If, when you enroll, you elect to\nmake optional cash payments, you must deliver\na properly-submitted Enrollment Form and cash\npayments to the\nPlan Administrator no less than three calendar\ndays before an investment date in order to\nallow time to enroll in the Plan and for\npurchases to be made on your behalf on that\ninvestment date. See Question 16, below, for\nmore information about\noptional cash purchases.\n\n12\n                                              \n  9.  What does the Enrollment Form provide?  \n                                              \nThe Enrollment Form provides for the purchase\nof additional shares of Truist\u0092s common stock\nthrough the following investment options:\n\nA. Full Dividend Reinvestment. This\nalternative directs the investment, in\naccordance with the Plan, of the cash\ndividends on all of the shares of common stock\nthen or subsequently registered in your name\nand on all shares of common stock then or\nsubsequently held in your Plan account\n(including fractional shares and shares\npurchased with optional cash\npurchases under the Plan), and also permits\nyou to make optional cash payments for the\npurchase of additional shares in accordance\nwith the Plan.\n\nB. Partial Dividend Reinvestment. This\nalternative directs the Plan Administrator, in\naccordance with the Plan, to\nreinvest the cash dividends on the number of\nwhole shares that you designate from those\ncredited to your Plan account and those\nregistered in your name in certificate and/or\nbook-entry form. The dividends on all\nremaining shares and on any future\nholdings, including those purchased with\noptional cash payments will be paid in cash.\nThis alternative also permits you to make\noptional cash payments for the purchase of\nadditional shares in accordance with the Plan.\n\nC. All Dividends Paid in Cash (No Dividend\nReinvestment). Under this alternative, cash\ndividends on shares of common\nstock then or subsequently registered in your\nname and on all shares of common stock then or\nsubsequently held in your Plan account are\npaid in cash. This alternative also permits\nyou to make optional cash payments for the\npurchase of additional\nshares of common stock in accordance with the\nPlan, but without any reinvestment of cash\ndividends.\n\nYou may select either one of the\ndividend reinvestment alternatives or the all\ndividends paid in cash (no dividend\nreinvestment) alternative.\n\nIf you submit an Enrollment Form properly\nexecuted but with no investment alternative\ndesignated, you will be enrolled in the \u0093Full\nDividend Reinvestment\u0094 option.\n                                              \n       How may a participant change           \n  10.  participation alternatives under the   \n       Plan?                                  \n                                              \nAs a participant, you may change your\ninvestment alternatives at any time by\nrequesting a new Enrollment Form and returning\nit to the Plan\nAdministrator at the address set forth in\nQuestion 7. See also Questions 8 and 9. You\nmay also make most changes regarding\ninvestment alternatives through the Internet\nat: or by notifying the Plan Administrator\nby telephone as described Question 5. If a\nproperly-submitted Enrollment Form changing\nthe reinvestment of cash dividends is received\nbefore the record date for payment of the\nrelated cash dividend, the change generally\nwill be effective on the\nrelated dividend payment date. If the\nEnrollment Form is received later than the\nrecord date, the change generally will be put\ninto effect on the next cash dividend payment\ndate.\n\nCosts\n                                              \n       Are there any expenses to              \n  11.  participants in connection with        \n       purchases or sales under the Plan?     \n                                              \nWe will pay all administrative costs\nassociated with the reinvestment of dividends\nunder the Plan. If you choose to make\noptional cash purchases under the Plan, the\nPlan Administrator will charge participants a\nprocessing fee of $0.05 per share. The\nprocessing fee includes any brokerage\ncommissions the Plan\n\n13\n\nAdministrator is required to pay. In addition,\nthe Plan Administrator will charge\nparticipants a $5 transaction fee for optional\ncash payments made by check or\none-time online ACH, and a $2.50 transaction\nfee for each optional cash payment made by\nrecurring debit from a U.S. bank account.\n\nIf you request the Plan Administrator to\ndirect the Agent to sell shares held in your\naccount, or if any fractional shares are sold\nfor your\naccount, a brokerage commission will be\ndeducted from the proceeds of the sale, and\nyou will be responsible for transfer taxes,\nservice fees or other similar costs, if any,\nrelated to the transfer of shares made at your\ndirection. See Questions 23-25, below. Truist\nwill pay all costs of administration of the\nPlan. We reserve the right to establish or\nchange service charges in connection with the\nPlan in the future, and you will be notified\nif any such\nchanges take effect.\n\nPurchases\n                                              \n  12.  What is the source of shares           \n       purchased under the Plan?              \n                                              \nShares purchased under the Plan either will\ncome from Truist\u0092s authorized but unissued\nshares or from shares purchased for\nparticipants\u0092 accounts on the open market or\nin privately-negotiated transactions. Truist\nwill decide whether to purchase shares on the\nopen market or to issue new shares based on\nTruist\u0092s equity position, the market price of\nour common\nstock, general market conditions, Truist\u0092s\ncurrent and expected capital needs, and other\nrelevant factors. However, neither Truist nor\nany participant will have authority to direct\nthe time or price at which shares may be\npurchased on the open\nmarket or the selection of the broker or\ndealer through or from whom purchases are to\nbe made.\n                                              \n  13.  How many shares will be purchased for  \n       each participant?                      \n                                              \nThe number of shares purchased for your\naccount will depend on the amount of your cash\ndividends and/or optional cash payments, the\npurchase\nprice per share and any fees incurred. Your\naccount will be credited with that number of\nshares, including fractional shares, equal to\nthe total amount to be invested, divided by\nthe applicable purchase price per share of the\ncommon stock.\n                                              \n       How is the purchase price determined   \n  14.  for shares of common stock purchased   \n       under the Plan?                        \n                                              \nFor shares purchased in open market\ntransactions or in privately negotiated\ntransactions, the Plan Administrator may\ncombine your purchase requests with other\npurchase requests received from other Plan\nparticipants and will generally batch purchase\ntypes (dividend and optional cash payments)\nfor separate execution by the Plan\nAdministrator\u0092s broker. The Plan\nAdministrator may also direct its broker to\nexecute each purchase type in several batches\nthroughout a trading day. Depending on the\nnumber of shares being purchased and current\ntrading volume in the shares, the Plan\nAdministrator\u0092s broker may\nexecute purchases for any batch or batches in\nmultiple transactions and over more than one\nday. If different purchase types are batched,\nthe price per share of the common shares\npurchased for each participant\u0092s account,\nwhether purchased with\nreinvested dividends, with initial cash or\nwith optional cash, shall be the weighted\naverage price of the specific batch for such\nshares purchased by the Plan Administrator\u0092s\nbroker on that day to satisfy Plan\nrequirements.\n\nFor shares purchased directly from Truist, a\nparticipant\u0092s purchase price will be the\naverage of the high and low sales prices of\nthe\ncommon stock on the NYSE on the applicable\ninvestment date. If there are no trades on\n\n14\n\nthat date, or if trading is halted or\nsuspended on that date or if publication of\nthe sales prices of the common stock does not\ntake place or contains a reporting error, the\npurchase price will\nbe determined on the basis of such market\nquotations as Truist deems appropriate. See\nQuestion 15, below.\n\nTruist reserves the right to\npermit shares purchased with dividend\nreinvestments or optional cash purchases, or\nboth, to be purchased at a discount price per\nshare as solely determined by Truist, upon\ngiving participants reasonable prior written\nnotice of the discount. If\ninstituted, the discount may thereafter be\nchanged or discontinued, upon giving\nparticipants similar notice.\n\nThe determination of the\npurchase price for shares made in accordance\nwith this question is solely for the purpose\nof determining the number of shares to be\npurchased for each participant\u0092s account and\ndoes not determine the participant\u0092s tax basis\nin the shares\nso purchased. See Questions 29 and 30, below.\n                                              \n  15.  When will purchases of shares of       \n       common stock be made?                  \n                                              \nThe shares of common stock to be purchased for\nparticipants will be allocated to their\naccounts as of, or as soon as practicable\nfollowing, the\napplicable investment date. For the\nreinvestment of cash dividends, the investment\ndate will be the regular cash dividend payment\ndate, which is currently the first day of\nMarch, June, September and December. For the\ninvestment of optional cash\npayments, purchases will be made weekly\n(generally on Fridays, or if not a trading\nday, then on the next trading day). Optional\ncash payments must be received at least one\nbusiness day before the applicable investment\ndate. However, we reserve the\nright to make purchases with optional cash\npayments more or less frequently than as\ndescribed above. See Question 16, below.\nPurchases of authorized but unissued shares of\nour common stock directly from us will be made\nas of each investment date and\nwill include the optional cash payments and\ndividends to be reinvested as of each\ninvestment date, as applicable. Purchases by\nthe Plan Administrator or a broker-dealer\nselected by the Plan Administrator through\nopen market transactions (or in\nprivately-negotiated transactions) will begin\non or after the investment date, and will be\ncompleted as soon as reasonably practicable,\nbut not later than 30 days after the\napplicable investment date. However, the exact\ntiming and related aspects of\npurchases may be subject to certain conditions\nwhich may prevent the purchase of common stock\nor interfere with the timing of purchases. No\ninterest will be paid on any funds received\nunder the Plan pending investment. You may\nview details regarding\nyour pending investment through Investor\nCenter at: .\n\nOptional Cash Payments\n                                              \n  16.  How may optional cash payments be      \n       made?                                  \n                                              \nThe optional cash payments received from a\nparticipant will be accumulated with the\noptional cash payments of all participants,\ninclusive of\nthe cash dividends held for reinvestment on\nthe same investment date. These accumulated\namounts will be used to purchase shares of\ncommon stock directly from Truist or on the\nopen market or in privately-negotiated\ntransactions, as of, or as soon as\npracticable following, the relevant investment\ndate. The price of the shares of common stock\npurchased with the optional cash payments will\nbe determined as described in Question 14.\nOptional cash payments received less than two\nbusiness days\nimmediately preceding an investment date\ngenerally will be held by the Plan\nAdministrator until the next investment date;\nprovided, however, that no optional cash\npayments will be held for more than 25\ncalendar days.\n\n15\n\nIn the event of the inability of the Plan\nAdministrator to purchase shares within 30\ndays of an\napplicable investment date, the optional cash\npayments received prior to the 25th day\npreceding the investment date on which they\ncould have been invested will be returned to\nthe participant. No interest will be paid on\noptional cash payments held\npending investment. Consequently, you are\nstrongly urged to make your optional cash\npayments as close as possible to the second\nbusiness day immediately preceding the next\nappropriate investment date. In this regard,\nyou should allow sufficient time\nto ensure that your payment is received by the\nPlan Administrator two business days before\nthese dates. A shareholder may participate in\nthe Plan even if he wishes to make optional\ncash payments only.\n\nAn optional cash payment will be refunded if a\nwritten request for refund is received by the\nPlan Administrator at least two business days\nprior to the next applicable investment date\non which the cash payment otherwise would have\nbeen invested.\n\nAn optional cash payment may\nbe made by a participant at the time of\nenrolling in the Plan by enclosing with the\nEnrollment Form a check made payable to\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A., as Plan\nAdministrator. The Plan Administrator will not\naccept cash, traveler\u0092s\nchecks, money orders, or third party checks\nfor optional cash payments. Thereafter, the\noptional cash payments may be made (generally,\non a weekly basis) through use of the cash\npayment forms, which will be attached to\nstatements of account sent by\nthe Plan Administrator to participants.\nGenerally, the same amount need not be sent\neach month, and there is no obligation to make\nan optional cash payment for each or any\ninvestment date. Optional cash payments must\nbe received at least one\nbusiness day prior to the applicable\ninvestment date.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to make optional\ncash payments online through\nInvestor Center on the Plan Administrators\u0092\nwebsite, . There you can make a one-time\nonline bank debit from your U.S. bank or\nfinancial institution instead of mailing\na check.\n\nYou may also elect to make optional cash\npayments by authorizing automatic monthly\ndebits from your U.S. bank or financial\ninstitution. Automatic debits can be\nauthorized through Investor Center on the Plan\nAdministrator\u0092s website, or by mailing a\nDirect Debit Authorization form to the Plan\nAdministrator. The debit must be in\nthe same amount each month and will continue\nuntil you notify the Plan Administrator that\nyou wish to change the amount or terminate the\ndirect debits. Automatic debits generally\noccur on the 23rd of each month or the next\nbusiness day if the 23rd\nis not a business day and purchases with such\namounts generally are made on the next\ninvestment date after the debit date.\n\nThe minimum\noptional cash payment by a participant is $25\nper payment, and the aggregate of such\npayments received by the Plan Administrator in\nany one calendar month cannot exceed a total\nof $25,000 for any participant. Truist may,\nfrom time to time, change\nthe minimum or maximum amounts of optional\ncash payments per month upon notice to you.\n\nIn the event that any check or other deposit\nis\nreturned unpaid for any reason, or pre-\ndesignated bank account does not have\nsufficient funds for an automatic debit, the\nPlan Administrator will consider the request\nfor investment of that purchase null and\nvoid and will immediately remove from your\naccount any shares already purchased in\nanticipation of receiving those funds. If the\nnet proceeds from the sale of those shares are\ninsufficient to satisfy the balance of the\nuncollected amounts, the Plan\nAdministrator may sell additional shares from\nyour account as necessary to satisfy the\nuncollected balance. There is a fee\n(currently, $35) for any check or\n\n16\n\nother deposit that is returned unpaid by your\nbank and for any failed automatic deduction\nfrom your pre- designated U.S. bank account.\nThis fee will be\ncollected by the Plan Administrator through\nthe sale of the number of shares from your\naccount necessary to satisfy the fee.\n\nReports to Participants\n                                              \n  17.  What kind of reports will be sent to   \n       participants in the Plan?              \n                                              \nAs soon as practicable after a transaction is\nmade for a participant\u0092s account under the\nPlan, the Plan Administrator will provide the\nparticipant with a statement reflecting the\namount, per share price (where applicable) and\nnumber of whole shares and fractional\ninterests purchased, sold, withdrawn or\ndeposited for the participant\u0092s account. These\nstatements and reports are your continuing\nrecord of account activity and the cost basis\nof your purchases and the proceeds of sales\nand thus should be retained for tax purposes.\nThe cost basis of shares is reported as part\nof year-endtax filings when calculating the\ngain or loss for the sale of shares. Each\nparticipant is responsible for maintaining\nrecords regarding the cost basis and purchase\nprices of all shares credited to his account.\nParticipants are urged to consult their own\ntax adviser in computing their cost basis.\n\nIn addition, you will receive copies\nof the same shareholder communications sent to\nevery shareholder of the Company stock and any\nreports of taxable income as may be required\nby the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nYou may also view details regarding your Plan\naccount on the Internet at: .\n\nDividends\n                                              \n       Will participants be credited with     \n       cash dividends on whole and            \n  18.  fractional shares held in their        \n       accounts                               \n       under the Plan?                        \n                                              \nDividends on fractional and whole shares held\nin a participant\u0092s account will be reinvested\nin\nadditional shares and credited to the\nparticipant\u0092s account if the participant has\nselected the \u0093Full Dividend Reinvestment\u0094 or\n\u0093Partial Dividend Reinvestment\u0094 alternative\n(see Question 9). Participants who have\nelected to\npurchase shares with optional cash payments\nonly will receive cash dividends on all\nshares, including shares purchased under the\nPlan, in the usual manner.\n\nCertificates for Shares\n                                              \n  19.  Will stock certificates be issued for  \n       the shares of common stock purchased?  \n                                              \nCertificates for the shares of common stock\npurchased under the Plan will not be issued\ndirectly to you, unless requested as provided\nbelow.\n\nAll shares credited to your Plan account will\nbe held by the Plan Administrator or its\nnominee as your agent. The number of shares\ncredited to your account under the Plan will\nbe shown on your account statement. This\nadditional service protects against loss,\ntheft or destruction of stock certificates. If\nyou wish to transfer your shares out of the\nPlan, the Plan Administrator\nwill issue shares in book-entry form through\nthe direct registration system. In that case,\nthe Plan Administrator will send a DRS book-\nentry statement reflecting the full shares\n\n17\n\nissued to you within approximately five\nbusiness days of the date of transfer. You can\nobtain information about direct registration\nat any time by calling (800)\n213-4314 or by written request to the Plan\nAdministrator at the address set forth in\nQuestion 7. Fractional share interests will\nnot be issued in certificate or DRS book-entry\nform under any circumstances. Any\nfractional shares will be sold and a check for\nthe net proceeds resulting from the sale will\nbe sent to the participant, less any brokerage\ncommissions and service fees. You may request\nthat certificates for any number of whole\nshares credited to\nyour account be issued to you without charge\nupon written request to the Plan\nAdministrator.\n                                              \n       In whose name will certificates be     \n  20.  registered when issued to              \n       participants?                          \n                                              \nThe accounts under the Plan will be maintained\nin the name in which your shares are\nregistered at the time you elect to enroll in\nthe Plan.\nConsequently, any shares withdrawn from the\nPlan and issued in DRS book-entry form under\nthe direct registration system (see Questions\n19 and 23) as whole shares purchased under the\nPlan will be similarly registered when\ndelivered to you upon your\nrequest. You may request certificates for\nwhole shares of stock you are withdrawing from\nthe Plan instead of receiving the DRS book-\nentry shares. Should you want the shares you\nwithdraw from the Plan registered and reissued\nin a different name, you\nmust so indicate by a proper written request\nbearing the registered owner\u0092s signature(s)\nwhich has been guaranteed by an authorized\nfinancial institution, broker-dealer or other\nentity participating in the Medallion\nGuarantee Program. The\nMedallion Guarantee Program is designed to\nensure that the individual signing the\ncertificate or stock power is in fact the\nregistered owner. Since this would constitute\na reregistration, you would be responsible for\ntransfer taxes, if any, that may\nbe due and for compliance with any other\napplicable transfer requirements.\n                                              \n  21.  Does the Plan provide for safekeeping  \n       of share certificates?                 \n                                              \nYes. If you are a participant in the Plan,\ncertificates for shares of stock you hold of\nrecord may be sent to the Plan Administrator\n(at the\naddress set forth in Question 7) requesting\nthat they be deposited into the Plan for\nsafekeeping. In that event, the shares\nrepresented by the certificates will be\nallocated to your Plan account. Truist\nprovides this safekeeping feature free of\ncharge. You should send such certificates by\nregistered mail, return receipt requested, and\ninsure them for an amount sufficient to cover\nthe bond premium that would be charged to\nreplace the certificates if they were lost or\ndestroyed.\nAdditionally, you may deposit shares you hold\nin the DRS book-entry system into the Plan.\nSee Question 31, below.\n\nParticipants who deposit share certificates\nfor safekeeping are responsible for\nmaintaining records reflecting the purchase\nprice and cost basis for such shares. Truist\nis not responsible for determining such\namounts. See Question 17, above.\n\nChange of Participation, Withdrawal, Sale of\nShares and Termination\n                                              \n  22.  How do participants change their       \n       method of participation?               \n                                              \nYou may change your method of participation at\nany time by indicating the change on a\nproperly submitted Enrollment Form sent to the\nPlan\nAdministrator at the address set forth in\nQuestion 7. The change to your method of\nparticipation will become effective as soon as\npracticable after the Plan Administrator has\nreceived the new Enrollment Form. You may also\nmake most changes regarding\nparticipation methods on the Internet at: or\nby notifying the Plan Administrator by\ntelephone as described Question 5.\n\n18\n                                              \n       How does a participant withdraw        \n  23.  shares held in his or her Plan         \n       account?                               \n                                              \nYou may at any time withdraw any or all whole\nshares credited to your Plan account by\nnotifying the Plan Administrator by phone, in\nwriting, or\nthrough Investor Center on the Plan\nAdministrators\u0092 website, that you wish to do\nso. Notice of withdrawal of shares should be\nsent to the address set forth in Question 7.\nUnless you request certificates for\nyour shares in writing, the Plan Administrator\nwill issue the whole shares you are\nwithdrawing in book-entry form through the\ndirect registration system. In that case, the\nPlan Administrator will send a DRS book-entry\nstatement reflecting the whole\nshares you withdrew within approximately five\nbusiness days of the date of transfer. If you\nrequest certificates for your shares, a\ncertificate for the whole shares requested to\nbe withdrawn will be issued in your name and\nmailed to you. You will\nnot receive book-entry credit or certificates\nfor fractional shares. Rather, any fractional\nshare will be sold and a check for the net\nproceeds resulting from that sale (i.e., the\nproceeds from the sale less brokerage\ncommissions, transfer taxes and\nservice fees) will be mailed to you. If the\nPlan Administrator receives a notice of\nwithdrawal near the record date for a\nparticular dividend payment for an account\nwhose dividends are to be reinvested, the Plan\nAdministrator, in its sole\ndiscretion, may either distribute such\ndividends in cash or reinvest them in shares\non behalf of the withdrawing participant. In\nthe event reinvestment is made, the Plan\nAdministrator will process the withdrawal as\nsoon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than five business days after the\ninvestment is completed.\n\nIf you have elected full dividend reinvestment\non all shares of\nstock registered in your name, the cash\ndividends on the shares withdrawn from the\nPlan will continue to be reinvested. If you\nelected partial dividend reinvestment,\ndividends will be reinvested only for the\nnumber of shares for which you have\nelected reinvestment. You may change any\nelection previously made by submitting a new\nEnrollment Form.\n\nAt your request, the Plan\nAdministrator also may sell the shares\nwithdrawn. See Question 24, below.\n                                              \n       How can shares of common stock be      \n  24.  sold and what fees will I incur for    \n       such sales?                            \n                                              \nYou can sell some or all of the shares held in\nyour account at any time by contacting the\nPlan Administrator. You have four choices when\nmaking\na sale, depending on how you submit your sale\nrequest, as follows:\n                                              \n      Market Order: A market order is a       \n      request to sell shares promptly at the  \n      current market price. Market            \n      order sales are only available by       \n      accessing your account at               \n      www.computershare.com/investor or by    \n      calling the Plan Administrator          \n      directly at (800) 213-4314. Market      \n      order sale requests received at         \n      www.computershare.com/investor or by    \n      telephone will be placed promptly upon  \n      receipt during market hours (normally   \n      9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time).   \n      Any orders received after 4:00 p.m.     \n      Eastern time will be placed promptly    \n      on the next day                         \n      the market is open. Market order sale   \n      instructions received by the Plan       \n      Administrator during market hours are   \n      final and cannot be stopped or          \n      cancelled. If you request to cancel a   \n      market order placed outside of market   \n      hours, the Plan Administrator           \n      will use commercially reasonable        \n      efforts to honor the request.           \n      Depending on the number of shares       \n      being sold and current trading volume   \n      in the shares, a market order may only  \n      be partially filled or not filled at    \n      all on the trading day in which it is   \n      placed, in which case the order, or     \n      remainder of the order, as applicable,  \n      will be cancelled at the end of such    \n      day. To determine if your shares were   \n      sold, you should check your account     \n      online at                               \n      www.computershare.com/investor or       \n      contact us                              \n      at the number listed above. If your     \n      market order sale was not filled and    \n      you still want the shares sold, you     \n      will need to re-enter the sale          \n      request. The price shall be the market  \n      price of the sale obtained by           \n      the Plan Administrator\u0092s broker, less a  \n      service fee of no more than $25 and a   \n      processing fee of no more than $0.12    \n      per share sold.                         \n                                              \n19\n                                              \n      Batch Order: A batch order is an        \n      accumulation of all sale requests for   \n      a security submitted together as a      \n      collective request. Batch orders are    \n      submitted on each market day, assuming  \n      there are sale requests to be           \n      processed. Sale instructions for batch  \n      orders received by the Plan             \n      Administrator will be processed no      \n      later than five business days after     \n      the                                     \n      date on which the order is received     \n      (except where deferral is required      \n      under applicable federal or state laws  \n      or regulations), assuming the           \n      applicable market is open for trading   \n      and sufficient market liquidity         \n      exists. Batch order sales are           \n      available                               \n      by writing or calling the Plan          \n      Administrator directly at (800)         \n      213-4314. All sales requests received   \n      in writing will be submitted as batch   \n      order sales. The Plan Administrator     \n      will cause your shares to be sold       \n      on the open market within five          \n      business days of receipt of your        \n      request. To maximize cost savings for   \n      batch order sales requests, the Plan    \n      Administrator may combine each selling  \n      program participant\u0092s shares with those  \n      of other selling program                \n      participants. In every case of a batch  \n      order sale, the price to each selling   \n      Plan participant shall be the weighted  \n      average sale price obtained by the      \n      Plan Administrator\u0092s broker for each     \n      aggregate order placed by the Plan      \n      Administrator and                       \n      executed by the broker, less a service  \n      fee of no more than $25 and a           \n      processing fee of no more than $0.12    \n      per share sold. Proceeds are normally   \n      paid by check, which are distributed    \n      within 24 hours after your sale         \n      transaction has settled.                \n                                              \n                                              \n      Day Limit Order: A day limit order is   \n      an order to sell securities when and    \n      if they reach a specific                \n      trading price on a specific day. The    \n      order is automatically cancelled if     \n      the price is not met by the end of      \n      that day (or, for orders placed         \n      after-market hours, the next day the    \n      market is open). Depending on the       \n      number of securities being sold and     \n      the current trading volume in the       \n      securities, such an order may only be   \n      partially filled, in which case the     \n      remainder of the order will be          \n      cancelled. The order may be cancelled   \n      by the applicable stock exchange, by    \n      the Plan Administrator at its sole      \n      discretion or, if the Plan              \n      Administrator\u0092s broker has not filled    \n      the order, at your request made online  \n      at www.computershare.com/investor or    \n      by calling the Plan Administrator       \n      directly at (800)                       \n      213-4314. Each day limit order sale     \n      will incur a service fee of no more     \n      than $25 and a processing fee of no     \n      more than $0.12 per share sold.         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Good-til-Cancelled (GTC) Limit          \n      Order: A GTC limit order is an order    \n      to sell securities when and if the      \n      securities reach a specific trading     \n      price at any time while the order       \n      remains open (generally up to 30        \n      days). Depending on the number of       \n      securities being sold and current       \n      trading volume in the securities,       \n      sales may be executed in multiple       \n      transactions and over more than one     \n      day. If shares are traded on more than  \n      one day during which the market is      \n      open, a separate fee will be charged    \n      for each such day. The order (or        \n      any unexecuted portion thereof) is      \n      automatically cancelled if the trading  \n      price is not met by the end of the      \n      order period. The order may be          \n      cancelled by the applicable stock       \n      exchange, by the Plan Administrator at  \n      its sole discretion or, if the Plan     \n      Administrator\u0092s broker has not filled    \n      the order, at your request made online  \n      at www.computershare.com/investor or    \n      by calling the Plan Administrator       \n      directly at (800) 213-4314. Each GTC    \n      limit order                             \n      sale will incur a service fee of no     \n      more than $25 and a processing fee of   \n      no more than $0.12 per share sold.      \n                                              \nAll per\nshare processing fees include any brokerage\ncommissions the Plan Administrator is required\nto pay. Any fractional share will be rounded\nup to a whole share for purposes of\ncalculating the per share fee. All sales\nrequests processed over the\ntelephone by a customer service representative\nentail an additional fee of $15.00. All sale\ninstructions are final when the Plan\nAdministrator receives them. Your sale\ninstructions cannot be stopped or cancelled.\nThe Plan Administrator may, for\nvarious reasons, require a transaction request\nto be submitted in writing. Please contact the\nPlan Administrator to determine if there are\nany limitations applicable to your particular\nsale request.\n\n20\n\nThe Plan Administrator will sell shares for\nyou through broker-dealers selected by the\nPlan\nAdministrator in its sole discretion, which\nbroker-dealers may be affiliated with the Plan\nAdministrator. Participants are responsible\nfor determining the tax cost basis for shares\nsold under the Plan. Truist assumes no\nresponsibility for such determinations.See\nQuestion 17, above. If you are requesting\nstock certificates or selling shares in\nconnection with terminating participation in\nthe Plan, additional restrictions may apply.\nSee also Questions 19, 25 and 26.\n\nAlternatively, you may request certificates or\nDRS book-entry for your whole shares and\narrange for the sale of these shares through a\nbroker-dealer of your choice. You will be\nresponsible for any brokerage commissions,\ntaxes and fees that may be charged by that\nbroker-dealer.\n\nPlease remember that if you elect to sell your\ncommon stock through the Plan Administrator,\nthe price of our common stock may decline\nduring\nthe period between the Plan Administrator\u0092s\nreceipt of your request and the date of the\nsale. You also assume a similar risk between\nthe time that you request and receive a\ncertificate. You should carefully evaluate\nthese risks, which you bear.\n\nParticipants who are considered Executive\nLeadership, Directors and Insiders of Truist,\nor their immediate family members\n(\u0093Insiders\u0094), are, under the Truist Financial\nCorporation Securities Trades by Company\nPersonnel Policy (the \u0093Insider Trading\nPolicy\u0094), subject to certain restrictions on\nthe timing of sales of Common Stock (See\nQuestion 35). In\naddition, all sales of shares must be made in\ncompliance with applicable state and federal\nsecurities laws. The foregoing summary does\nnot purport to describe those laws, and you\nshould consult with you own legal advisers\nregarding the applicability\nof such laws to any sale of your shares.\n                                              \n  25.  How may participation in the Plan be   \n       terminated?                            \n                                              \nYou may terminate your participation in the\nPlan by notifying the Plan Administrator in\nwriting that you wish to do so. Such notice\nshould be\nsent to the Plan Administrator at the address\nset forth in Question 7. You may also\nterminate your Plan account by phone or\nthrough Investor Center on the Plan\nAdministrator\u0092s website, . Upon termination of\nparticipation in the Plan, you may elect to\nreceive: (1) any whole shares that you hold in\nthe Plan either in certificated form or to be\nheld for you in book-entry form through the\ndirect registration system, plus a check for\nthe proceeds from\nthe sale of any fractional share (less\nbrokerage commissions, and any applicable\ntransfer taxes and service fees); or (2) a\ncheck for the proceeds from the sale of all\nshares, including any fractional share, held\nfor your account, less\nbrokerage commissions, and any applicable\ntransfer taxes and service fees. See Questions\n23 and 24, above, regarding sales of shares.\nIf the Plan Administrator receives a\ntermination notice near the record date for a\nparticular dividend payment for\nan account whose dividends are to be\nreinvested, the Plan Administrator, in its\nsole discretion, may either distribute such\ndividends in cash or reinvest them in shares\non behalf of the terminating participant. In\nthe event reinvestment is made, the\nPlan Administrator will process the\ntermination as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than five business days after the\ninvestment is completed. You can obtain\ninformation about the direct registration\nsystem at any time by calling (800) 213-4314\nor by written request to the Plan\nAdministrator at the address provided in\nQuestion 7, above.\n\nTruist reserves the right to terminate the\nparticipation of any participant in the Plan\nfor any reason and at any time.\n\n21\n                                              \n  26.  When may participation in the Plan be  \n       terminated?                            \n                                              \nYou may terminate your participation in the\nPlan at any time. Truist also may in its\ndiscretion terminate a participant\u0092s\nparticipation in\nthe Plan at any time. If the request to\nterminate is received near the record date for\na dividend for an account whose dividends are\nto be reinvested, the Plan Administrator, in\nits sole discretion, may either distribute\nsuch dividends in cash or\nreinvest them in shares on behalf of the\nwithdrawing participant. In the event\nreinvestment is made, the Plan Administrator\nwill process the withdrawal as soon as\npracticable, but in no event later than five\nbusiness days after the investment is\ncompleted. Upon termination, any optional cash\npayments sent to the Plan Administrator that\nwere not invested will be returned promptly.\n\nAll cash dividends declared after you\nterminate participation will be paid to you by\ncheck or direct deposit in the ordinary\nmanner, unless\nyou reenroll in the Plan, which you may do at\nany time (subject to Plan terms).\n                                              \n       What happens when you sell or          \n       transfer all of the certificated       \n  27.  shares and/or book-entry direct        \n       registration                           \n       shares you own?                        \n                                              \nIf you sell or transfer all shares registered\nin your name (those for which you either hold\ncertificates or for which you are the record\nowner on our direct registration system)\nwithout terminating Plan participation, the\ncash dividends on shares credited to your\naccount under the Plan will continue to be\nreinvested, as previously\ndesignated until your participation in the\nPlan is terminated. If you sell all of the\nshares of common stock you hold after a record\ndate, in certificated form and or in direct\nregistration book-entry form, you would still\nhold shares of common\nstock under the Plan because those shares are\nheld by the Plan Administrator as nominee for\nall participants in the Plan. Cash dividends\non the shares held in your Plan account,\nincluding any shares held in safekeeping,\nwould continue to be\nreinvested under the Plan until your\nparticipation is terminated.\n\nHowever, if a participant has only a\nfractional share in common stock\ncredited to the account under the Plan on the\nrecord date for cash dividends on the common\nstock, Truist reserves the right not to\nreinvest the additional dividends on such\nfractional share and to terminate such\nparticipant\u0092s account. If Truist\nexercises this right, the participant will\nreceive a check for the proceeds from the sale\nof such fractional share (less brokerage\ncommissions and applicable transfer taxes and\nservice fees), plus the amount of the cash\ndividends thereon.\n                                              \n       What happens when you sell or          \n  28.  transfer some but not all of the       \n       shares registered in your name?        \n                                              \nIf you are reinvesting the cash dividends on\nall of the shares in your name (i.e., you have\nelected the \u0093Full\nDividend Reinvestment\u0094 alternative as\ndescribed in Question 9) and you sell or\ntransfer a portion of such shares, the cash\ndividends on the remainder of the shares\nregistered in your name will continue to be\nreinvested.\n\nIf you are reinvesting the cash dividends on\nonly a portion of the shares in your name\n(that is, you have selected the \u0093Partial\nDividend\nReinvestment\u0094 alternative as discussed in\nQuestion 9), and you then dispose of a portion\nof these shares, the cash dividends on the\nlesser of (1) the number of shares with\nrespect to which reinvestment of cash\ndividends was originally\nauthorized, or (2) all of the shares which\nremain in your name will continue to be\nreinvested.\n\n22\n\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\n                                              \n       What are the federal income tax        \n  29.  consequences of participation in the   \n       Plan?                                  \n                                              \nThe following discussion summarizes certain\nU.S. federal income tax consequences, under\ncurrent law, of participation in the Plan. It\nassumes\nthat, as expected, all dividend distributions\nby Truist will be from \u0093earnings and profits\u0094\nand therefore will constitute dividends\n(rather than a return of capital) for federal\nincome tax purposes. This discussion does not\naddress all\npotentially relevant federal income tax\nmatters, including consequences peculiar to\npersons subject to special provisions of\nfederal income tax law. It is based on various\nrulings of the Internal Revenue Service\n(\u0093IRS\u0094) regarding several\ntypes of dividend reinvestment plans, but no\nruling has been issued or requested regarding\nthe Plan. The following discussion is for\ngeneral information only, and participants are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors to\ndetermine the particular\nfederal, as well as foreign, state and local,\ntax consequences that may result from\nparticipation in the Plan and the acquisition\nand disposition of any shares of common stock\npurchased pursuant to the Plan. Participants\nare responsible for determining the tax\nconsequences related to any shares purchased,\nsold, deposited or withdrawn under the Plan.\nYou should retain and refer to the periodic\nstatements and reports sent to you by the Plan\nAdministrator regarding your Plan transactions\nto assist in making such determinations.\n\nA. Reinvested Dividends. When your dividends\nare reinvested to acquire\nshares of common stock (including any\nfractional share), you will be treated as\nhaving received a taxable dividend equal to\nthe fair market value of the shares credited\nto your account. For example, if dividends of\n$100 are reinvested under the Plan\nto acquire shares of common stock with a fair\nmarket value of $100, the amount of taxable\ndividend will be $100. In addition, when\nshares are acquired for you under the Plan\nthrough open market purchases, you will be\ntreated as having received a\ndividend in the amount of your allocable\nportion of any brokerage commissions paid by\nTruist. Thus, for example, if $100 of your\ndividends is reinvested to purchase shares of\ncommon stock with a fair market value of $100\nin the open market under the\nPlan, and if your portion of brokerage\ncommissions paid by Truist is $1, the total\namount of the taxable dividend you will be\ntreated as receiving will be $101. (The $1\nfigure is for purposes of illustration only;\nit is not a representation or\nestimate of the amount or percentage of\nbrokerage commissions that may be paid under\nthe Plan.) The initial tax basis of a share of\ncommon stock you acquire with reinvested\ndividends will equal the amount of the\ndividend represented by the share,\ni.e., the share\u0092s fair market value plus, if\nthe share is acquired through an open market\npurchase, the amount of any brokerage\ncommissions allocable to the share.\n\nB. Optional Cash Payments. The purchase of\nshares of common stock under the Plan with\nyour optional cash payments will\nnot result in a taxable distribution to you\nfor federal income tax purposes (assuming the\npurchase price is at least equal to the\ncurrent market value of the common stock),\nunless the purchase is made in the open\nmarket. In the case of an open\nmarket purchase, you will be treated as\nreceiving a taxable dividend equal to your\nportion of any brokerage commissions paid by\nTruist. The initial tax basis of a share of\ncommon stock acquired with an optional cash\npayment will be the purchase\nprice plus the amount of any such brokerage\ncommissions and other transaction fees\nallocable to the share.\n\nC. Holding Period. The holding period for a\nshare of common stock acquired under the Plan\nwill begin the day after the investment date\non which the share was acquired. A whole share\nconsisting of fractional shares purchased on\ndifferent dates will have a\nsplit holding period, with the holding period\nfor each fractional component beginning the\nday after the investment date when the\nfraction was acquired.\n\nD. Receipt of Share Certificates and Cash. You\nwill not realize any income when you receive\ncertificates for whole\nshares credited to your account under the Plan\nor when such shares are issued to you\n\n23\n\nin book-entry form under DRS. See Question 31,\nbelow. Any cash received for a fractional\nshare held in your account will be treated as\nan amount realized on the sale of the\nfractional share. You\ntherefore will recognize gain or loss equal to\nany difference between the amount of cash\nreceived for a fractional share and your tax\nbasis in the fractional share. Similarly, if\nthe Plan Administrator sells shares from your\nPlan account for you,\nyou will recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the amount you realize on\nthe sale and your tax basis in the shares.\nGain or loss recognized on a sale of shares\n(including a fractional share) from your Plan\naccount generally will be\ncapital gain or loss if you hold your shares\nof common stock in the Plan as capital assets,\nand generally will be long-term capital gain\nor loss if the holding period exceeds one year\nwhen the sale occurs.\n\nE. Foreign Participants. In the case of\nforeign participants who elect to have their\ncash dividends reinvested and whose\ndividends are subject to United States income\ntax withholding, an amount equal to the cash\ndividends payable to such participants less\nthe amount of tax required to be withheld will\nbe applied to the purchase of shares of common\nstock through the\nPlan. Foreign shareholder participants are\nurged to consult their legal advisers with\nrespect to any local exchange control, tax or\nother law or regulation which may affect their\nparticipation in the Plan. Truist, the Plan\nAdministrator and the\nAgent assume no responsibility regarding such\nlaws or regulations and will not be liable for\nany act or omission in respect thereof.\n\nF. Withholding and Information Reporting.In\ngeneral, Truist is required to report to the\nInternal Revenue Service all\nactual and constructive dividend distributions\nto a shareholder. Additionally, dividends are\nsubject to United States federal backup\nwithholding at applicable rates, unless the\nshareholder provides its taxpayer\nidentification number in the manner\nprescribed in applicable Treasury Regulations,\ncertifies that such number is correct,\ncertifies as to no loss of exemption from\nbackup withholding, and meets certain other\nconditions. Any amounts withheld from payments\nto a shareholder under the\nbackup withholding rules will be allowed as a\nrefund or credit against the shareholder\u0092s\nU.S. federal income tax liability, provided\nthe required information is furnished to the\nInternal Revenue Service. See also Question\n30, below.\n\nG. Mandatory Cost-Basis Reporting. In addition\nto the information reporting discussed above,\nTruist will also be\nrequired to report to the Internal Revenue\nService the cost basis for tax purposes of all\nshares acquired through the Plan on or after\nJanuary 1, 2011. Such reporting will be\nrequired at the time any such shares are sold.\n                                              \n       What provision is made for those       \n  30.  shareholders whose dividends are       \n       subject to income tax withholdings?    \n                                              \nDividends received by foreign corporations and\nnonresident aliens generally are subject to a\nUnited States withholding\ntax. The Plan Administrator will deduct the\namount of tax to be withheld at applicable\nrates (unless the participant establishes, by\nsubmitting to the Plan Administrator the\napplicable IRS Form W-8, that some\nlower percentage or no withholding is\napplicable by reason of treaty or other\nexemption for a foreign corporation or\nnonresident alien). If withholding is not\nrequired to be imposed as provided in the\nprior sentence, no withholding will apply on\ndividends received by a foreign corporation or\nnon-resident alien unless the dividend payment\nis subject to backup withholding at applicable\nrates. See Question 29F. Dividends received by\ndomestic corporations\nand U.S. citizens and residents are not\nsubject to U.S. withholding tax unless the\ndividends are subject to backup withholding.\nIn any case in which federal income taxes are\nrequired to be withheld, the Plan\nAdministrator will reinvest in Truist\ncommon stock an amount equal to the dividends\nless the amount of tax withheld.\n\n24\n\nIn addition, the Foreign Account Tax\nCompliance Act (\u0093FATCA\u0094), generally imposes a\n30%\nwithholding tax rate on U.S. source interest\nand dividends if paid to a \u0093foreign financial\ninstitution\u0094 or a \u0093non-financial foreign\nentity\u0094 (each as defined in the U.S. Internal\nRevenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094)), unless\n(i) in the case of a foreign financial\ninstitution, such institution enters into an\nagreement with the U.S. Treasury (the\n\u0093Treasury\u0094) to withhold on certain payments\nand to\ncollect and provide substantial information\nregarding U.S. account holders, including\ncertain account holders that are foreign\nentities with U.S. owners, (ii) in the case of\na non-financial foreign\nentity, such entity provides the withholding\nagent with a certification that it does not\nhave any \u0093substantial United States owners\u0094\n(as defined in the Code) or a certification\nidentifying its direct or indirect substantial\nUnited States\nowners, or (iii) the foreign financial\ninstitution or non-financial foreign entity\notherwise qualifies for an exemption from\nthese rules. While such withholding would have\napplied also to payments of\ngross proceeds from the sale or other\ndisposition of the shares on or after January\n1, 2019, recently proposed Treasury\nregulations eliminate such withholding on\npayments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers\ngenerally may rely on these\nproposed Treasury regulations until final\nTreasury regulations are issued. An applicable\nintergovernmental agreement regarding FATCA\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign jurisdiction\nmay modify the rules discussed in this\nparagraph. If U.S. federal\nwithholding tax under FATCA, or otherwise, is\nrequired on payments made to the participant,\nsuch withheld amount will be paid to the IRS.\nThat payment, if made, will be treated as a\npayment of cash to the participant with\nrespect to whom the payment\nwas made and will reduce the amount of cash to\nwhich such participant would otherwise be\nentitled. Under certain circumstances, you\nmight be eligible for refunds or credits of\nsuch taxes from the IRS. Prospective investors\nshould consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the potential application\nof FATCA to their participation in the Plan.\n\nThe foregoing is intended only as a general\ndiscussion of the current federal income tax\nconsequences of participation in the Plan as\nof the date of this prospectus. The preceding\nsummary may be rendered inaccurate by any\nfuture amendment to the federal income tax\nlaws or regulations, or any future\ninterpretations by applicable authorities. For\nspecific information as to the foreign,\nfederal, state and local tax consequences of\nparticipation in the Plan, including any\nfuture changes in applicable law or\nregulations, you should consult your own tax\nadvisers.\n\nOther Information\n                                              \n       What is the direct registration        \n  31.  system and how does it impact the      \n       Plan?                                  \n                                              \nWe are a participant in the direct\nregistration system, or DRS. DRS is a method\nof recording shares of stock in electronic, or\nbook-entry,\nform, meaning shares can be registered in your\nname on the books of Truist without the need\nfor physical certificates. Shares held in\nbook-entry under the direct registration\nsystem have all the traditional rights and\nprivileges of shares held in\ncertificated form.\n\nDRS eliminates the risk and cost of paper\ncertificates, while enabling you to maintain\nthe benefits of direct\nownership, including the ability to\nparticipate in the Plan. If you hold any\nshares in book-entry form, you may at any time\nchoose to have all or a portion of your book-\nentry shares transferred to your broker\nelectronically by contacting your\nbroker/dealer. When using your broker to\nfacilitate a share transfer, you will need to\nprovide them with a copy of your DRS account\nstatement.\n\nShares of Truist stock that are withdrawn from\nthe Plan will be issued in DRS book-entry form\nrather than physical certificates unless you\nspecify otherwise. You may convert any stock\ncertificate(s) you currently hold to\n\n25\n\nDRS book-entry form, by sending the stock\ncertificate(s) to the Plan Administrator, with\na request to deposit them to your DRS account.\nThere is no cost to you for this custodial\nservice.\n                                              \n       What happens if Truist issues a        \n  32.  dividend payable in stock or declares  \n       a stock split?                         \n                                              \nAny dividend payable in stock or shares of\ncommon stock distributed by Truist due to a\nstock split (or similar\ntransaction) on shares registered in your name\nwill be issued to you. For shares credited to\nyour account under the Plan, any such\nadditional shares will be added to your Plan\naccount.\n                                              \n       How will shares allocated to a         \n  33.  participant\u0092s account be voted at       \n       shareholders\u0092 meetings?                 \n                                              \nIf on the record date for a shareholders\nmeeting there are any shares credited to your\naccount and entitled to vote, a\nproxy will be sent to you in connection with\nthe meeting, as in the case of shareholders\nnot participating in the Plan. This proxy will\napply to all whole shares registered in your\nown name, whether acquired pursuant to the\nPlan or otherwise, as\nwell as to all shares and fractional interests\ncredited to your account under the Plan.\n\nIf your proxy is returned properly signed and\nmarked for voting, the shares covered by the\nproxy, including those registered in your name\nand those held for you by the Plan, will be\nvoted as marked. If your proxy is returned\nproperly signed but without indicating\ninstructions as to the manner\nin which shares are to be voted with respect\nto any proposal, your shares covered by the\nproxy, including those registered in your name\nand those held for you by the Plan, will be\nvoted in accordance with the recommendations\nof agents appointed by\nthe proxy. If the proxy is not properly\nexecuted and returned, your shares will be\nvoted only if you vote in person. You also may\nelect to vote in person at the meeting if you\nrevoke your proxy.\n\nNo shares held under the Plan will be voted by\nthe Plan Administrator.\n                                              \n  34.  May participants sell, pledge or       \n       otherwise assign their accounts?       \n                                              \nYour account and the shares credited to your\naccount may not be sold, pledged, assigned or\ntransferred, except that shares can be sold as\nprovided in Questions 23-25 and can be\ntransferred in accordance with such\nrequirements as may be imposed by the Plan\nAdministrator in connection with transfers.\nAny attempted pledge or assignment will be\nvoid. If you wish to sell, pledge or otherwise\nassign or transfer any shares held under the\nPlan, you must request that the certificates\nfor such shares be reissued in your name. See\nQuestion 20.\n                                              \n       Are there any special restrictions on  \n  35.  the sale or transfer of shares of      \n       Common Stock purchased under the       \n       Plan?                                  \n                                              \nInsiders of Truist are subject to Truist\u0092s\nInsider Trading Policy, which, among other\nthings, imposes\ncertain restrictions on the timing of sales of\nCommon Stock. For example, sales of Common\nStock are prohibited outside of an Open Window\nPeriod, as defined by the Insider Trading\nPolicy. Sales of Common Stock by such Insiders\nare also subject to\npreclearance requirements. Insiders are urged\nto review the applicable provisions of the\nTruist\u0092s Insider Trading Policy for complete\ndetails.\n\nParticipants who are considered \u0093affiliates\u0094\nof Truist, which include Truist directors and\ncertain senior executive officers, may\nonly sell their shares of Common Stock\nacquired under the Plan in compliance with the\nresale provisions of Rule 144 under the\nSecurities Act or as otherwise permitted under\nthe Securities Act.\n\n26\n\nFurthermore, Participants may not sell shares\nof Common Stock if they are aware of material\nnonpublic information concerning Truist or its\nsecurities.\n                                              \n       What are the responsibilities of       \n  36.  Truist and the Plan Administrator      \n       under the Plan?                        \n                                              \nTruist and the Plan Administrator will not be\nliable under the Plan for any act done in good\nfaith or for any good faith\nomission to act, including, without\nlimitation, any claims of or liability arising\nout of failure to terminate your account upon\nyour death; the prices at which, or terms upon\nwhich, shares are purchased or sold for your\naccount; the times when\npurchases or sales are made; or the\nfluctuations in the market value of Truist\u0092s\nstock before, at or after any such purchases\nor sales can be made. In no event shall Truist\nFinancial, the Plan Administrator or their\nagents have any liability as\nto any inability to purchase shares or as to\nthe timing of any purchase.\n\nAll notices from the Plan Administrator will\nbe addressed to you\nat your last address of record with the Plan\nAdministrator. The mailing of a notice to your\nlast address of record will satisfy the Plan\nAdministrator\u0092s duty of giving notice to you.\nTherefore, you must promptly notify the Plan\nAdministrator of\nany change of address. You may elect to\nreceive your Plan statement and other\ninformation via electronic delivery by signing\nup for electronic shareholder communications\nthrough Computershare Investor Center at .\n\nNeither Truist, nor the Plan Administrator\nshall have any responsibility beyond the\nexercise of ordinary care for any action taken\nor\nomitted in connection with the Plan, nor shall\nthey have any duties, responsibilities or\nliabilities except as expressly set forth\nherein.\n\nThe payment of dividends is at the discretion\nof Truist\u0092s Board of Directors (the \u0093Board\u0094)\nand will depend upon future\nearnings, Truist\u0092s financial condition and\nother factors. The Board may change the amount\nand timing of dividends at any time and\nwithout notice.\n\nYOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT NEITHER TRUIST NOR\nTHE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR CAN ASSURE YOU OF A\nPROFIT OR PROTECT YOU AGAINST A LOSS ON THE\nSHARES HELD FOR YOUR ACCOUNT UNDER THE PLAN.\n                                              \n  37.  May the Plan be changed or             \n       discontinued?                          \n                                              \nTruist reserves the right to amend, modify,\nsuspend or terminate the Plan at any time. We\nintend to provide notice of any material\namendment,\nmodification, suspension or termination to\nparticipants.

Also, Truist may elect not to\noffer or sell common stock under the Plan to\nindividuals residing in any jurisdiction or\nforeign country where, in the judgment of\nTruist, the burden or\nexpense of compliance with applicable blue sky\nor securities laws or other laws makes such\noffer or sale impracticable or inadvisable. In\nany of these circumstances, dividends, if and\nwhen declared, will be paid in the usual\nmanner to the\nshareholder and any optional cash payments\nreceived from such shareholder will be\nreturned.\n                                              \n       How may shareholders obtain answers    \n  38.  to other questions regarding the       \n       Plan?                                  \n                                              \nAny additional\nquestions about the\nPlan should be\naddressed to the Plan\nAdministrator as\nfollows:\n\nTruist Financial\nCorporation\n\nc/o Computershare\n\nDirect Stock Purchase\nand Dividend\nReinvestment Plan\n\nP.O.

In general, such\nsections provide that:\n(i) a corporation must indemnify a director or\nofficer who is wholly successful in his\ndefense of a proceeding to which he is a party\nbecause of his status as such, unless limited\nby the articles of incorporation, and (ii) a\ncorporation\nmay indemnify a director or officer if he is\nnot wholly successful in such defense if it is\ndetermined as provided by statute that the\ndirector or officer meets a certain standard\nof conduct, except that when a director or\nofficer is liable to the\ncorporation or is adjudged liable on the basis\nthat personal benefit was improperly received\nby him, the corporation may not indemnify him.\nA director or officer of a corporation who is\na party to a proceeding may also apply to a\ncourt for\nindemnification, and the court may order\nindemnification under certain circumstances\nset forth in statute. A corporation may, in\nits articles of incorporation or bylaws or by\ncontract or resolution of the board of\ndirectors, provide indemnification\nin addition to that provided by statute,\nsubject to certain conditions.\n\nTruist\u0092s bylaws provide for the\nindemnification to the\nfullest extent permitted by law of any\ndirector or officer of the registrant against\nliabilities and expenses arising out of his or\nher status or activities as such, excluding\nany liability or expenses such person may\nincur on account of his or her\nactivities which were, at the time taken,\nknown or believed by such person to be clearly\nin conflict with the best interest of Truist.\n\nTruist\u0092s articles of incorporation provide for\nthe elimination of the personal liability of\neach director of Truist to the fullest extent\npermitted by law.\n\nTruist maintains directors\u0092 and officers\u0092\nliability insurance that, in general, insures:\n(i) Truist\u0092s directors and officers against\nloss by reason of any of their wrongful acts\nand (ii) Truist against loss arising from\nclaims against the directors and officers by\nreason of their wrongful acts, all subject to\nthe terms\nand conditions contained in the policy.\nCertain rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation limit the ability of certain\ndepository institutions, their subsidiaries\nand their affiliated depository institution\nholding companies to indemnify\naffiliated parties, including institution\ndirectors. In general, subject to the ability\nto purchase directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability\ninsurance and to advance professional expenses\nunder certain circumstances, the rules\nprohibit such\ninstitutions from indemnifying a director for\ncertain costs incurred with regard to an\nadministrative\n\nII-1\n\nor enforcement action commenced by any federal\nbanking agency that results in a final order\nor settlement pursuant to which the director\nis assessed a civil money penalty, removed\nfrom office,\nprohibited from participating in the affairs\nof an insured depository institution or\nrequired to cease and desist from or take an\naffirmative action described in Section\n8(b)(ii) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n(12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(b)).\n                       \n  Item\u00a016.

Provided, however,\nthat no statement made in a registration\nstatement or prospectus that is part of the\nregistration\nstatement or made in a document incorporated\nor deemed incorporated by reference into the\nregistration statement or prospectus that is\npart of the registration statement will, as to\na purchaser with a time of contract of sale\nprior to such effective\ndate, supersede or modify any statement that\nwas made in the registration statement or\nprospectus that was part of the registration\nstatement or made in any such document\nimmediately prior to such effective date.\n\n(5) That, for the purpose of determining\nliability of the registrant under the\nSecurities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the\ninitial\ndistribution of the securities, the\nundersigned registrant undertakes that in a\nprimary offering of the registrant\u0092s\nsecurities pursuant to this registration\nstatement, regardless of the underwriting\nmethod used to sell the securities to the\npurchaser, if the securities are offered or\nsold to such purchaser by means of any of the\nfollowing communications, the undersigned\nregistrant will be a seller to the purchaser\nand will be considered to offer or sell such\nsecurities to such\npurchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus\nof such undersigned registrant relating to the\noffering\nrequired to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to\nthe offering prepared by or\non behalf of such undersigned registrant or\nused or referred to by such undersigned\nregistrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of\nany other free writing prospectus relating to\nthe offering containing material information\nabout such undersigned registrant or its\nsecurities provided by or on behalf of such\nundersigned registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer\nin the offering made by such undersigned\nregistrant to the purchaser.\n\n(6) That, for purposes of determining any\nliability under the Securities Act of 1933,\neach filing of the registrant\u0092s annual report\npursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and,\nwhere applicable, each filing of an employee\nbenefit plan\u0092s annual report pursuant to\nSection 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934)\nthat is incorporated by reference in the\nregistration statement shall be deemed to be a\nnew registration statement relating to the\nsecurities offered therein, and the offering\nof such securities at that time shall be\ndeemed to be the initial bona\nfide offering thereof.\n\nII-3\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities\narising under the Securities Act of 1933 may\nbe\npermitted to directors, officers and\ncontrolling persons of the registrant pursuant\nto the provisions described in Item 15 above,\nor otherwise, the registrant has been advised\nthat in the opinion of the SEC such\nindemnification is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Act and is,\ntherefore, unenforceable.
