definitive agreement to sell its\nremaining equity interests in its insurance\nbrokerage subsidiary, Truist Insurance\nHoldings, LLC (\u201cTIH\u201d), to an investor group\nled by Stone Point Capital LLC, Clayton,\nDubilier & Rice, LLC and Mubadala Investment\nCompany (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). The parties\nexpect to complete the Transaction during the\nsecond quarter of 2024, subject to certain\nregulatory reviews and approvals and the\nsatisfaction of other customary closing\nconditions.\n\nThe Transaction represents a strategic shift\nmaterially impacting Truist's financial\nstatements, and as a result, Truist is making\ncertain financial reporting changes and\nreclassifications in the presentation of its\nfinancial statements to reflect the financial\nposition and results of operations of TIH as\ndiscontinued operations. In advance of the\npublication of its unaudited financial\nstatements for the first quarter of 2024 that\nwill reflect the financial position and\nresults of operations of TIH as discontinued\noperations, Truist is providing certain\nunaudited supplemental quarterly historical\nfinancial information for 2023 presented in a\nmanner that conforms to the new financial\nstatement presentation. The unaudited\nsupplemental financial information is\nfurnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by\nreference herein.\n\nThe unaudited supplemental historical\nfinancial information does not revise or\nrestate the previously reported consolidated\nfinancial statements of Truist for any period.\nHowever, following the publication of its Form\n10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31,\n2024, Truist expects to publish a Current\nReport on Form 8-K that recasts its\nconsolidated financial statements for the year\nended and as of December 31, 2023 to reflect\nTIH as discontinued operations for the\nhistorical periods presented in such financial\nstatements.\nThe information provided pursuant to this Item\n7.01, including the attached exhibit, is being\nfurnished and shall not be deemed to be\n\"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nor otherwise subject to the liabilities of\nthat Section, nor shall it be deemed\nincorporated by reference into Truist\u2019s other\nfilings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, except as otherwise expressly\nstated in such filing. All information in this\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K and in the exhibit\nhereto speaks as of the date hereof and\nthereof, respectively, and Truist does not\nassume any obligation to update such\ninformation in the future. In addition, Truist\ndisclaims any inference regarding the\nmateriality of information in this Current\nReport on Form 8-K which otherwise may arise\nas a result of Truist furnishing such\ninformation under Item 7.01 of this Current\nReport on Form 8-K.\n                                              \n  ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and          \n  Exhibits                                    \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits\n                                              \n  Exhibit No.    Description of Exhibit       \n                 Unaudited Supplemental       \n  99.1           Historical Financial         \n                 Information                  \n                 The cover page from this     \n  104            Current Report on Form 8-K,  \n                 formatted in Inline XBRL.    \n                                              \n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n  TRUIST FINANCIAL                            \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                           -Registrant        \n                    By:    /s/ Cynthia B.     \n                           Powell             \n                           Cynthia B.
