\u2610\nITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain\nOfficers; Election of Directors; Appointment\nof Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements\nof Certain Officers\n\nOn December 18, 2023, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee of the Board of\nDirectors of Truist Financial Corporation\n(\u201cTruist\u201d) approved the Amended and Restated\nManagement Change of Control, Severance, and\nNoncompetition Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The purpose\nof the Plan, originally approved by the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee on\nJuly 25, 2022, is to establish and maintain a\nvital management team essential to protecting\nand enhancing the best interests of Truist and\nits shareholders, to protect members of the\nOperating Council and certain other senior\nleaders of Truist (each such person, a\n\u201cParticipant\u201d), including our named executive\nofficers, in the case of non-Change of Control\n(as defined in the Truist Financial\nCorporation 2022 Incentive Plan) employment\nchanges, and to secure the continued\ndedication and objectivity of Truist\u2019s\nmanagement team in the event of any threat or\noccurrence of, or negotiation or other action\nthat could lead to or create the possibility\nof, a Change of Control, without concern as to\nwhether members of the management team might\nbe hindered or distracted by personal\nuncertainties and risks created by any such\npossible Change of Control, and to encourage\ntheir full attention and dedication.\n\nUnder the Plan, a Participant who undergoes a\nqualifying termination other than for cause\n(as defined in the Plan) or for good reason\n(as defined in the Plan), including in the\ncase of such a termination of employment that\noccurs within 24 months after a Change of\nControl, will receive, subject to the\nParticipant\u2019s execution of a general release\nof claims:\n\na. A lump sum payment equal to two times the\nsum of (a) the Participant\u2019s annual base\nsalary (annualized), as most recently\nincreased, plus (b) the annual cash bonus the\nParticipant would have received for the year\nof termination assuming target performance,\noffset by the extent to which the Participant\nreceives base salary or annual cash bonus\nduring the garden leave period described\nbelow.\n\na. To the extent the Participant has been\nparticipating in the medical, dental and/or\nvision plan of Truist or an affiliate as of\nthe date of termination, Truist will pay to\nthe Participant a lump sum payment in cash\nequal to the product of (a) 24 multiplied by\n(b) the monthly COBRA premium as of the date\nof termination for the medical, dental and\nvision coverage Participant had immediately\nprior to the date of termination minus the\nmonthly dollar amount the Participant would\nhave paid to Truist for such coverage, offset\nby the extent to which the Participant\nparticipates in such benefit plans during the\ngarden leave period described below.\n\nFor Section 16 officers, the Plan also\nincludes a non-competition obligation for 12\nmonths after the date of the Participant\u2019s\ntermination of employment. All Participants\nare additionally obligated not to solicit\nTruist teammates or clients for 12 months\nafter the date of the Participant\u2019s\ntermination of employment. As amended, the\nPlan additionally provides for a three-month\ngarden leave period for Participants who\nresign with or without good reason. The\nParticipant must provide Truist with three\nmonths\u2019 advance written notice of his or her\ntermination of employment, and during the\nthree-month garden leave period, he or she\nwill remain employed at Truist.\n\nThis summary is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the copy of the Plan, which is\nexpected to be filed as an exhibit to our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee also approved an\nincrease in the total compensation of Mr.\nDont\u00e1 Wilson, who was promoted in November to\nthe position of Chief Consumer and Small\nBusiness Banking Officer. Mr. Wilson\u2019s base\nsalary will increase to $750,000 per year. Mr.\nWilson\u2019s target annual cash incentive\ncompensation opportunity under Truist\u2019s Annual\nIncentive Performance award program will\nincrease to 215% of base salary. Mr. Wilson\u2019s\ntarget long-term incentive compensation\nopportunity will increase to 485% of base\nsalary (195% performance share units, 121%\ncash long-term incentive plan awards and 169%\nrestricted stock units). In total, Mr.\nWilson\u2019s annual target compensation will\nincrease to $6,000,000. This compensation\nincrease will be effective as of January 1,\n2024.\n                                              \n  ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and          \n  Exhibits.                                   \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits\n                                              \n  Exhibit No.    Description of Exhibit       \n                 The cover page from this     \n  104            Current Report on Form 8-K,  \n                 formatted in Inline XBRL.    \n                                              \n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly\ncaused this report to be signed on its behalf\nby the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n  TRUIST FINANCIAL                            \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                           -Registrant        \n                    By:    /s/ Cynthia B.     \n                           Powell             \n                           Cynthia B.
