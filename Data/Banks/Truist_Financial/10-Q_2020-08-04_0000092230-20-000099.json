                            \n  NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q\nand, therefore, do not include all information\nand notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited financial\nstatements but does not include all\ndisclosures required by GAAP. The information\ncontained in the financial statements and\nnotes included in the Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019\nshould be referred to in connection with these\nunaudited interim consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company updated its accounting\npolicies in connection with recently adopted\naccounting standards. There were no other\nsignificant changes to the Company\u2019s\naccounting policies from those disclosed in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2019 that could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods'\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nfinancial instruments; valuation of MSRs;\ngoodwill, intangible assets and other purchase\naccounting related adjustments; benefit plan\nobligations and expenses; and tax assets,\nliabilities and expense.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance over an\nentire interest rate cycle. Investments in\ndebt securities that are not held for trading\npurposes are classified as HTM or AFS. Truist\ndoes not currently have any securities\nclassified as HTM.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nDebt securities that may be sold to meet\nliquidity needs arising from unanticipated\ndeposit and loan fluctuations, changes in\nregulatory capital requirements or unforeseen\nchanges in market conditions are classified as\nAFS. AFS securities are reported at estimated\nfair value, with unrealized gains and losses\nreported in AOCI, net of deferred income\ntaxes, in the Shareholders' equity section of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or\nlosses realized from the sale of AFS\nsecurities are determined by specific\nidentification and are included in noninterest\nincome.\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit losses are measured on an\nindividual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the US\ngovernment, are highly rated by rating\nagencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. There was no ACL on the Company\u2019s AFS\ndebt securities at June 30, 2020.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company's accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased, and if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that at the date of acquisition there is\nmore than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nOriginated Loans and Leases\n\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture or until maturity or payoff are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest method.\n\nPurchased Loans\n\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date. The estimated\nfair values incorporate adjustments related to\nexpected credit losses, prevailing market\ninterest rates for comparable assets and\nliquidity-related adjustments.\n\nFair values for purchased loans are based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology that\nconsiders credit loss expectations, market\ninterest rates and other market factors such\nas liquidity from the perspective of a market\nparticipant. Loans are grouped together\naccording to similar characteristics and\ntreated in the aggregate when applying various\nvaluation techniques. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninternal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2020, purchased loans are\nevaluated upon acquisition and classified as\neither PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality, including but not limited to risk\ngrades, delinquency, nonperforming status,\nprevious troubled debt restructurings or\nbankruptcies and other qualitative factors\nthat indicate deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination.\n\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans, and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans, is amortized or accreted to interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\ninterest-only loans and loans with revolving\nprivileges. In the event of prepayment,\nunamortized discounts or premiums are\nrecognized in interest and fees on loans and\nleases.\n\nTDRs\n\nModifications to a borrower's debt agreement\nare considered TDRs if a concession is granted\nfor economic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower's financial difficulties that\notherwise would not be considered. TDRs are\nundertaken to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan and may take the form of\nmodifications made with the stated interest\nrate lower than the current market rate for\nnew debt with similar risk, other\nmodifications to the structure of the loan\nthat fall outside of normal underwriting\npolicies and procedures, or in certain limited\ncircumstances, forgiveness of principal or\ninterest. A restructuring that results in only\na delay in payments that is insignificant is\nnot considered an economic concession. In\naccordance with the CARES Act, Truist\nimplemented loan modification programs in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to\nprovide borrowers with flexibility with\nrespect to repayment terms. Truist payment\nrelief assistance includes forbearance,\ndeferrals, extension and re-aging programs,\nalong with certain other modification\nstrategies. The Company elected the accounting\npolicy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR\naccounting to loans modified for borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\napplies this policy to loans modified in\nresponse to a COVID-19 hardship that were less\nthan 30 days past due at December 31, 2019, or\nin certain circumstances, at the time that the\nCOVID-19 loan modification program was\nimplemented, unless the loan was previously\nclassified as a TDR.\n\nTDRs can be classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower will be\nable to repay the loan based on the modified\nterms. In circumstances where the TDR involves\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classifies these TDRs as nonperforming.\n\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe decision to maintain a commercial TDR on\nperforming status is based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrower's\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation includes consideration of the\nborrower's current capacity to pay, which\namong other things may include a review of the\nborrower's current financial statements, an\nanalysis of cash flow available to pay debt\nobligations, and an evaluation of secondary\nsources of payment from the borrower and any\nguarantors. This evaluation also includes an\nevaluation of the borrower's current\nwillingness to pay, which may include a review\nof past payment history, an evaluation of the\nborrower's willingness to provide information\non a timely basis, and consideration of offers\nfrom the borrower to provide additional\ncollateral or guarantor support. The credit\nevaluation may also include review of cash\nflow projections, consideration of the\nadequacy of collateral to cover all principal\nand interest and trends indicating improving\nprofitability and collectability of\nreceivables.\n\nThe evaluation of mortgage and retail loans\nincludes an evaluation of the client's debt-\nto-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue, loan vintage, and certain other client-\nspecific factors that impact the clients\u2019\nability to make timely principal and interest\npayments on the loan.\n\nTDR classification may be removed due to the\npassage of time if the loan: (1) did not\ninclude a forgiveness of principal or\ninterest, (2) has performed in accordance with\nthe modified terms (generally a minimum of six\nmonths), (3) was reported as a TDR over a\nyear-end reporting period, and (4) reflected\nan interest rate on the modified loan that was\nno less than a market rate at the date of\nmodification. TDR classification may also be\nremoved for an accruing loan upon the\noccurrence of a subsequent non-concessionary\nmodification granted at market terms and\nwithin current underwriting guidelines.\nNPAs\nNPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property.\nForeclosed property consists of real estate\nand other assets acquired as a result of\nclients' loan defaults.\nTruist's policies for placing loans on\nnonperforming status conform to guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities.\nTruist classifies loans and leases as past due\nwhen the payment of principal and interest\nbased upon contractual terms is greater than\n30 days delinquent or if one payment is past\ndue. Payment deferrals granted as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic do not result in a loan\nbecoming past due.

Consumer and credit card\nloans are subject to charge-off at a specified\ndelinquency date consistent with regulatory\nguidelines.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\n\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus. Reserves are established for accrued\ninterest related to loans that have been\ndeferred in connection with the CARES Act\nbased on management\u2019s best estimate of the\ninterest that may ultimately prove to be\nuncollectible.\n\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value less\nestimated cost to sell and subsequently\ncarried at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value equals fair value\nless estimated selling costs. Any excess of\ncost over net realizable value at the time of\nforeclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are\nsubject to periodic revaluations of the\ncollateral underlying impaired loans and\nforeclosed real estate. The periodic\nrevaluations are generally based on the\nappraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist's\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than six months\nold, otherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition on these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \"Note 5. Loans and\nACL.\u201d\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from or added to the loans\u2019 amortized\ncost basis to present the net amount expected\nto be collected on loans. The entire amount of\nthe ACL is available to absorb losses on any\nloan category or lending-related commitment.\nLoan or lease balances deemed to be\nuncollectible are charged off against the\nALLL. Expected recoveries of amounts\npreviously charged off are incorporated into\nthe ALLL estimate, with such amounts capped at\nthe aggregate of amounts previously charged\noff. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to\nthe Provision for credit losses, which is\nreflected in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The RUFC is recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments; commercial, consumer\nand credit card. The expected credit loss\nmodels are generally developed one level below\nthe portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans are further disaggregated by\nsimilar risk characteristics, such as business\nsector, client type, funding type, type of\ncollateral, whether loan payments are\ninterest-only and whether interest rates are\nfixed or variable. Larger loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nor that are considered collateral-dependent\nare individually evaluated. For these loans,\nthe ALLL is determined through review of data\nspecific to the borrower and related\ncollateral, if any. Such estimates may be\nbased on current loss forecasts, an evaluation\nof the fair value of the underlying collateral\nor in certain circumstances the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest as described further\nbelow by portfolio segment. The commercial\nportfolio segment models use a risk rating\napproach to estimate the ALLL. The consumer\nand credit card models use a delinquency-based\napproach to estimate the ALLL. In addition to\nthese quantitatively calculated components,\nthe ALLL includes qualitatively calculated\ncomponents.\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic scenarios, portfolio\ncomposition and loan attributes as the primary\ninputs. Loss estimates are informed by\nhistorical loss experience adjusted for\nmacroeconomic forecasts and current and\nexpected portfolio risk characteristics.\nExpected losses are estimated through\ncontractual maturity unless the borrower has a\nright to renew that is not cancellable or it\nis reasonably expected that the loan will be\nmodified as a TDR.\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for enterprise-\nsanctioned macroeconomic scenarios, including\nthe macroeconomic forecasts for use in the ACL\nprocess. Forecasted economic conditions are\ndeveloped using third party macroeconomic\nscenarios adjusted based on management\u2019s\nexpectations over a reasonable and supportable\nforecast period of two years. Assumptions\nrevert to long term historic averages\ngradually over a one year period.\nMacroeconomic factors used in estimating the\nexpected losses vary by loan portfolio and\ninclude employment factors, estimated\ncollateral values and market indicators as\ndescribed by portfolio segment below. A\nqualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to capture risks in the\nportfolio such as considerations with respect\nto the impact of current economic events, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain. These events\nmay include, but are not limited to, political\nconditions, legislation that may directly or\nindirectly affect the banking industry and\neconomic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which\nTruist conducts business.\n\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\n\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\n\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower's ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers' financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower's ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan's guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is not in\nquestion. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management's   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting models are\nexpected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic scenarios and current portfolio\nattributes as inputs. The models forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the commercial\nportfolios include unemployment, U.S. real\nGDP, corporate credit spreads, rental rates\nand property values.\n\nTruist's policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all nonperforming\nlending relationships and TDRs with an\noutstanding balance of $5 million or more, as\nsuch lending relationships do not typically\nshare similar risk characteristics with\nothers. Individually evaluated reserves are\nbased on current forecasts, the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest rate or the value of\ncollateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories and other types of collateral.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 13\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe majority of the ALLL related to the\nconsumer and credit card lending portfolios is\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness and sales channel. Consumer portfolio\nmodels are expected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic scenarios and current portfolio\nattributes as inputs. The models forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the consumer\nportfolios include unemployment trends, home\nprice indices and used car prices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination, and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and\nindirect other portfolios include secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used automobiles,\nboats and recreational vehicles. The student\nloan portfolio is composed of securitized\ngovernment-guaranteed student loans and\ncertain private student loans originated by\nthird parties. The government guarantee\nmitigates substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. Private\nstudent loans purchased from third-party\noriginators with credit enhancements partially\nmitigate the Company\u2019s credit exposure. The\ncredit card portfolio and other arrangements\nwithin the indirect other portfolio are\ngenerally unsecured and actively managed.\n\nTruist uses performing status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n\nThe ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is\nbased on analyses capturing the expected\ncredit losses and the impact of the concession\nover the remaining life of the asset.\n\nExpected recoveries for consumer and credit\ncard loans are included in the estimation of\nthe ALLL based on historical experience.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Pronouncements\n                                              \n                                 Effects on   \n                                 the          \n                                 Financial    \n                                 Statements   \n                                 Truist       \n                                 adopted      \n                                 this         \n                                 standard     \n                                 using the    \n                                 modified     \n                                 retrospect\u2026  \n                                 approach.    \n                                 The          \n                                 adoption of  \n                                 this         \n                                 standard     \n                                 resulted in  \n                                 a $3.1       \n                                 billion      \n                                 increase to  \n                                 the ALLL     \n                                 and a $2.1   \n                                 billion      \n                                 decrease to  \n                                 Retained     \n                                 earnings     \n                                 adjusted     \n                                 for          \n                                 deferred     \n                                 taxes and    \n                                 other        \n                 Description     impacts.     \n                 Replaces the    A policy     \n                 incurred        election     \n                 loss            was made to  \n                 impairment      dissolve     \n                 methodology     the          \n                 with an         existing     \n                 expected        PCI loan     \n                 credit loss     pools.

The Merger\nwas accounted for as a business combination.\nAccordingly, the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were recorded at their\nfair values as of the Merger date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nacquired assets and liabilities are subject to\nadjustment until all necessary information\nrelated to the valuation process has been\nreceived.

ALLL for PCD acquisitions and other\nactivity.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe adoption of CECL increased the ALLL $\n3.1billion. The following discussion of the\nchanges in the factors that influenced\nTruist\u2019s ACL estimate and the reasons for\nthose changes excludes the impact at adoption\nand certain other activity.\n\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 442million and\n$ 853million for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2020, respectively. The\nincreases are primarily attributed to a more\npessimistic outlook with respect to future\neconomic conditions driven by the COVID-19\npandemic and specific consideration of the\nrisks associated with exposures to certain\nindustries, including oil and gas,\nhospitality, and lending to small businesses.\nExcluding guaranteed PPP loans, loan growth,\nprimarily driven by draws on existing credit\nfacilities, was also a contributor to the\nincrease in the allowance for the six months\nended June 30, 2020.\n\nThe consumer ALLL increased $ 69million and $\n199million for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2020, respectively. These increases\nreflect the impact of the more pessimistic\noutlook described above, with the largest\nquarterly and year-to-date increases seen in\nthe unsecured portfolios and the nonprime auto\nlending portfolio.\n\nThe ALLL for credit card decreased $ 20million\nand increased $ 30million for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.\nThe decrease for the quarter reflects lower\nloan balances; the year-to-date increase\nreflects risks associated with COVID-19 and a\nmore pessimistic economic outlook.\n\nThe RUFC increased $ 31million and $ 22million\nfor the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020, respectively. The net increase reflects\nthe more pessimistic outlook with respect to\nfuture economic conditions driven by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic partially offset by lower\nlevels of unfunded commitments that resulted\nfrom first quarter draws on existing credit\nfacilities and the sale of certain unfunded\ncommitments.\n\nTruist\u2019s ACL estimate represents management\u2019s\nbest estimate of expected credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolio,\nincluding unfunded commitments, at the balance\nsheet date. This estimate incorporates both\nquantitatively-derived output, as well as\nqualitative components that represent expected\nlosses not otherwise captured by the models.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, which management has determined to be\ntwo years, followed by a reversion to long-\nterm historical loss conditions over a one-\nyear period. These macro-economic forecasts\ninclude a number of key economic variables\nutilized in loss forecasting that include, but\nare not limited to, the US unemployment rate,\nUS unemployment claims rate, US real GDP, Home\nPrice Index, US Central Bank Policy Interest\nRate and the Manheim Index.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement considered multiple macro-economic\nforecasts that reflected a range of possible\noutcomes in order to capture the changing\nseverity of the pandemic and the associated\neconomic disruption. The economic forecast\nshaping the ACL estimate at June 30, 2020\nincluded an extended GDP recovery through the\ntwo-year reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod and an initial double-digit\nunemployment followed by a continued sustained\nhigh single-digit level of unemployment.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses in\ntimes of rapidly changing macro-economic\nforecasts. As a result, management believes\nthat the qualitative component of the ACL,\nwhich incorporates management\u2019s expert\njudgment related to expected future credit\nlosses, will continue to represent a\nsignificant portion of the ACL for the\nforeseeable future. The June 30, 2020 ACL\nestimate includes qualitative adjustments to\nadjust for limitations in modeled results with\nrespect to forecasted economic conditions that\nare well outside of historic economic\nconditions used to develop the models and to\ngive consideration to significant government\nrelief programs, stimulus and client\naccommodations.\nPCD Loan Activity\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is recognized in the\nALLL on the date of acquisition using the same\nmethodology as other loans held for\ninvestment.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

Fair Value Disclosures\" for additional\ninformation on the valuation techniques used.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Activities\nThe following table summarizes commercial\nmortgage servicing activities for the periods\npresented:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2020            2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  UPB of                                      \n  CRE                                         \n  mortgages    $      72,522    $     70,404  \n  serviced                                    \n  for                                         \n  others                                      \n  CRE                                         \n  mortgages                                   \n  serviced                                    \n  for                                         \n  others               8,641           8,676  \n  covered                                     \n  by                                          \n  recourse                                    \n  provisio\u2026                                   \n  Maximum                                     \n  recourse                                    \n  exposure                                    \n  from CRE             2,490           2,479  \n  mortgages                                   \n  sold with                                   \n  recourse                                    \n  liability                                   \n  Recorded                                    \n  reserves                                    \n  related                 19              13  \n  to                                          \n  recourse                                    \n  exposure                                    \n  CRE                                         \n  mortgages                                   \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  during               3,332           8,062  \n  the                                         \n  year-to-\u2026                                   \n  period                                      \n  Commerci\u2026                                   \n  MSRs at                224             247  \n  fair                                        \n  value                                       \n                                              \n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 8.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets. The TRS\ncontracts pass through interest and other cash\nflows on the reference assets to the third\nparty clients, along with exposing those\nclients to decreases in value on the assets\nand providing them with the rights to\nappreciation on the assets. The terms of the\nTRS contracts require the third parties to\npost initial margin collateral, as well as\nongoing margin as the fair values of the\nunderlying reference assets change.\n\nThe Company concluded that the VIEs should be\nconsolidated because the Company has (i) the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses, and the right to receive benefits,\nthat could potentially be significant. At June\n30, 2020, the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet reflected $ 1.6billion of assets and $\n95million of other liabilities of the VIEs. At\nDecember 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet reflected $ 2.7billion of assets\nand $ 116million of other liabilities of the\nVIEs. Assets at June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 include $ 1.5billion and $ 2.6billion in\ntrading loans, respectively. The activities of\nthe VIEs are restricted to buying and selling\nthe reference assets and the risks/benefits of\nany such assets owned by the VIEs are passed\nto the third party clients via the TRS\ncontracts.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nTRS contracts and its involvement with these\nVIEs, see \"Note 16. Derivative Financial\nInstruments.\u201d\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law. Assets pledged\nto the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable\nasset discounts when determining borrowing\ncapacity. The Company obtains secured\nfinancing and letters of credit from the FRB\nand FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of credit from\nthe FHLB can be used to secure various client\ndeposits, including public fund relationships.\nExcluding assets related to employee benefit\nplans, the majority of the agreements\ngoverning the pledged assets do not permit the\nother party to sell or repledge the\ncollateral. Additional assets were pledged to\nthe FRB of Richmond in the first quarter of\n2020 following the Merger.

The matters range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with multiple class members\nand can involve claims for substantial\namounts. Investigations involve both formal\nand informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThese legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration or investigation\nand may consist of a variety of claims,\nincluding common law tort and contract claims\nand statutory antitrust, securities and\nconsumer protection claims, and the ultimate\nresolution of any proceedings is uncertain and\ninherently difficult to predict. It is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters, if unfavorable, may be material to\nthe consolidated financial position,\nconsolidated results of operations, or\nconsolidated cash flows of Truist.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP\nfor contingencies, Truist establishes accruals\nfor legal matters when potential losses\nassociated with the actions become probable\nand the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. There is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the amounts that Truist\nhas currently accrued. On a quarterly basis,\nTruist evaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings to assess litigation accruals and\nadjust such accruals upwards or downward, as\nappropriate, based on management\u2019s best\njudgment after consultation with counsel and\nothers, as warranted.\n\nThe Company\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, ranges\nfrom zeroto approximately $ 200million as of\nJune 30, 2020. This estimated range is based\nupon currently available information and\ninvolves considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors. In\naddition, the matters underlying this\nestimated range will change from time to time,\nand actual losses may vary significantly from\nthis estimate. For the same reasons stated\nabove, we do not believe that an estimate of\nreasonably possible losses can be made for\ncertain matters and therefore such matters are\nnot reflected in the range provided here.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived. On October 6, 2017, the trial court\ngranted plaintiff's motion for class\ncertification and defined the class as \u201cEvery\nGeorgia citizen who had or has one or more\naccounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July\n12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least\none overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting\nfrom an ATM or debit card transaction (the\n\u201cTransaction\u201d); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees\nas a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did\nnot receive a refund of those Fees\u201d and the\ngranting of a certified class was affirmed on\nappeal. On April 8, 2020, the Company filed a\nmotion seeking to narrow the scope of this\nclass and on May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed\nmotion to compel arbitration of the claims of\nsome of the class members. Discovery has\ncommenced. The Company believes that the\nclaims are without merit.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Following the\ndeconsolidation, the investments in SBIC funds\nare valued based on net asset value per unit,\nas provided by the fund manager as a practical\nexpedient, which approximates the fair value,\nand have not been classified in the fair value\nhierarchy. The SBIC funds in which the Company\ninvests primarily focus on equity and\nsubordinated debt investments in privately-\nheld middle market companies. The majority of\nthese VIE investments are not redeemable and\ndistributions are received as the underlying\nassets of the funds liquidate. The timing of\ndistributions, which are expected to occur on\nvarious dates on an approximately ratable\nbasis through 2030, is uncertain and dependent\non various events such as recapitalizations,\nrefinance transactions and ownership changes\namong others. As of June 30, 2020,\nrestrictions on the ability to sell the\ninvestments include, but are not limited to,\nconsent of a majority member or general\npartner approval for transfer of ownership.\nThese investments are spread over numerous\nprivately-held middle market companies, and\nthus the sensitivity to a change in fair value\nfor any single investment is limited. At June\n30, 2020, investments totaling $ 276million\nhave been excluded from the table above as\nvalued based on net asset value as a practical\nexpedient.\n\nFor a description of the valuation techniques\nand significant inputs for Level 2 and Level 3\nassets and liabilities that are measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis, see \u201cNote 18.\nFair Value Disclosures\u201d of the Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2019.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 37\nActivity for Level 3 assets and liabilities is\nsummarized below:\n                                              \n                                          P\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026       E\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       M\u2026       \u2026       I\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  7    $  3\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        1  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       61  \n         \u2014       \u2014       30       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       -1  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2026        \u2014  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  9\u2026    $  7    $  4\u2026  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014       1\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $   \u2014  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $   \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2026                \u2026       P\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       M\u2026       \u2026       E\u2026  \n                                          I\u2026  \n      $  3    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       24  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       68  \n         \u2014       \u2014       52       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -2  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2026        \u2014  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  9\u2026    $  7    $  4\u2026  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        2  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       27  \n         \u2014       \u2014       3\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014        \u2014  \n         \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $   \u2014  \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $   \u2014  \n                         R\u2026       \u2026           \n                         m\u2026       \u2026           \n                 \u2026       i\u2026       \u2026           \n         \u2026       \u2026       a\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       i\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       r\u2026       \u2026           \n                 \u2026       e\u2026       \u2026           \n                         r\u2026       \u2026           \n                         i\u2026       \u2026           \n                                              \nIn the second quarter of 2020, Truist sold\nnon-agency MBS previously categorized as Level\n3 that represented ownership interests in\nvarious tranches of Re-REMIC trusts.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions, currency and interest\nrate risk characteristics, loss experience and\nother factors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

part of the Company\u2019s corporate investment\nbanking business, the Company enters into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, credit\ndefault swaps, risk participations and TRS.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nThe Company has entered into TRS contracts on\nloans. The Company\u2019s TRS business consists of\nmatched trades, such that when the Company\npays depreciation on one TRS, it receives the\nsame amount on the matched TRS. To mitigate\nits credit risk, the Company typically\nreceives initial margin from the counterparty\nupon entering into the TRS and variation\nmargin if the fair value of the underlying\nreference assets deteriorates.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe dealer experiences a loss on the\nderivative, such as an interest rate swap, due\nto a failure to pay by the client, on that\nderivative. The Company manages its payment\nrisk on its risk participations by monitoring\nthe creditworthiness of the underlying client\nthrough the normal credit review process that\nthe Company would have performed had it\nentered into a derivative directly with the\nobligors. At June 30, 2020, the remaining\nterms on these risk participations ranged from\nless than one year to 10 years. The potential\nfuture exposure represents the Company\u2019s\nmaximum estimated exposure to written risk\nparticipations, as measured by projecting a\nmaximum value of the guaranteed derivative\ninstruments based on scenario simulations and\nassuming 100% default by all obligors on the\nmaximum value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

The descriptions below summarize\ncertain significant government actions taken\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The\ndescriptions are qualified in their entirety\nby reference to the particular statutory or\nregulatory provisions or government programs\nsummarized.\n                                              \n  The CARES Act                               \n                                              \nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27,\n2020 and subsequently has been amended several\ntimes. Among other provisions the CARES Act\nincludes funding for the Small Business\nAdministration to expand lending, relief from\ncertain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow\nCOVID-19-related loan modifications to not be\ncategorized as troubled debt restructurings\nand a range of incentives to encourage\ndeferment, forbearance or modification of\nloans. One of the key CARES Act programs is\nthe PPP, which temporarily expands the Small\nBusiness Administration\u2019s business loan\nguarantee program through August 8, 2020. PPP\nloans are available to a broader range of\nentities than ordinary Small Business\nAdministration loans, require deferral of\nprincipal and interest repayment, and the loan\nmay be forgiven in an amount equal to payroll\ncosts and certain other expenses during either\nan eight-week or 24-week covered period.\n\nThe CARES Act contains additional protections\nfor homeowners and renters of properties with\nfederally backed mortgages, including a 60-day\nmoratorium on the initiation of foreclosure\nproceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a\n120-day moratorium on initiating eviction\nproceedings effective March 27, 2020.\nBorrowers of federally backed mortgages have\nthe right under the CARES Act to request up to\n360 days of forbearance on their mortgage\npayments if they experience financial hardship\ndirectly or indirectly due to the coronavirus-\nrelated public health emergency. FNMA, FHLMC,\nFHA and VA have extended their moratorium on\nforeclosures and evictions for single-family\nfederally backed mortgages until at least\nAugust 31, 2020.\n\nAlso pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S.\nTreasury has the authority to provide loans,\nguarantees and other investments in support of\neligible businesses, states and municipalities\naffected by the economic effects of COVID-19.\nSome of these funds have been used to support\nthe several FRB programs and facilities\ndescribed below or additional programs or\nfacilities that are established by the FRB\nunder its Section 13(3) authority and meeting\ncertain criteria.\n                                              \n  FRB Actions                                 \n                                              \nThe FRB has taken a range of actions to\nsupport the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses. For example, on March 15, 2020,\nthe FRB reduced the target range for the\nfederal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced\nthat it would increase its holdings of U.S.\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and begin purchasing agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB\nhas also encouraged depository institutions to\nborrow from the discount window and has\nlowered the primary credit rate for such\nborrowing by 150 basis points while extending\nthe term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve\nrequirements have been reduced to zero as of\nMarch 26, 2020.\n\nIn addition, the FRB has established, or has\ntaken steps to establish, a range of\nfacilities and programs to support the U.S.\neconomy and U.S. marketplace participants in\nresponse to economic disruptions associated\nwith COVID-19. Through these facilities and\nprograms, the FRB, relying on its authority\nunder Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve\nAct, has taken steps to directly or indirectly\npurchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S.\ncompanies, financial institutions,\nmunicipalities and other market participants.\n\nFRB facilities and programs established, or in\nthe process of being established, include:\n\n\u2022 a PPP Liquidity Facility to provide\nfinancing related to PPP loans made by banks;\n\n\u2022 three Main Street Loan Facilities to\npurchase loan participations, under specified\nconditions, from banks lending to small and\nmedium sized U.S. businesses;\n\n\u2022 a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide\nliquidity to primary dealers through a secured\nlending facility;\n\n\u2022 a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to\npurchase the commercial paper of certain U.S.\nissuers;\n\n46 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility\nto purchase corporate bonds directly from, or\nmake loans directly to, eligible participants;\n\n\u2022 a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility\nto purchase corporate bonds trading in\nsecondary markets, including from exchange-\ntraded funds, that were issued by eligible\nparticipants;\n\n\u2022 a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility\nto make loans secured by asset-backed\nsecurities;\n\n\u2022 a Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase\nbonds directly from U.S. state, city and\ncounty issuers; and\n\n\u2022 a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility to purchase certain assets from, or\nmake loans to, financial institutions\nproviding financing to eligible money market\nmutual funds.\n\nThese facilities and programs are in various\nstages of development, and the Company and\nTruist Bank may participate in some or all of\nthem, including as an agent or intermediary on\nbehalf of clients or customers or in an\nadvisory capacity.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Considerations                   \n                                              \nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and the stability of\nthe financial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and creditors.\nTruist is subject to banking laws and\nregulations and various other laws and\nregulations, which affect the operations and\nmanagement of Truist and its ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. Refer\nto Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2019 for additional\ndisclosures with respect to significant laws\nand regulations affecting Truist.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant updates since the filing of the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 to state and federal laws to\nwhich Truist is subject. The descriptions are\nqualified in their entirety by reference to\nthe particular statutory or regulatory\nprovisions summarized. They do not summarize\nall possible or proposed changes in current\nlaws or regulations and are not intended to be\na substitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer and CCAR              \n                                              \nThe FRB has adopted a final rule that\nintegrates its annual capital planning and\nstress testing requirements with existing\nregulatory capital requirements. For risk-\nbased capital requirements, the stress capital\nbuffer replaces the existing capital\nconservation buffer, which is 2.5% as of\nJanuary 1, 2019. Under the final rule,\nbeginning in the 2020 CCAR cycle, Truist will\nbe required to calculate a stress capital\nbuffer equal to the greater of (i) the\ndifference between its starting and minimum\nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the\nseverely adverse scenario in the supervisory\nstress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount\nof Truist\u2019s planned common stock dividends for\neach of the fourth through seventh quarters of\nthe planning horizon as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%.\n\nThe final rule also makes related changes to\nthe capital planning and stress testing\nprocess. Among other changes, the revised\ncapital plan rule eliminates the assumption\nthat Truist\u2019s balance sheet assets would\nincrease over the planning horizon. In\naddition, provided that Truist is otherwise in\ncompliance with automatic restrictions on\ndistributions under the FRB\u2019s capital rules,\nTruist will no longer be required to seek\nprior approval to make capital distributions\nin excess of those included in its capital\nplan.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the FRB provided Truist with\na preliminary SCB of 2.7% and will provide the\nfinal SCB by August 31, 2020. The SCB will be\neffective from October 1, 2020 through\nSeptember 30, 2021, at which point a revised\nSCB will be calculated and provided to Truist.\nTruist has reviewed the results of the 2020\nCCAR supervisory stress test and noted that\nthe modeled outcomes shown by the FRB differ\nfrom those calculated by the Company. Truist\nbelieves those differences are attributable to\nthe application of purchase accounting\nassociated with the Merger. Purchase\naccounting adjustments could result in a\nreduction in provision expense and an increase\nin pre-provision net revenue. These\ndifferences could result in higher capital\nratios than were reflected in the CCAR\nresults.\n\nAt the same time, the FRB took several actions\nfollowing its stress tests in light of the\nuncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpecifically, for the third quarter of 2020,\nthe FRB will require certain large banking\norganizations, including Truist, to suspend\nshare repurchases, cap dividend payments to\nthe amount paid in the second quarter, and\nfurther limit dividends according to a formula\nbased on recent income. The FRB is also\nrequiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-\nterm capital plans.\n\nThese large banking organizations, including\nTruist, will be required to resubmit and\nupdate their capital plans later this year to\nreflect current stresses caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the FRB will conduct\nadditional analysis each quarter to determine\nif adjustments to this response are\nappropriate.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\nRevisions to Definition of Eligible Retained\nIncome\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies have adopted an\ninterim final rule altering the definition of\neligible retained income in their respective\ncapital rules. Under the new rule, eligible\nretained income is the greater of a firm\u2019s (i)\nnet income for the four preceding calendar\nquarters, net of any distributions and\nassociated tax effects not already reflected\nin net income, and (ii) average net income\nover the preceding four quarters. This\ndefinition applies with respect to all of\nTruist\u2019s capital requirements. The interim\nfinal rule became effective March 20, 2020.\n                                              \n  Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology  \n                                              \nThe U.S. banking agencies have adopted an\ninterim final rule that permits banking\norganizations that implement CECL before the\nend of 2020 to elect to follow the three-year\ntransition available under the prior rule or a\nnew five-year transition to phase in the\neffects of CECL on regulatory capital. Under\nthe five-year transition, the banking\norganization would defer for two years 100% of\nthe day-one effect of adopting CECL and 25% of\nthe cumulative increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses since adoption of CECL.\nFollowing the first two years, the electing\norganization will phase out the aggregate\ncapital effects over the next three years\nconsistent with the transition in the original\nthree-year transition rule. The interim final\nrule became effective March 31, 2020.

The\nCompany expects the effects of this health\ncrisis, which include disruptions or\nrestrictions in clients\u2019 supply chains,\nclosures of clients\u2019 facilities or decreases\nin demand for clients\u2019 products and services,\nto continue to adversely impact economic\nconditions. Also related to the health crisis,\nthe U.S. has been operating under a\npresidential declared emergency since March\n13, 2020, with various actions by the U.S.\nCongress and regulatory agencies. As a result\nof COVID-19, the Company experienced the\ndecline of asset prices, reduction in interest\nrates, widening of credit spreads, borrower\nand counterparty credit deterioration and\nmarket volatility. Although the Company is\nunable to estimate the extent of the impact,\nthe continuing pandemic and related global\neconomic crisis is likely to adversely impact\nits future operating results.\n\nTruist acted swiftly to support our clients,\nteammates and communities during the COVID-19\npandemic. The following are some significant\nactions related to our crisis response.\n\n\u2022 Third largest PPP lender based on gross\nfundings and the carrying value of PPP loans\nwas $12.0 billion as of June 30, 2020.\n\n\u2022 Provided accommodations to clients on $21.2\nbillion of commercial loans, $13.8 billion of\nconsumer loans, and $211 million of credit\ncard loans as of June 30, 2020, representing\n11.2% of loans and leases held for investment.\n\n\u2022 Pledged $50 million in philanthropic support\nthrough the Truist Cares initiative that is\nproviding aid for basic needs, medical\nsupplies and financial hardship across the\nnation, as well as grants to Truist\u2019s\ncommunity partners to support and expand\ntechnology initiatives and programs for youth,\nseniors, small businesses and people to\nrebuild, restore and create thriving\ncommunities.\n\n\u2022 Provided support for clients through payment\nrelief assistance, including payments\ndeferrals, waiving certain fees and offering\nadditional accommodations.\n\n\u2022 Implemented multiple strategies to keep our\nbranches operational and clients safe,\nincluding lobby access by appointment and the\nextensive use of drive-thrus.

Additionally, Truist\nfunded extensive line draws for commercial\nclients to help them fund liquidity and\nworking capital needs during the onset of the\npandemic. The majority of the line draws were\nrepaid during the second quarter as the\ngovernment programs were implemented and\nclients better understood their liquidity\nneeds.\n\n\u2022 Provided support for teammates including\nadditional paid time off, flexibility and\nfamily care benefits. Provided teammates who\nhave base pay below $100,000 annually a one-\ntime pre-tax bonus of $1,200 in March to\nrecognize their ongoing commitment to our\nclients and help alleviate some of the\nfinancial pressures caused by the pandemic.\nEnabled alternative work strategies that\nallowed more than half of our teammates to\nwork remotely.

Truist has also asked several\ncommunity partners to help shape and guide its\nlong-term actions.\n\nExecutive Leadership Changes\n\nOn June 30, 2020, Truist announced that\nKimberly Moore-Wright, Chief Human Resources\nOfficer, has been named to the Truist\nExecutive Leadership team, effectively\nimmediately. In December 2019, Moore-Wright\nwas named Chief Human Resources Officer. Prior\nto that, Moore-Wright was the Director of\nMarketing and Digital Sales between January\n2016 and November 2019 and the Director of\nRetail and Commercial Marketing Strategy\nbetween January 2012 and December 2015.\n\nAs part of the new reporting structure to\nelevate the areas of human resources and\ninclusion and diversity, both Moore-Wright and\nEllen Fitzsimmons, Chief Legal Officer and\nHead of Enterprise Diversity, will report\ndirectly to the Chairman and CEO, Kelly King.\n\nFinancial Results\n\nNet income available to common shareholders\nfor the second quarter of 2020 totaled $902\nmillion, up 7.1%, compared with the second\nquarter last year. On a diluted per common\nshare basis, earnings for the second quarter\nof 2020 were $0.67, a decrease of $0.42\ncompared to the second quarter of 2019.\nTruist's results of operations for the second\nquarter of 2020 produced an annualized return\non average assets of 0.75% and an annualized\nreturn on average common shareholders' equity\nof 5.90% compared to prior year returns of\n1.55% and 11.98%, respectively. Results for\nthe second quarter of 2020 included merger-\nrelated and restructuring charges of $209\nmillion ($160 million after-tax), incremental\noperating expenses related to the merger of\n$129 million ($99 million after-tax),\nsecurities gains of $300 million ($230 million\nafter-tax), and losses from the early\nextinguishment of long-term debt of $235\nmillion ($180 million after-tax). Results for\nthe second quarter of 2019 included $23\nmillion ($19 million after-tax) of merger-\nrelated and restructuring charges and $9\nmillion ($7 million after-tax) of incremental\noperating expenses related to the Merger.\n\nTruist\u2019s revenue for the second quarter of\n2020 was $5.9 billion. On a TE basis, revenue\nwas also $5.9 billion for the second quarter\nof 2020, an increase of $2.8 billion compared\nto the same period in 2019, which reflects an\nincrease of $1.8 billion in TE net interest\nincome and an increase of $1.1 billion in\nnoninterest income.\n\nThe increase in net interest income was\nprimarily due to the Merger, as average loans\nand leases increased $174.9 billion and\naverage securities increased $29.0 billion. In\naddition, average other earning assets\nincreased $39.8 billion due to higher interest\nbearing balances at the Federal Reserve as\nTruist increased liquidity in view of economic\nuncertainty and to increase Truist\u2019s capacity\nto support clients.\n\nNIM was 3.13% for the second quarter of 2020,\ndown 29 basis points compared to the prior\nyear. Average earning assets increased $246.0\nbillion, while average interest-bearing\nliabilities increased $182.7 billion and\nnoninterest-bearing deposits increased $61.2\nbillion. The annualized TE yield on the total\nloan portfolio for the second quarter of 2020\nwas 4.19%, down 86 basis points compared to\nthe prior year. The annualized TE yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 2.37%, down\n25 basis points compared to the prior year.\n\n50 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $844\nmillion compared to $172 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2019. The increase in the\nprovision for credit losses reflects a build\nto the allowance for credit losses due to\nincreased economic stress associated with the\npandemic and specific consideration of its\nimpact on certain industries, the impact of\nthe merger, and the effect of applying the\nCECL methodology in the current quarter\ncompared to the incurred loss methodology in\nthe earlier quarter. Higher net charge-offs\nalso contributed to the increase in the\nprovision for credit losses and primarily\nreflect increases as a result of the Merger.\nNet charge-offs were 0.39% of average loans\nand leases on an annualized basis for the\nsecond quarter of 2020, up one basis point\ncompared to the second quarter of 2019.\n\nNoninterest income for the second quarter of\n2020 increased $1.1 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter. The current quarter includes\n$300 million of securities gains from the sale\nof non-agency mortgage-backed securities.\nExcluding the securities gains, noninterest\nincome increased $771 million, with nearly all\ncategories of noninterest income being\nimpacted by the Merger. In addition to these\nimpacts, insurance income was a record $581\nmillion and residential mortgage banking\nincome was up due to strong production and\nrefinance activity driven by the declining\nrate environment, while service charges on\ndeposits were lower due to reduced overdraft\nincident rates and refunds and waivers to\nsupport clients impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nNoninterest expense for the second quarter of\n2020 was up $2.1 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter. The current quarter was\nimpacted by $235 million of losses on the\nearly extinguishment of long-term debt.\nExcluding merger-related and restructuring\ncharges, incremental operating expenses\nrelated to the Merger and losses on the early\nextinguishment of long-term debt, noninterest\nexpense was up $1.6 billion, primarily\nreflecting the impact of the Merger. In\naddition to the impacts of the merger,\noperating costs were elevated due to COVID-19,\nwhich resulted in an additional $115 million\nof expenses compared to the second quarter of\n2019. This was primarily related to additional\non-site pay for teammates, net occupancy costs\nfor enhanced cleaning and teammate support\nexpenses. Amortization of intangibles\nincreased $146 million due to the intangibles\nrecognized in the merger.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $191\nmillion for the second quarter of 2020,\ncompared to $234 million for the earlier\nquarter. This produced an effective tax rate\nfor the second quarter of 2020 of 16.6%,\ncompared to 20.9% for the earlier quarter. The\nlower effective tax rate is primarily due to\nhigher favorable permanent tax items and\nincome tax credits earned in the current year.\n\nTruist's total assets at June 30, 2020 were\n$504.3 billion, an increase of $31.3 billion\ncompared to December 31, 2019. The increase in\ntotal assets was primarily driven by an\nincrease of $12.9 billion in total loans and\nleases primarily due to an increase in\ncommercial and industrial loans as a result of\nPPP loans and other customer line draws. In\naddition, interest-bearing deposits with banks\nincreased $21.1 billion reflecting higher\nbalances held at the Federal Reserve.\n\nTotal deposits at June 30, 2020 were $376.2\nbillion, an increase of $41.5 billion compared\nto December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits\nreflects solid growth in all non-time deposit\nproducts due to a flight to quality and the\ngovernment stimulus programs.\n\nAsset quality ratios were relatively stable at\nJune 30, 2020, tempered by CARES Act relief.\nAs of June 30, 2020, nonperforming assets were\n0.25% of total assets. The allowance for loan\nand lease loss coverage ratio was 5.24x\nnonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment, compared to 3.41x at December 31,\n2019. The higher coverage ratio reflects the\nCECL adoption build of $3.1 billion, as well\nas $1.1 billion of reserve build in 2020 in\nconnection with COVID-19 and the economic\ndownturn. Commercial credit quality indicators\nreflect proactive grading changes for the\ncurrent environment.\n\nTruist maintained strong capital and\nliquidity. As of June 30, 2020, the CET1 ratio\nwas 9.7% and the average LCR was 116%. During\nthe six months ended June 30, 2020, Truist\nissued $2.6 billion of preferred stock and\nredeemed $500 million of Series K preferred\nstock. In August 2020, Truist issued $925\nmillion of preferred stock. The Company issued\n$5.8 billion of senior and subordinated long-\nterm debt. Truist declared common dividends of\n$0.450 per share during the second quarter of\n2020. Additionally, in August 2020, the\nCompany issued $750 million of senior notes\nwith an interest rate of 1.125% maturing\n2027.The dividend and total payout ratios for\nthe second quarter of 2020 were 67.2%. As\npreviously communicated at the time of the\nMerger announcement, Truist suspended its\nshare repurchase program until capital ratios\nreturn to higher levels. In July 2020, Truist\ndeclared common dividends of $0.450 per share\nfor the third quarter of 2020.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nSecond Quarter 2020 compared to Second Quarter\n2019\n\nNet interest margin was 3.13%, down 29 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter.\nAverage earning assets increased $246.0\nbillion. The increase in average earning\nassets reflects a $174.9 billion increase in\naverage total loans and leases and a $29.0\nbillion increase in average securities.\nAverage other earning assets increased $39.8\nbillion primarily due to higher interest-\nbearing balances at the Federal Reserve.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased\n$182.7 billion compared to the earlier\nquarter. Average interest-bearing deposits\nincreased $149.7 billion, average long-term\ndebt increased $32.3 billion and average\nshort-term borrowings increased $631 million.\nThe significant increases in earnings assets\nand liabilities are primarily due to the\nMerger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19\npandemic and the resulting government stimulus\nprograms.\n\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nsecond quarter of 2020 was 4.19%, down 86\nbasis points compared to the earlier quarter,\nreflecting the impact of rate decreases and\nthe deferral of interest for loans granted an\naccommodation in connection with COVID-19,\npartially offset by purchase accounting\naccretion from merged loans. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 2.37%, down\n25 basis points compared to the earlier period\nprimarily due to higher premium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.22%,\ndown 46 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter. The average cost of interest-bearing\ndeposits was 0.32%, down 70 basis points\ncompared to the earlier quarter. The average\nrate on short-term borrowings was 1.24%, down\n116 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter. The average rate on long-term debt\nwas 1.52%, down 181 basis points compared to\nthe earlier quarter. The lower rates on\ninterest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower\nrate environment. The lower rates on long-term\ndebt also reflect the amortization of the fair\nvalue mark on the assumed debt and the\nissuance of new long-term debt.\n\nSix Months of 2020 compared to Six Months of\n2019\n\nThe net interest margin was 3.34% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020, down 13 basis\npoints compared to the earlier period. Average\nearning assets increased $230.9 billion, which\nprimarily reflects a $166.9 billion increase\nin average total loans and leases, a $31.0\nbillion increase in average other earning\nassets and a $29.0 billion increase in average\nsecurities. The increase in average other\nearning assets primarily reflects higher\ninterest-bearing balances at the Federal\nReserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities\nincreased $176.5 billion, driven by an\nincrease of $141.7 billion in average\ninterest-bearing deposits, an increase of\n$27.8 billion in average long-term debt and an\nincrease of $6.9 billion in average short-term\nborrowings. The significant increases in\nearnings assets and liabilities are primarily\ndue to the Merger, as well as impacts from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government\nstimulus programs.\n\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 was 4.57%, down\n48 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod, reflecting the impact of rate\ndecreases and interest reserves that were\nrecorded to reflect management\u2019s best estimate\nof interest related to loans that had been\ngranted an accommodation in connection with\nCOVID-19 that may prove to be uncollectible,\npartially offset by purchase accounting\naccretion from merged loans. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 was 2.49%, down 12\nbasis points compared to the earlier period\nprimarily due to higher premium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.35%,\ndown 31 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod. The average cost of interest-bearing\ndeposits was 0.50%, down 49 basis points\ncompared to the earlier period. The average\nrate on short-term borrowings was 1.60%, down\n77 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod. The average rate on long-term debt was\n1.90%, down 141 basis points compared to the\nearlier period. The decrease in rates on\ndeposits was largely attributable to deposit\nrate cuts consistent with a lower rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the remaining unamortized\nfair value marks on the loan and lease\nportfolio, deposits and long-term debt were\n$3.1 billion, $37 million and $262 million,\nrespectively.

Within the commercial and\nindustrial portfolio, Truist also experienced\ngrowth in loans from mortgage warehouse\nlending due to the decline in rates and\nincreased refinance activity, which was\npartially offset by a decline in dealer floor\nplan lending.\n\nAverage consumer loans decreased $1.1 billion,\nprimarily due to a decrease in residential\nmortgages due to refinance activity,\nunderwriting changes and overall decreased\ndemand for consumer lending products. This was\npartially offset by an increase in indirect\nother loans due to demand for loans to finance\nrecreational and power sports equipment.\n\nAverage credit card loans decreased due to\nlower business and consumer spending as a\nresult of COVID-19.\n                                              \n  COVID-19 Lending Activities                 \n                                              \nThe CARES Act includes provisions that were\ndesigned to encourage financial institutions\nto support borrowers impacted by COVID-19.\nThese modifications are generally not\nconsidered a TDR as disclosed in \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation.\u201d Truist payment relief\nassistance includes forbearance, deferrals,\nextension and re-aging programs, along with\ncertain other modification strategies.

Nonperforming loans and leases\nheld for investment represented 0.35% of loans\nand leases held for investment, up 3 basis\npoints compared to March 31, 2020. The\nincrease in nonperforming loans was primarily\nin the commercial real estate, commercial\nconstruction and leasing portfolios. Within\nthe consumer portfolio, residential mortgage\nnonaccruals were down due to certain loans\nbeing identified and moved to the held for\nsale portfolio, while indirect automobile\nnonaccruals increased as a result of the\nmoratorium on repossessions under the CARES\nAct.

The decline was primarily due to a\ndecrease in government guaranteed student\nloans due to forbearance programs that were\nput in place by the servicer of the loans\nimplemented in connection with the CARES Act.\nThe ratio of loans 90 days or more past due\nand still accruing as a percentage of loans\nand leases was 0.34% at June 30, 2020, down 21\nbasis points from the prior quarter. Excluding\ngovernment guaranteed loans, the ratio of\nloans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing as a percentage of loans and leases\nwas 0.03% at June 30, 2020, down one basis\npoint from 0.04% at March 31, 2020.\n\nLoans 30-89 days past due and still accruing\ntotaled $1.9 billion at June 30, 2020, down\n$473 million compared to the prior quarter.\nThe decline is primarily due to a decrease in\nindirect automobile and government guaranteed\nstudent loans due to deferral and forbearance\nprograms implemented in connection with CARES\nAct. The ratio of loans 30-89 days or more\npast due and still accruing as a percentage of\nloans and leases was 0.60% at June 30, 2020,\ndown 14 basis point from the prior quarter.\n\nProblem loans include NPLs and loans that are\n90 days or more past due and still accruing as\ndisclosed in Table 10.

As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES\nAct, Truist implemented loan modification\nprograms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nin order to provide borrowers with flexibility\nwith respect to repayment terms. These loan\nmodifications are generally not considered\nTDRs at the time of modification to the extent\nthat the borrower was impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and was less than 30 days past due at\nDecember 31, 2019, or in certain\ncircumstances, at the time that the COVID-19\nloan modification program was implemented,\nunless the loan was previously classified as a\nTDR.\n\nTDRs identified by SunTrust prior to the\nMerger date are not included in Truist's TDR\ndisclosure because all such loans were\nrecorded at fair value and a new accounting\nbasis was established as of the Merger date.\nSubsequent modifications will be evaluated for\npotential treatment as TDRs in accordance with\nTruist's accounting policies.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\nperforming TDR

credit\nlosses, including $2.8 billion that was\ncharged to retained earnings before tax, and\n$378 million related to the gross up for PCD\nloans. The remaining increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses primarily reflects\ndeteriorated economic conditions. As of June\n30, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses was 1.81% of loans and leases held for\ninvestment. The allowance for credit losses\nincludes $5.7 billion for loans and leases and\n$431 million for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments.\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses was\n5.24 times nonperforming loans and leases held\nfor investment at June 30, 2020, compared to\n5.04 times at March 31, 2020. At June 30,\n2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses\nwas 4.49 times annualized net charge-offs,\ncompared to 4.76 times at March 31, 2020.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 67\nNet charge-offs during the second quarter\ntotaled $316 million, up $44 million compared\nto the prior quarter. As a percentage of\naverage loans and leases, annualized net\ncharge-offs were 0.39%, up three basis points\ncompared to the prior quarter. For the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020, net charge-offs\nwere $588 million compared to $289 million for\nthe same period of the prior year. The net\ncharge-off rate was 0.38% of average loans and\nleases for the six months ended June 30, 2020,\ncompared to 0.39% of average loans and leases\nfor the earlier period. The increases in net\ncharge-offs were primarily due to the merger.\n\nThe following table presents an allocation of\nthe ALLL.

Truist also\nreceives notification when the first lien\nholder, whether Truist or another financial\ninstitution, has initiated foreclosure\nproceedings against the borrower. When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nAs a result, using migration assumptions that\nare based on historical experience and\nadjusted for current trends, Truist estimates\nthe volume of second lien positions where the\nfirst lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL\nto reflect the increased risk of loss on these\ncredits. Finally, Truist also provides\nadditional reserves for second lien positions\nwhen the estimated combined current loan to\nvalue ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. As of\nJune 30, 2020, Truist held or serviced the\nfirst lien on 31.0% of its second lien\npositions.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 17:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in               June 30,         December  \n  millions)            2020         31, 2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life         $      6,430    $       6,383  \n  insurance                                   \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other           5,470            5,448  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension             3,946            3,579  \n  assets                                      \n  Accounts            2,524            2,418  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Derivati\u2026           4,214            2,053  \n  assets                                      \n  Lease                                       \n  assets -                                    \n  leased                                      \n  assets              1,953            1,897  \n  and                                         \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  ROU                 1,724            1,823  \n  assets                                      \n  Accrued             1,933            1,807  \n  income                                      \n  Prepaid             1,242            1,254  \n  expenses                                    \n  Structur\u2026                                   \n  real                  686              987  \n  estate                                      \n  Equity                                      \n  securiti\u2026             642              817  \n  at fair                                     \n  value                                       \n  FHLB                  229              764  \n  stock                                       \n  Other                 749            2,602  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $     31,742    $      31,832  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents deposits for each\nof the last five quarters:\n                                              \n         \u2026       M\u2026       \u2026       S\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  9\u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       9\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       6\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       9\u2026       \u2014  \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \nDeposits totaled $376.2 billion at June 30,\n2020, an increase of $41.5 billion from\nDecember 31, 2019.

Average\ndeposit growth was strong for the second\nquarter of 2020 due to a continuation of the\nflight to quality and government stimulus\nprograms.

Average short-term\nborrowings were $9.0 billion, or 2.1% of total\nfunding for the second quarter 2020, as\ncompared to $8.4 billion, or 4.4% for the\nprior year quarter as these funding sources\nwere largely replaced by the strong deposit\ngrowth.\n\nLong-term debt provides funding and, to a\nlesser extent, regulatory capital, and\nprimarily consists of senior and subordinated\nnotes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-\nterm debt totaled $42.1 billion at June 30,\n2020, an increase of $794 million compared to\nDecember 31, 2019. The increase included\nissuances of $4.0 billion of senior notes with\ninterest rates from 1.20% to 1.95% maturing in\n2023 to 2030, $500 million in floating rate\nsenior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion\nof subordinated notes with an interest rate of\n2.25% maturing in 2030. These increases were\npartially offset by the redemption of $3.7\nbillion of senior notes during the first half\nof 2020 and a decrease of $1.5 billion in\nlong-term FHLB advances. The average cost of\nlong-term debt was 1.90% for the six months\nended June 30, 2020, down 141 basis points\ncompared to the same period in 2019. FHLB\nadvances represented 6.3% of total outstanding\nlong-term debt at June 30, 2020, compared to\n10.0% at December 31, 2019. Truist entered\ninto $20 billion of FHLB advances during the\nfirst quarter of 2020 to build liquidity and\nensure the Company was able to meet the\nfunding needs of its clients. As market\nconditions stabilized and deposits increased,\nthese advances were redeemed during the second\nquarter of 2020 and the Company recognized a\nloss of $235 million on the early\nextinguishment of debt. The redemption of\nthese advances will improve net interest\nincome, the net interest margin and the\nleverage ratios.\n\nIn August 2020, Truist also issued $750\nmillion of senior notes with an interest rate\nof 1.125% maturing 2027.\n\nShareholders' Equity\n\nTotal shareholders' equity was $68.9 billion\nat June 30, 2020, an increase of $2.3 billion\nfrom December 31, 2019. This increase includes\nthe issuance of $2.6 billion of preferred\nstock during the second quarter of 2020, $2.0\nbillion in net income available to common\nshareholders and an increase of $1.7 billion\nin AOCI, which was partially offset by $2.1\nbillion related to the adoption of CECL and\n$1.3 billion for common and preferred\ndividends. In addition, Truist redeemed $500\nmillion of its Series K preferred stock during\nthe first quarter of 2020. Truist's book value\nper common share at June 30, 2020 was $45.74,\ncompared to $45.66 at December 31, 2019.\n\nRefer to \"Note 10.

Effective risk management involves\nappropriately managing risk to optimize risk\nand return, and operate in a safe and sound\nmanner while ensuring compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations. The Company\u2019s\nrisk management framework is designed to\nensure that business strategies and objectives\nare executed in alignment with its risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports transparency and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate's adherence to, and successful\nimplementation of, Truist's risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany's compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the risks\nassociated with integrating heritage BB&T and\nheritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive\nLeadership oversee the change management\nprogram, which is designed to ensure key\ndecisions are reviewed and that there is\nappropriate oversight of integration\nactivities.\n\nRefer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \"Risk Management.\"\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Market risk management                      \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility or correlations among\nfinancial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist's strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist's most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk\nand volatility risk in Truist's BUs. Interest\nrate risk results from differences between the\ntiming of rate changes and the timing of cash\nflows associated with assets and liabilities\n(re-pricing risk); from changing rate\nrelationships among different yield curves\naffecting bank activities (basis risk); from\nchanging rate relationships across the\nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and\nfrom interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income and capital\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest rate market risk (other than       \n  trading)                                    \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk both on its assets and\non its liabilities. Since interest rate\nchanges are out of the control of any private\nsector institution, Truist actively manages\nits interest rate risk exposure through the\nstrategic repricing of its assets and\nliabilities, taking into account the volumes,\nmaturities and mix, with the goal of keeping\nnet interest margin as stable as possible.\nTruist primarily uses three methods to measure\nand monitor its interest rate risk: (i)\nsimulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist's\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes and projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas are an important assumption in\nthe interest rate risk modeling process.\nTruist applies an average deposit beta (the\nsensitivity of deposit rate changes relative\nto market rate changes) of approximately 50%\nto its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit\naccounts for determining its interest rate\nsensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing\ndeposit accounts include interest checking\naccounts, savings accounts and money market\naccounts that do not have a contractual\nmaturity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact they could have on the\nCompany\u2019s interest rate risk position. The\npredictive value of the simulation model\ndepends upon the accuracy of the assumptions,\nbut management believes that it provides\nhelpful information for the management of\ninterest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n  \u2026                                        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                        \u2026  \n  \u2026                                        \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    P\u2026                                     \n  \u2026    R\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n       J\u2026       J\u2026       J\u2026       J\u2026          \n       3\u2026       3\u2026       3\u2026       3\u2026          \n       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026          \n  \u2026    4\u2026  %    6\u2026  %    2\u2026  %    0\u2026  %       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    3\u2026       6\u2026       1\u2026       0\u2026          \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    3\u2026       5\u2026        \u2014        \u2014          \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    3\u2026       5\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026          \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    2\u2026       5\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026          \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nRate sensitivity increased compared to the\nprior periods, primarily driven by loan and\ndeposit mix changes related to the Merger and\nrecent activity, increased fixed rate funding,\nand increased noninterest-bearing deposits.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nTruist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on\nlonger-term projected changes in asset and\nliability values given potential changes in\ninterest rates.

Truist also\nuses derivatives to facilitate transactions on\nbehalf of its clients and as part of\nassociated hedging activities. As of June 30,\n2020, Truist had derivative financial\ninstruments outstanding with notional amounts\ntotaling $321.8 billion, with an associated\nnet fair value of $3.8 billion. See \"Note 16.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\" for\nadditional disclosures.\n\nLIBOR in its current form may no longer be\navailable after 2021. Truist has LIBOR-based\ncontracts that extend beyond 2021. To prepare\nfor the possible transition to an alternative\nreference rate, management has formed a cross-\nfunctional project team to address the LIBOR\ntransition. The project team has performed an\nassessment to identify the potential risks\nrelated to the transition from LIBOR to a new\nindex. The project team provides regular\nreports to the Board.\n\nThe project team is reviewing contract\nfallback language for loans and leases and\nnoted that certain contracts will need updated\nprovisions for the transition, and the team is\ncoordinating with impacted lines of business\nto update LIBOR fallback language generally\nconsistent with the ARRC recommendation.\nTruist is continuing to evaluate the impact on\nthese contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and other related operational and\nmarket risks. Market risks associated with\nthis change are dependent on the alternative\nreference rates available and market\nconditions at transition. For a further\ndiscussion of the various risks associated\nwith the potential cessation of LIBOR and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates,\nrefer to the section titled \"Item 1A. Risk\nFactors\" in the Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel to ensure exposures are in line with\nTruist's risk appetite.\n\nTruist is subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered trading positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements, or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for our clients, as\nwell as associated risk mitigating hedging\nactivity. The trading portfolio, measured in\nterms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-\nportfolios of covered positions: (i) credit\ntrading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii)\ninterest rate derivatives and (iv) equity\nderivatives. As a market maker across\ndifferent asset classes, Truist\u2019s trading\nportfolio also contains other sub-portfolios,\nincluding foreign exchange, loan trading, and\ncommodity derivatives; however, these\nportfolios do not generate material trading\nrisk exposures.\n\nValuation policies, procedures, and\nmethodologies exist for all covered positions.\nAdditionally, trading positions are subject to\nindependent price verification. See \"Note 16.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\u201d \"Note 15.\nFair Value Disclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical\nAccounting Policies\u201d herein for discussion of\nvaluation policies, procedures and\nmethodologies.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\nless than $1 million, all of which were non-\nagency asset backed securities positions.\nConsistent with the Market Risk Rule\nrequirements, the Company performs pre-\npurchase due diligence on each securitization\nposition to identify the characteristics\nincluding, but not limited to, deal structure\nand the asset quality of the underlying\nassets, that materially affect valuation and\nperformance. Securitization positions are\nsubject to Truist\u2019s comprehensive risk\nmanagement framework, which includes daily\nmonitoring against a suite of limits. There\nwere no off-balance sheet securitization\npositions during the reporting period.\n\nCorrelation trading positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of June 30, 2020.\n\nVaR-based measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. Following the\nMerger, Truist elected to migrate all covered\npositions to the heritage SunTrust VaR system\nand methodology. For an interim period,\nhowever, VaR for a subset of heritage BB&T\npositions, specifically those covered\npositions held in BB&T Securities, will be\ncalculated using the heritage BB&T VaR system\nand methodology. As such, pending full\nintegration, Truist will operate two\nhistorical VaR models and aggregate company-\nwide VaR across the systems will be determined\nadditively with no benefit of diversification.\nFor risk management purposes, the VaR\ncalculation is based on a historical\nsimulation approach and measures the potential\ntrading losses using a one-day holding period\nat a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For\nMarket Risk Rule purposes, the Company\ncalculates VaR using a 10-day holding period\nand a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent\nlimitations of the VaR methodology, such as\nthe assumption that past market behavior is\nindicative of future market performance, VaR\nis only one of several tools used to measure\nand manage market risk. Other tools used to\nactively manage market risk include stress\ntesting, profit and loss attribution, and stop\nloss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios. As such, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories thereby creating portfolio\ndiversification benefit. The following table\nsummarizes certain VaR-based measures for both\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2020\nand 2019. The increase from the prior year was\nmainly due to the integration of the heritage\nSunTrust trading business and the market\nvolatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As\nillustrated in the table below, the inclusion\nof volatility levels observed in March and\nApril in the 12 month VaR historic look back\nwindow led to a convergence between VaR and\nother stressed measures of risk based on risk\nfactors observed during the 2008/2009\nfinancial crisis.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for our\ntrading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR model backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model.\n\nThere were nine company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions during the twelve months ended June\n30, 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19\npandemic which led to a sudden and significant\nrepricing of financial markets, amid an\nincrease in market volatility and\ndeterioration in overall market liquidity. In\naccordance with established policy and\nprocedure, all company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nFollowing such reviews, it was determined that\nthe VaR model performed in line with\nexpectations. However, the extreme moves in\nunderlying market risk factors caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic would not typically have\nbeen captured within the 1-day VaR measure.\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel risk management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company's comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, to ensure that both\ncurrent and emerging risks are captured\nappropriately. Management also utilizes stress\nanalyses to support the Company\u2019s capital\nadequacy assessment standards. See the\n\u201cCapital\u201d section of this MD&A for additional\ndiscussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist's funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position, and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities. As of June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, Truist's liquid asset buffer, as a\npercent of total assets, was 17.8% and 16.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nThe LCR rule directs large U.S. banking\norganizations to hold unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets sufficient to withstand\nprojected 30-day total net cash outflows, each\nas defined under the LCR rule. As of January\n1, 2020, Truist is subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements (85% of the full\nrequirements). Truist's average LCR was 116%\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2020, well\nabove the regulatory minimum.\n\nThe ability to raise funding at competitive\nprices is affected by the rating agencies'\nviews of the Parent Company's and Truist\nBank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and\nearnings. Management meets with the rating\nagencies on a regular basis to discuss current\noutlooks. In April 2020, DBRS revised its\noutlook for Truist and Truist Bank from\n\u201cpositive\u201d to \u201cstable,\u201d citing economic\ndeterioration related to COVID-19. DBRS\naffirmed all other ratings for Truist and\nTruist Bank. Additionally, Fitch revised its\noutlook for Truist and Truist Bank from\n\u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative,\u201d also citing pandemic-\nrelated economic deterioration. Fitch\ndowngraded Truist\u2019s subordinated debt to A-,\nand upgraded Truist\u2019s preferred stock to BBB,\nin order to align these ratings to its\nrecently revised bank rating methodology. In\nJuly 2020, Fitch completed the implementation\nof its revised bank rating methodology. As a\nresult, Fitch downgraded Truist\u2019s senior\nunsecured debt to A and affirmed Truist Bank\u2019s\nsenior unsecured and subordinated debt\nratings. The rating actions taken by Fitch\nwere solely a function of implementing its\nrevised bank rating methodology and did not\nreflect a change in Fitch\u2019s current or\nexpected view of Truist\u2019s or Truist Bank\u2019s\ncredit fundamentals. See \"Liquidity\" section\nof the MD&A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\nadditional information regarding credit\nratings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company's assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\naccounts receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, retirement of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 75\nSee \"Note 22. Parent Company Financial\nInformation\" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\n\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the Parent Company had 41\nmonths and 29 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n21 months and 20 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nTruist Bank\n\nTruist carefully manages liquidity risk at\nTruist Bank. Truist Bank's primary source of\nfunding is client deposits. Continued access\nto client deposits is highly dependent on\npublic confidence in the stability of Truist\nBank and its ability to return funds to\nclients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. At June 30, 2020, Truist Bank\nhad approximately $166.1 billion of available\nsecured borrowing capacity, which represents\napproximately 4.3 times the amount of one-year\nwholesale funding maturities. In addition to\nsecured borrowing sources, Truist had excess\neligible cash at the Federal Reserve Bank of\n$35.8 billion at June 30, 2020.\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments,\nContingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\n\nRefer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\ndiscussion with respect to Truist's\nquantitative and qualitative disclosures about\nits fixed and determinable contractual\nobligations. Truist's commitments include\ninvestments in affordable housing projects\nthroughout its market area, renewable energy\ncredits, private equity funds, derivative\ncontracts to manage various financial risks,\nas well as other commitments. Refer to \"Note\n14. Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d \u201cNote 15.\nFair Value Disclosures\u201d and \u201cNote 16.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d in this Form\n10-Q, and \u201cNote 16. Commitments and\nContingencies\" of the Annual Report on Form\n10-K for further discussion of these\ncommitments.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist's\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist's risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries and provide a competitive return\nto shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios,\nwhich include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\nTotal capital are calculated based on\nregulatory guidance related to the measurement\nof capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company's capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management's overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \"well capitalized\"\nminimums. Management has implemented stressed\ncapital ratio minimum targets to evaluate\nwhether capital ratios calculated after the\neffect of alternative capital actions are\nlikely to remain above minimums specified by\nthe FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches\nof stressed minimum targets prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist's capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Truist targets are subject to revision\nbased on finalization of pending regulatory\nguidance and other strategic factors.\n\n(2) Truist's goal is to maintain capital\nlevels above all regulatory minimums.\n\n(3) The current capital conservation buffer of\n250 basis points will be replaced by the\nstress capital buffer effective October 1,\n2020.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, as market\nconditions evolved, Truist received Board\napproval to establish new interim operating\ntargets that provide for sufficient capital\nlevels while allowing the company to support\nclients through the economic downturn. These\ninterim operating targets will be evaluated as\neconomic conditions evolve.\n\nWhile nonrecurring events or management\ndecisions may result in the Company\ntemporarily falling below its operating\nminimum guidelines for one or more of these\nratios, it is management's intent to return to\nthese targeted operating minimums within a\nreasonable period of time through capital\nplanning. Such temporary decreases below the\noperating minimums shown above are not\nconsidered an infringement of Truist's overall\ncapital policy, provided a return above the\nminimums is forecasted to occur within a\nreasonable time period.\n\nIn June 2020, the Federal Reserve informed\nTruist of its preliminary SCB of 270 basis\npoints for risk-based capital ratios. This\nbuffer, which is determined based on stress\ntesting results developed by the Federal\nReserve, is 20 basis points above the existing\nCapital Conservation Buffer. The Federal\nReserve will provide Truist its final SCB by\nAugust 31, 2020. The SCB will be effective\nfrom October 1, 2020 through September 30,\n2021, at which point a revised SCB will be\ncalculated and provided to Truist. Consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate across the\nindustry, Truist will be required to update\nand resubmit its capital plan later this year\nto reflect changes in financial markets and\nthe macroeconomic outlook. Truist has reviewed\nthe results of the 2020 CCAR supervisory\nstress test and noted that the modeled\noutcomes shown by the FRB differ from those\ncalculated by the Company. Truist believes\nthose differences are attributable to the\napplication of purchase accounting associated\nwith the Merger. Purchase accounting\nadjustments could result in a reduction in\nprovision expense and an increase in pre-\nprovision net revenue. These differences could\nresult in higher capital ratios than were\nreflected in the CCAR results.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\nTruist's capital ratios are presented in the\nfollowing table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  25:                                         \n  Capit\u2026                                      \n  Ratios                                      \n  -                                           \n  Truist                                      \n  Finan\u2026                                      \n  Corpo\u2026                                      \n  (Doll\u2026                                      \n  in                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  except                                      \n  per                                         \n  share                                       \n  data,                                       \n  shares                                      \n  in            Jun 30,          Dec 31,      \n  thous\u2026           2020             2019      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk-\u2026       -prelim\u2026                       \n  CET1                                        \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  to                9.7  %           9.5  %   \n  risk-\u2026                                      \n  assets                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  to               11.5             10.8      \n  risk-\u2026                                      \n  assets                                      \n  Total                                       \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  to               13.9             12.6      \n  risk-\u2026                                      \n  assets                                      \n  Lever\u2026            9.0             14.7      \n  ratio                                       \n  Suppl\u2026                                      \n  lever\u2026            8.5                   NA  \n  ratio                                       \n  Non-G\u2026                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  measu\u2026                                      \n  (1):                                        \n  Tangi\u2026                                      \n  common                                      \n  equity    $     26.38       $    25.93      \n  per                                         \n  common                                      \n  share                                       \n  Calcu\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  tangi\u2026                                      \n  common                                      \n  equity                                      \n  (1):                                        \n  Total                                       \n  share\u2026    $    68,883       $   66,558      \n  equity                                      \n  Less:                                       \n  Prefe\u2026          7,143            5,102      \n  stock                                       \n  Nonco\u2026            106              174      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Goodw\u2026                                      \n  and                                         \n  intan\u2026                                      \n  asset\u2026         26,083           26,482      \n  net of                                      \n  defer\u2026                                      \n  taxes                                       \n  Tangi\u2026                                      \n  common    $    35,551       $   34,800      \n  equity                                      \n  Risk-\u2026    $   383,430       $  376,056      \n  assets                                      \n  Common                                      \n  shares                                      \n  outst\u2026       1,347,6\u2026          1,342,\u2026      \n  at end                                      \n  of                                          \n  period                                      \n                                              \n(1) Tangible common equity and related\nmeasures are non-GAAP measures that exclude\nthe impact of intangible assets, net of\ndeferred taxes, and their related\namortization. These measures are useful for\nevaluating the performance of a business\nconsistently, whether acquired or developed\ninternally. Truist's management uses these\nmeasures to assess the quality of capital and\nreturns relative to balance sheet risk. These\ncapital measures are not necessarily\ncomparable to similar capital measures that\nmay be presented by other companies.\n\nCapital ratios improved compared to year-end\n2019, due to growth in CET1 capital, partially\noffset by higher risk-weighted assets.\nTruist's capital levels remain strong compared\nto the regulatory levels for well capitalized\nbanks at June 30, 2020. Truist\u2019s other capital\nmeasures also improved as Truist issued\nvarious capital instruments to strengthen its\ncapital position. Truist issued $2.6 billion\nof preferred stock and redeemed $500 million\nof Series K preferred stock during the first\nsix months of 2020. In August 2020, Truist\nissued $925 million of preferred stock. In\naddition, Truist issued $1.3 billion of\nsubordinated debt. Truist declared common\ndividends of $0.450 per share during the\nsecond quarter of 2020. The dividend and total\npayout ratios for the second quarter of 2020\nwere 67.2%.

Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations and related disclosures. The more\ncritical policies include accounting for the\nACL, determining fair value of financial\ninstruments, intangible assets, income taxes\nand costs and benefit obligations associated\nwith pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nUnderstanding Truist's accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. The critical accounting policies\nare discussed in MD&A in Truist's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Significant accounting\npolicies and changes in accounting principles\nand effects of new accounting pronouncements\nare discussed in \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d in Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Additional disclosures\nregarding the effects of new accounting\npronouncements are included in the \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation\u201d included herein. Except\nfor the items noted below, there have been no\nchanges to the significant accounting policies\nduring 2020.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nThe severe economic disruption and related\nfinancial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nhave impacted Truist\u2019s businesses. Truist\u2019s\ncommercial clients have experienced varying\nlevels of disruptions to business activity,\nsupply chains and demand for products and\nservices. Additionally, many consumer clients\nhave experienced interrupted income or\nunemployment. The pandemic also has resulted\nin continuing volatility to the global and\nU.S. financial markets, although intensive\nrelief actions by the U.S. Congress and\nregulatory agencies intended to mitigate the\nextent of adverse economic effects have\nstabilized financial markets and liquidity,\nincluding with respect to equity prices and\ncorporate credit spreads for Truist and the\nbanking sector, in comparison to the prior\nquarter.\n\nAs a result of these considerations, Truist\nperformed a qualitative assessment of the\ngoodwill carried by the CB&W, C&CB and IH\nreporting units for impairment in the second\nquarter of 2020 to determine whether it was\nmore-likely-than-not the fair value of one or\nmore of its reporting units was below its\nrespective carrying amount as of period-end.\nIn performing this assessment, Truist\nconsidered macroeconomic and market factors,\nindustry and banking sector events, a\nsensitivity analysis on management\u2019s forecast\nand assumptions, and Truist specific\nperformance indicators, including any changes\nfrom when the Merger closed in December 2019.\nDespite the adverse economic and still\nuncertain environment caused by the pandemic,\nTruist\u2019s second quarter 2020 results reflected\nprofitable performance across each of its\nreporting units; strong capital and liquidity\nlevels that have facilitated swift actions in\nsupport of clients, teammates and communities;\nand Truist\u2019s affirmation that it remains\ncommitted to achieving its Merger value\nproposition, including targeted net cost\nsaves.\n\nBased on the qualitative assessment performed,\nTruist concluded that it was not more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of one or more of\nits reporting units is below its respective\ncarrying amount as of June 30, 2020, and\ntherefore no triggering event occurred that\nrequired a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest. If economic conditions deteriorate, or\nthe pandemic\u2019s effects prolong or worsen, it\nmay be more-likely-than-not that the fair\nvalue of one or more of Truist\u2019s reporting\nunits falls below its respective carrying\namount, which would require a quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test.\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nTruist's policy is to maintain an ACL, which\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to the\nloan and lease portfolios and off-balance\nsheet lending commitments at the balance sheet\ndate. Estimates of expected future loan and\nlease losses are determined by using\nstatistical models and management\u2019s judgement.\nThe models are designed to forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic variables to historical\nexperience. The models are generally applied\nat the portfolio level to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic data used in the models is based\non forecasted variables for the reasonable and\nsupportable period of two years. Beyond this\nforecast period the models gradually revert to\nan historical average over a one year period.\nExpected losses are estimated through\ncontractual maturity, giving appropriate\nconsideration to expected prepayments unless\nthe borrower has a right to renew that is not\ncancellable or it is reasonably expected that\nthe loan will be modified as a TDR.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to capture risks in the\nportfolio such as considerations with respect\nto the impact of current economic events, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain. These events\nmay include, but are not limited to, political\nconditions, legislation that may directly or\nindirectly affect the banking industry and\neconomic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which\nTruist conducts business.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 79\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics and significant loans\nthat are considered collateral-dependent are\nindividually evaluated. For these loans, the\nALLL is determined through review of data\nspecific to the borrower and related\ncollateral, if any. For TDRs, default\nexpectations and estimated prepayment speeds\nthat are specific to each of the restructured\nloan populations are incorporated in the\ndetermination of the ALLL.\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is inherently similar to that\nused to determine the funded component of the\nALLL and is measured over the period there is\na contractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.

Additional risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to Truist or that management\nhas deemed to be immaterial also may\nmaterially adversely affect Truist's business,\nfinancial condition, or operating results.\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 have adversely\nimpacted, and will likely continue to\nadversely impact, the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted\nalmost all economic activity in the U.S.\nDespite the partial lifting of federal and\nstate shelter-in-place orders, some of which\nhave been renewed, it remains unknown when\nthere will be a return to normal economic\nactivity due to the recent rise in cases, and\nincreased economic stress associated with the\npandemic. Truist has temporarily limited\naccess to certain offices, limited branches to\ndrive-thru and appointment only, suspended\nsome services and the majority of the\nCompany\u2019s workforce is working remotely.\nCommercial clients are experiencing varying\nlevels of disruptions or restrictions on their\nbusiness activity and supply chains, closures\nof facilities or decreases in demand for their\nproducts and services. Consumer clients are\nexperiencing interrupted income or\nunemployment. Certain industries have been\nparticularly susceptible to the effects of the\npandemic, such as hotels, resorts, cruise\nlines, oil and gas companies, senior and acute\ncare facilities, restaurants, and other\nsensitive retail businesses, and Truist has\noutstanding loans to clients in these\nindustries. In addition, in March 2020,\nMoody\u2019s Investor Services downgraded its\noutlook on U.S. banks to \u201cnegative\u201d from\n\u201cstable\u201d due in part to the concerns presented\nby the pandemic. The global financial markets\nhave also experienced significant volatility.\nThe duration of this severe economic\ndisruption and its related financial impact\ncannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic have already\nresulted in an increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses, a reduction of fee income, a\nreduction of net interest margin and an\nincrease in expenses. Prolonged continuation\nof current conditions could worsen these\nimpacts and also affect the Company\u2019s capital\nand liquidity position, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair\nthe value of collateral securing loans, cause\nan outflow of deposits, cause significant\nproperty damage, in case of civil unrest or\nvandalism, influence the recognition of credit\nlosses on loans and securities and further\nincrease the allowance for credit losses,\nresult in additional lost revenue, cause\nadditional increases in expenses, result in\ngoodwill impairment charges, result in the\nimpairment of other financial and nonfinancial\nassets, and increase the Company\u2019s cost of\ncapital.\n\nIntensive government actions to mitigate the\neconomic suffering caused by the pandemic may\nnot be successful or may result in increased\npressure on the banking sector. Net interest\nmargin has been, and is likely to continue to\nbe, affected by the very low interest rate\nenvironment. The application of forbearance\nand payment deferral policies beyond any\nstatutory requirements may impact Truist\u2019s\ninterest income. Truist participated in the\nSBA\u2019s PPP as an eligible lender with the\nbenefit of a government guaranty of loans to\nsmall business clients, many of whom may face\ndifficulties even after being granted such a\nloan. The Company has registered to\nparticipate in Federal Reserve supported\nlending programs for Main Street-eligible\nborrowers as well. The Company faces increased\nrisks, in terms of credit, fraud risk and\nlitigation, in light of participation in these\nprograms. Truist has already been named in\nseveral lawsuits relating to its participation\nin the PPP.\n\nIt is possible that the pandemic and its\naftermath will lead to a prolonged economic\nslowdown or recession in the U.S. economy or\nthe world economy in general. The ultimate\nimpact on the Company\u2019s financial condition,\nresults of operation, and liquidity and\ncapital position will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\ncannot be predicted, including new information\nwhich may emerge concerning the severity of\nthe pandemic and the actions to contain or\ntreat its impact. Moreover, the effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic will heighten the other\nrisks described in the section entitled \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in the most recent Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.
