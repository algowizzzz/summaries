  \n       risk management oversight functions    \n  \u2022    may not identify or address risks      \n       adequately;                            \n       unfavorable resolution of legal        \n       proceedings or other claims or         \n       regulatory or other governmental       \n       investigations or inquiries could      \n       result in negative publicity,          \n       protests, fines, penalties,            \n  \u2022    restrictions on Truist's operations    \n       or ability to expand its business or   \n       other negative consequences, all of    \n       which could cause reputational damage  \n       and adversely impact Truist's          \n       financial condition and results of     \n       operations;

          \n  NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q\nand, therefore, do not include all information\nand notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited financial\nstatements but does not include all\ndisclosures required by GAAP. The information\ncontained in the financial statements and\nnotes included in the Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019\nshould be referred to in connection with these\nunaudited interim consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company updated its accounting\npolicies in connection with recently adopted\naccounting standards. There were no other\nsignificant changes to the Company\u2019s\naccounting policies from those disclosed in\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2019 that could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods'\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nfinancial instruments; valuation of MSRs;\ngoodwill, intangible assets and other purchase\naccounting related adjustments; benefit plan\nobligations and expenses; and tax assets,\nliabilities and expense.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance over an\nentire interest rate cycle. Investments in\ndebt securities that are not held for trading\npurposes are classified as HTM or AFS. Truist\ndoes not currently have any securities\nclassified as HTM.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nAFS securities are reported at estimated fair\nvalue, with unrealized gains and losses\nreported in AOCI, net of deferred income\ntaxes, in the Shareholders' equity section of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or\nlosses realized from the sale of AFS\nsecurities are determined by specific\nidentification and are included in noninterest\nincome.\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit losses are measured on an\nindividual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the US\ngovernment, are highly rated by rating\nagencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. There was no ACL on the Company\u2019s AFS\ndebt securities at September 30, 2020.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company's accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased, and if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that at the date of acquisition there is\nmore than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nOriginated Loans and Leases\n\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture or until maturity or payoff are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest method.\n\nPurchased Loans\n\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date.\n\nFair values for purchased loans are based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology that\nconsiders credit loss expectations, market\ninterest rates and other market factors such\nas liquidity from the perspective of a market\nparticipant. Loans are grouped together\naccording to similar characteristics and\ntreated in the aggregate when applying various\nvaluation techniques. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninternal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2020, purchased loans are\nevaluated upon acquisition and classified as\neither PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality, including but not limited to risk\ngrades, delinquency, nonperforming status,\nprevious troubled debt restructurings or\nbankruptcies and other qualitative factors\nthat indicate deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination.\n\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans, and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans, is amortized or accreted to Interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\ninterest-only loans and loans with revolving\nprivileges. In the event of prepayment,\nunamortized discounts or premiums are\nrecognized in Interest and fees on loans and\nleases.\nTDRs\nModifications to a borrower's debt agreement\nare considered TDRs if a concession is granted\nfor economic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower's financial difficulties that\notherwise would not be considered. TDRs are\nundertaken to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan and may take the form of\nmodifications made with the stated interest\nrate lower than the current market rate for\nnew debt with similar risk, other\nmodifications to the structure of the loan\nthat fall outside of normal underwriting\npolicies and procedures, or in certain limited\ncircumstances, forgiveness of principal or\ninterest. A restructuring that results in only\na delay in payments that is insignificant is\nnot considered an economic concession. In\naccordance with the CARES Act, Truist\nimplemented loan modification programs in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to\nprovide borrowers with flexibility with\nrespect to repayment terms. Truist payment\nrelief assistance includes forbearance,\ndeferrals, extension and re-aging programs,\nalong with certain other modification\nstrategies. The Company elected the accounting\npolicy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR\naccounting to loans modified for borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\napplies this policy to loans modified in\nresponse to COVID-19 hardships that were less\nthan 30 days past due at December 31, 2019, or\nin certain circumstances, at the time that the\nCOVID-19 loan modification program was\nimplemented, unless the loan was previously\nclassified as a TDR.\nTDRs can be classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower will be\nable to repay the loan based on the modified\nterms. In circumstances where the TDR involves\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classifies these TDRs as nonperforming.\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe decision to maintain a commercial TDR on\nperforming status is based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrower's\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation includes consideration of the\nborrower's current capacity to pay, which\namong other things may include a review of the\nborrower's current financial statements, an\nanalysis of cash flow available to pay debt\nobligations, and an evaluation of secondary\nsources of payment from the borrower and any\nguarantors. This evaluation also includes an\nevaluation of the borrower's current\nwillingness to pay, which may include a review\nof past payment history, an evaluation of the\nborrower's willingness to provide information\non a timely basis, and consideration of offers\nfrom the borrower to provide additional\ncollateral or guarantor support. The credit\nevaluation may also include review of cash\nflow projections, consideration of the\nadequacy of collateral to cover all principal\nand interest and trends indicating improving\nprofitability and collectability of\nreceivables.\n\nThe evaluation of mortgage and other consumer\nloans includes an evaluation of the client's\ndebt-to-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue and certain other client-specific\nfactors that impact the clients\u2019 ability to\nmake timely principal and interest payments on\nthe loan.\n\nTDR classification may be removed due to the\npassage of time if the loan: (1) did not\ninclude a forgiveness of principal or\ninterest, (2) has performed in accordance with\nthe modified terms (generally a minimum of six\nconsecutive months), (3) was reported as a TDR\nover a year-end reporting period, and (4)\nreflected an interest rate on the modified\nloan that was no less than a market rate at\nthe date of modification. TDR classification\nmay also be removed for an accruing loan upon\nthe occurrence of a subsequent non-\nconcessionary modification granted at market\nterms and within current underwriting\nguidelines.\nNPAs\nNPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property.\nForeclosed property consists of real estate\nand other assets acquired as a result of\nclients' loan defaults.\nTruist's policies for placing loans on\nnonperforming status conform to guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities.\nTruist classifies loans and leases as past due\nwhen the payment of principal and interest\nbased upon contractual terms is greater than\n30 days delinquent or if one payment is past\ndue. Payment deferrals granted as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic do not result in a loan\nbecoming past due.

Consumer and credit card\nloans are subject to charge-off at a specified\ndelinquency date consistent with regulatory\nguidelines.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\n\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus. Interest has been deferred on loans\nthat have been provided payment relief\nassistance in connection with the CARES Act\nthat based on management's best estimate may\nultimately prove to be uncollectible.\n\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value less\nestimated cost to sell and subsequently\ncarried at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value equals fair value\nless estimated selling costs. Any excess of\ncost over net realizable value at the time of\nforeclosure is charged to the ALLL. NPAs are\nsubject to periodic revaluations of the\ncollateral underlying impaired loans and\nforeclosed real estate. The periodic\nrevaluations are generally based on the\nappraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist's\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than six months\nold, otherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition of these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \"Note 5. Loans and\nACL.\u201d\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from or added to the loans\u2019 amortized\ncost basis to present the net amount expected\nto be collected on loans. The entire amount of\nthe ACL is available to absorb losses on any\nloan category or lending-related commitment.\nLoan or lease balances deemed to be\nuncollectible are charged off against the\nALLL. Expected recoveries of amounts\npreviously charged off are incorporated into\nthe ALLL estimate, with such amounts capped at\nthe aggregate of amounts previously charged\noff. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to\nthe Provision for credit losses, which is\nreflected in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The RUFC is recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments; commercial, consumer\nand credit card. The expected credit loss\nmodels are generally developed one level below\nthe portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans are further disaggregated by\nsimilar risk characteristics, such as business\nsector, client type, funding type, type of\ncollateral, whether loan payments are\ninterest-only and whether interest rates are\nfixed or variable. Larger loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nor that are considered collateral-dependent\nare individually evaluated. For these loans,\nthe ALLL is determined through review of data\nspecific to the borrower and related\ncollateral, if any. Such estimates may be\nbased on current loss forecasts, an evaluation\nof the fair value of the underlying collateral\nor in certain circumstances the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest as described further\nbelow. The commercial portfolio segment models\nuse a risk rating approach to estimate the\nALLL. The consumer and credit card models use\na delinquency-based approach to estimate the\nALLL. In addition to these quantitatively\ncalculated components, the ALLL includes\nqualitatively calculated components.\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic scenarios, portfolio\ncomposition and loan attributes as the primary\ninputs. Loss estimates are informed by\nhistorical loss experience adjusted for\nmacroeconomic forecasts and current and\nexpected portfolio risk characteristics.\nExpected losses are estimated through\ncontractual maturity unless the borrower has a\nright to renew that is not cancellable or it\nis reasonably expected that the loan will be\nmodified as a TDR.\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for enterprise-\nsanctioned macroeconomic scenarios, including\nthe macroeconomic forecasts for use in the ACL\nprocess. Forecasted economic conditions are\ndeveloped using third party macroeconomic\nscenarios adjusted based on management\u2019s\nexpectations over a reasonable and supportable\nforecast period of two years. Assumptions\nrevert to long term historic averages\ngradually over a one year period.\nMacroeconomic factors used in estimating the\nexpected losses vary by loan portfolio and\ninclude employment factors, estimated\ncollateral values and market indicators as\ndescribed by portfolio segment below. A\nqualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions and capture risks in the\nportfolio such as considerations with respect\nto the impact of current economic events, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain. These events\nmay include, but are not limited to, political\nconditions, legislation that may directly or\nindirectly affect the banking industry and\neconomic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which\nTruist conducts business.\n\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\n\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\n\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower's ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers' financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower's ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan's guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is reasonably\nassured. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management's   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting models are\nexpected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic scenarios and current portfolio\nattributes as inputs. The models forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the commercial\nportfolios include unemployment trends, U.S.\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates and property values.\n\nTruist's policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all nonperforming\nlending relationships and TDRs with an\noutstanding balance of $5 million or more, as\nsuch lending relationships do not typically\nshare similar risk characteristics with\nothers. Individually evaluated reserves are\nbased on current forecasts, the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest rate or the value of\ncollateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories and other types of collateral.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 13\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe majority of the ALLL related to the\nconsumer and credit card lending portfolios is\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness and sales channel. Consumer portfolio\nmodels are expected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic scenarios and current portfolio\nattributes as inputs. The models forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the consumer\nportfolios include unemployment trends, home\nprice indices and used car prices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination, and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and\nindirect other portfolios include secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used automobiles,\nboats and recreational vehicles. The student\nloan portfolio is composed of government-\nguaranteed student loans and certain private\nstudent loans originated by third parties. The\ngovernment guarantee mitigates substantially\nall of the risk related to principal and\ninterest repayment for this component of the\nportfolio. Private student loans purchased\nfrom third-party originators with credit\nenhancements partially mitigate the Company\u2019s\ncredit exposure. The credit card portfolio and\nother arrangements within the indirect other\nand residential home equity and direct\nportfolios are generally unsecured and are\nactively managed.\n\nTruist uses performing status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n\nThe ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is\nbased on analyses capturing the expected\ncredit losses and the impact of the concession\nover the remaining life of the asset.\n\nExpected recoveries for consumer and credit\ncard loans are included in the estimation of\nthe ALLL based on historical experience.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Pronouncements\n                                              \n  Standard /                    Effects on    \n  Adoption       Description    the           \n  Date                          Financial     \n                                Statements    \n  Standards                                   \n  Adopted                                     \n  During the                                  \n  Current                                     \n  Year                                        \n                                Truist        \n                                adopted this  \n                                standard      \n                                using the     \n                                modified      \n                 Replaces       retrospecti\u2026  \n                 the            approach.     \n                 incurred       The adoption  \n                 loss           of this       \n                 impairment     standard      \n                 methodology    resulted in   \n                 with an        a $3.1        \n                 expected       billion       \n                 credit loss    increase to   \n                 methodology    the ALLL and  \n                 and            a $2.1        \n                 requires       billion       \n                 considerat\u2026    decrease to   \n                 of a           Retained      \n                 broader        earnings      \n                 range of       adjusted for  \n                 information    deferred      \n                 to             taxes and     \n                 determine      other         \n                 credit loss    impacts.      \n                 estimates.

The Merger\nwas accounted for as a business combination.\nAccordingly, the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were recorded at their\nfair values as of the Merger date. The\ndetermination of fair value requires\nmanagement to make estimates about discount\nrates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are\nhighly subjective in nature and subject to\nchange. Fair value estimates related to the\nacquired assets and liabilities are subject to\nadjustment until all necessary information\nrelated to the valuation process has been\nreceived.

ALLL for PCD acquisitions and other\nactivity.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe adoption of CECL increased the ALLL $\n3.1billion. The following discussion of the\nchanges in the factors that influenced\nTruist\u2019s ACL estimate and the reasons for\nthose changes excludes the impact at adoption\nand certain other activity.\n\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 153million and\n$ 1.0billion for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020, respectively. The\nincrease for the nine month period is\nprimarily attributed to a more pessimistic\noutlook with respect to future economic\nconditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and\nspecific consideration of the risks associated\nwith exposures to certain industries,\nincluding oil and gas, hospitality, and\nlending to small businesses. The modest\nincrease for the three month period reflects\ncontinued monitoring of clients\u2019 financial\nposition and associated re-grading actions as\nwell as uncertainty related to performance\nafter the expiration of relief packages.\n\nThe consumer ALLL increased $ 15million and $\n214million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, respectively. The increase\nfor the nine month period reflects the impact\nof the more pessimistic outlook described\nabove, with the largest increases seen in the\nunsecured portfolios and the non-prime auto\nlending portfolio. The modest increase for the\nthree month period reflects the uncertainty\nrelated to the pandemic and performance after\nthe expiration of relief packages partially\noffset by the reduction in loan balances\nprimarily in residential mortgage.\n\nThe ALLL for credit card decreased $ 7million\nand increased $ 23million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2020,\nrespectively. The decrease for the quarter\nreflects lower loan balances; the year-to-date\nincrease reflects risks associated with\nCOVID-19 and a more pessimistic economic\noutlook.\n\nThe RUFC decreased $ 65million and $ 43million\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2020, respectively. The net decrease\nreflects the reduction in the utilization\nestimate for conditionally cancellable\ncommitments.\n\nTruist\u2019s ACL estimate represents management\u2019s\nbest estimate of expected credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolio,\nincluding unfunded commitments, at the balance\nsheet date. This estimate incorporates both\nquantitatively-derived output, as well as\nqualitative components that represent expected\nlosses not otherwise captured by the models.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, which management has determined to be\ntwo years, followed by a reversion to long-\nterm historical loss conditions over a one-\nyear period. These macro-economic forecasts\ninclude a number of key economic variables\nutilized in loss forecasting that include, but\nare not limited to, unemployment trends, US\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates, property values, home price indices and\nused car prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird -party baseline forecast that is\nadjusted to reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate\noutlook. Management also considered multiple\nthird-party macro-economic forecasts that\nreflected a range of possible outcomes in\norder to capture uncertainty in the economic\nenvironment caused by the pandemic. The\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nSeptember 30, 2020 included an extended GDP\nrecovery through the two-year reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period with a high\nsingle-digit unemployment rate through the\nmiddle of 2021 followed by continued\nimprovement through the remainder of the\nreasonable and supportable period.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses in\ntimes of rapidly changing macro-economic\nforecasts. As a result, management believes\nthat the qualitative component of the ACL,\nwhich incorporates management\u2019s expert\njudgment related to expected future credit\nlosses, will continue to represent a\nsignificant portion of the ACL for the\nforeseeable future. The September 30, 2020 ACL\nestimate includes qualitative adjustments to\nadjust for limitations in modeled results with\nrespect to forecasted economic conditions that\nare well outside of historic economic\nconditions used to develop the models and to\ngive consideration to the impact of government\nrelief programs, stimulus and client\naccommodations that are not directly\nconsidered in the quantitative models.\nPCD Loan Activity\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is recognized in the\nALLL on the date of acquisition using the same\nmethodology as other loans held for\ninvestment.

Adjustments to the\nreallocation of net assets to Truist's\nreporting units include updates to the\nestimated operating results, and the\nfinalization of corporate expense allocations\nbased on the various drivers that Truist\napplies in allocating such costs.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets. The TRS\ncontracts pass through interest and other cash\nflows on the reference assets to the third\nparty clients, along with exposing those\nclients to decreases in value on the assets\nand providing them with the rights to\nappreciation on the assets. The terms of the\nTRS contracts require the third parties to\npost initial margin collateral, as well as\nongoing margin as the fair values of the\nunderlying reference assets change.\n\nThe Company concluded that the VIEs should be\nconsolidated because the Company has (i) the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses, and the right to receive benefits,\nthat could potentially be significant. At\nSeptember 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet reflected $ 1.5billion of assets\nand $ 40million of other liabilities of the\nVIEs. At December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet reflected $\n2.7billion of assets and $ 116million of other\nliabilities of the VIEs. Assets at September\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 include $\n1.4billion and $ 2.6billion in trading loans,\nrespectively. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird party clients via the TRS contracts.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nTRS contracts and its involvement with these\nVIEs, see \"Note 16. Derivative Financial\nInstruments.\u201d\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as for other purposes as\nrequired or permitted by law. Assets pledged\nto the FHLB and FRB are subject to applicable\nasset discounts when determining borrowing\ncapacity. The Company obtains secured\nfinancing and letters of credit from the FRB\nand FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of credit from\nthe FHLB can be used to secure various client\ndeposits, including public fund relationships.\nExcluding assets related to employee benefit\nplans, the majority of the agreements\ngoverning the pledged assets do not permit the\nother party to sell or repledge the\ncollateral. Additional assets were pledged to\nthe FRB of Richmond in the first quarter of\n2020 following the Merger.

The matters range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with multiple class members\nand can involve claims for substantial\namounts. Investigations involve both formal\nand informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThese legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration or investigation\nand may consist of a variety of claims,\nincluding common law tort and contract claims\nand statutory antitrust, securities and\nconsumer protection claims, and the ultimate\nresolution of any proceedings is uncertain and\ninherently difficult to predict. It is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters, if unfavorable, may be material to\nthe consolidated financial position,\nconsolidated results of operations, or\nconsolidated cash flows of Truist.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP\nfor contingencies, Truist establishes accruals\nfor legal matters when potential losses\nassociated with the actions become probable\nand the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. There is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the amounts that Truist\nhas currently accrued. On a quarterly basis,\nTruist evaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings to assess litigation accruals and\nadjust such accruals upwards or downward, as\nappropriate, based on management\u2019s best\njudgment after consultation with counsel and\nothers, as warranted.\n\nThe Company\u2019s estimate of reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, ranges\nfrom zeroto approximately $ 200million as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. This estimated range is\nbased upon currently available information and\ninvolves considerable judgment, given that\nclaims often include significant legal\nuncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs\nare often unspecified or overstated, discovery\nmay not have started or may not be complete,\nand material facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors. In\naddition, the matters underlying this\nestimated range will change from time to time,\nand actual losses may vary significantly from\nthis estimate. For the same reasons stated\nabove, we do not believe that an estimate of\nreasonably possible losses can be made for\ncertain matters and therefore such matters are\nnot reflected in the range provided here.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived. On October 6, 2017, the trial court\ngranted plaintiff's motion for class\ncertification and defined the class as \u201cEvery\nGeorgia citizen who had or has one or more\naccounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July\n12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least\none overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting\nfrom an ATM or debit card transaction (the\n\u201cTransaction\u201d); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees\nas a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did\nnot receive a refund of those Fees\u201d and the\ngranting of a certified class was affirmed on\nappeal.

participants, with a three level\nmeasurement hierarchy:\n\n\u2022 Level 1: Quoted prices for identical\ninstruments in active markets\n\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar\ninstruments in active markets; quoted prices\nfor identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active; and model-derived\nvaluations in which all significant inputs are\nobservable in active markets\n\n\u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation\ntechniques in which one or more significant\ninputs are unobservable\nThe following tables present fair value\ninformation for assets and

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\" for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, as a result\nof a change in control of the funds\u2019 manager,\nthe Company deconsolidated certain SBIC funds\nfor which it had previously concluded that it\nwas the primary beneficiary. Following the\ndeconsolidation, the investments in SBIC funds\nare valued based on net asset value per unit,\nas provided by the fund manager as a practical\nexpedient, which approximates the fair value,\nand have not been classified in the fair value\nhierarchy. The SBIC funds in which the Company\ninvests primarily focus on equity and\nsubordinated debt investments in privately-\nheld middle market companies. The majority of\nthese VIE investments are not redeemable and\ndistributions are received as the underlying\nassets of the funds liquidate. The timing of\ndistributions, which are expected to occur on\nvarious dates through 2030, is uncertain and\ndependent on various events such as\nrecapitalizations, refinance transactions and\nownership changes among others. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, restrictions on the\nability to sell the investments include, but\nare not limited to, consent of a majority\nmember or general partner approval for\ntransfer of ownership. These investments are\nspread over numerous privately-held middle\nmarket companies, and thus the sensitivity to\na change in fair value for any single\ninvestment is limited.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

business, the Company enters into\ncontracts that are, in form or substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, credit\ndefault swaps, risk participations and TRS.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nThe Company has entered into TRS contracts on\nloans. To mitigate its credit risk, the\nCompany typically receives initial margin from\nthe counterparty upon entering into the TRS\nand variation margin if the fair value of the\nunderlying reference assets deteriorates. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s TRS\ncontracts, see \"Note 14. Commitments and\nContingencies.\u201d\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe dealer experiences a loss on the\nderivative, such as an interest rate swap, due\nto a failure to pay by the client, on that\nderivative. The Company manages its payment\nrisk on its risk participations by monitoring\nthe creditworthiness of the underlying client\nthrough the normal credit review process that\nthe Company would have performed had it\nentered into a derivative directly with the\nobligors. At September 30, 2020, the remaining\nterms on these risk participations ranged from\nless than one year to 10 years. The potential\nfuture exposure represents the Company\u2019s\nmaximum estimated exposure to written risk\nparticipations, as measured by projecting a\nmaximum value of the guaranteed derivative\ninstruments based on scenario simulations and\nassuming 100% default by all obligors on the\nmaximum value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

It should\nbe read in conjunction with the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in this\nForm 10-Q, other information contained in this\ndocument, as well as information contained in\nthe December 31, 2019 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Government Response to COVID-19             \n                                              \nCongress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and\nfederal financial regulatory agencies, as well\nas state legislatures and officials, have\ntaken actions to mitigate disruptions to\neconomic activity and financial stability\nresulting from COVID-19 and may continue to\nevolve such approaches and requirements in\nways that further impact the business of the\nCompany. The descriptions below summarize\ncertain significant government actions taken\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The\ndescriptions are qualified in their entirety\nby reference to the particular statutory or\nregulatory provisions or government programs\nsummarized.\n                                              \n  The CARES Act                               \n                                              \nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27,\n2020 and subsequently has been amended several\ntimes. Among other provisions the CARES Act\nincludes funding for the Small Business\nAdministration to expand lending, relief from\ncertain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow\nCOVID-19-related loan modifications to not be\ncategorized as troubled debt restructurings\nand a range of incentives to encourage\ndeferment, forbearance or modification of\nloans. One of the key CARES Act programs is\nthe PPP, which temporarily expands the Small\nBusiness Administration\u2019s business loan\nguarantee program through August 8, 2020. PPP\nloans are available to a broader range of\nentities than ordinary Small Business\nAdministration loans, require deferral of\nprincipal and interest repayment, and the loan\nmay be forgiven in an amount equal to payroll\ncosts and certain other expenses during either\nan eight-week or 24-week covered period.\n\nThe CARES Act contains additional protections\nfor homeowners and renters of properties with\nfederally backed mortgages, including a 60-day\nmoratorium on the initiation of foreclosure\nproceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a\n120-day moratorium on initiating eviction\nproceedings effective March 27, 2020.\nBorrowers of federally backed mortgages have\nthe right under the CARES Act to request up to\n360 days of forbearance on their mortgage\npayments if they experience financial hardship\ndirectly or indirectly due to the coronavirus-\nrelated public health emergency. FNMA, FHLMC,\nFHA and VA have extended their moratorium on\nforeclosures and evictions for single-family\nfederally backed mortgages until at least\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nAlso pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S.\nTreasury has the authority to provide loans,\nguarantees and other investments in support of\neligible businesses, states and municipalities\naffected by the economic effects of COVID-19.\nSome of these funds have been used to support\nthe several FRB programs and facilities\ndescribed below or additional programs or\nfacilities that are established by the FRB\nunder its Section 13(3) authority and meeting\ncertain criteria.\n                                              \n  FRB Actions                                 \n                                              \nThe FRB has taken a range of actions to\nsupport the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses. For example, on March 15, 2020,\nthe FRB reduced the target range for the\nfederal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced\nthat it would increase its holdings of U.S.\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and begin purchasing agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB\nhas also encouraged depository institutions to\nborrow from the discount window and has\nlowered the primary credit rate for such\nborrowing by 150 basis points while extending\nthe term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve\nrequirements have been reduced to zero as of\nMarch 26, 2020.\n\nIn addition, the FRB has established, or has\ntaken steps to establish, a range of\nfacilities and programs to support the U.S.\neconomy and U.S. marketplace participants in\nresponse to economic disruptions associated\nwith COVID-19. Through these facilities and\nprograms, the FRB, relying on its authority\nunder Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve\nAct, has taken steps to directly or indirectly\npurchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S.\ncompanies, financial institutions,\nmunicipalities and other market participants.\n\nFRB facilities and programs established, or in\nthe process of being established, include:\n\n\u2022 a PPP Liquidity Facility to provide\nfinancing related to PPP loans made by banks;\n\n\u2022 three Main Street Loan Facilities to\npurchase loan participations, under specified\nconditions, from banks lending to small and\nmedium sized U.S. businesses;\n\n\u2022 a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide\nliquidity to primary dealers through a secured\nlending facility;\n\n\u2022 a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to\npurchase the commercial paper of certain U.S.\nissuers;\n\n46 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\u2022 a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility\nto purchase corporate bonds directly from, or\nmake loans directly to, eligible participants;\n\n\u2022 a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility\nto purchase corporate bonds trading in\nsecondary markets, including from exchange-\ntraded funds, that were issued by eligible\nparticipants;\n\n\u2022 a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility\nto make loans secured by asset-backed\nsecurities;\n\n\u2022 a Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase\nbonds directly from U.S. state, city and\ncounty issuers; and\n\n\u2022 a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility to purchase certain assets from, or\nmake loans to, financial institutions\nproviding financing to eligible money market\nmutual funds.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Considerations                   \n                                              \nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and the stability of\nthe financial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and creditors.\nTruist is subject to banking laws and\nregulations and various other laws and\nregulations, which affect the operations and\nmanagement of Truist and its ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. Refer\nto Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2019 for additional\ndisclosures with respect to significant laws\nand regulations affecting Truist.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize updates since\nthe filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 to state\nand federal laws to, which Truist is subject.\nThese descriptions do not summarize all\npossible or proposed changes in current laws\nor regulations and are not intended to be a\nsubstitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer and CCAR              \n                                              \nThe FRB has adopted a final rule that\nintegrates its annual capital planning and\nstress testing requirements with existing\nregulatory capital requirements. For risk-\nbased capital requirements, the stress capital\nbuffer replaces the capital conservation\nbuffer, which was 2.5% through September 30,\n2020. Under the final rule, beginning in the\n2020 CCAR cycle, the FRB will notify Truist of\nits SCB requirements, which is equal to the\ngreater of (i) the difference between its\nstarting and minimum projected CET1 capital\nratios under the severely adverse scenario in\nthe supervisory stress test, plus the sum of\nthe dollar amount of Truist\u2019s planned common\nstock dividends for each of the fourth through\nseventh quarters of the planning horizon as a\npercentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii)\n2.5%.\n\nThe final rule also makes related changes to\nthe capital planning and stress testing\nprocess. Among other changes, the revised\ncapital plan rule eliminates the assumption\nthat Truist\u2019s balance sheet assets would\nincrease over the planning horizon. In\naddition, provided that Truist is otherwise in\ncompliance with automatic restrictions on\ndistributions under the FRB\u2019s capital rules,\nTruist will no longer be required to seek\nprior approval to make capital distributions\nin excess of those included in its capital\nplan.\n\nThe FRB assigned Truist a SCB of 2.7%, which\nis effective from October 1, 2020 through\nSeptember 30, 2021. Consistent with the FRB\u2019s\nmandate across the industry, Truist will\nupdate and resubmit its capital plan in early\nNovember 2020 to reflect changes in financial\nmarkets and the macroeconomic outlook, and the\nFRB will conduct additional analysis each\nquarter to determine if adjustments to this\nresponse are appropriate.\n\nThe FRB also took several actions following\nits stress tests in light of the uncertainty\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically,\nfor the third and fourth quarter of 2020, the\nFRB is requiring certain large banking\norganizations, including Truist, to suspend\nshare repurchases, cap common dividends per\nshare to the amount paid in the second\nquarter, and further limit dividends according\nto a formula based on recent income. The FRB\nis also requiring banks to re-evaluate their\nlonger-term capital plans.\n\nRevisions to Definition of Eligible Retained\nIncome\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final\nrule altering the definition of eligible\nretained income in their respective capital\nrules. Under the new rule, eligible retained\nincome is the greater of a firm\u2019s (i) net\nincome for the four preceding calendar\nquarters, net of any distributions and\nassociated tax effects not already reflected\nin net income, and (ii) average net income\nover the preceding four quarters. This\ndefinition applies with respect to all of\nTruist\u2019s capital requirements.\n                                              \n  Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology  \n                                              \nThe U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final\nrule that permits banking organizations that\nimplement CECL before the end of 2020 to elect\nto follow the three-year transition available\nunder the prior rule or a new five-year\ntransition to phase in the effects of CECL on\nregulatory capital. Under the five-year\ntransition, the banking organization would\ndefer for two years 100% of the day-one effect\nof adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative\nincrease in the allowance for credit losses\nsince adoption of CECL. Following the first\ntwo years, the electing organization will\nphase out the aggregate capital effects over\nthe next three years consistent with the\ntransition in the original three-year\ntransition rule. Truist has elected to use the\nfive-year transition to phase in the impacts\nof CECL on regulatory capital.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\n                                              \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                \n                                              \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB\nhas adopted an interim final rule that\ntemporarily changes the supplementary leverage\nratio to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the\ncalculation of a firm\u2019s leverage exposure. The\ninterim final rule applies to BHCs, became\neffective April 1, 2020 and will remain in\neffect through March 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Loan modifications                          \n                                              \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, banking\nregulators have encouraged financial\ninstitutions to support borrowers impacted by\nCOVID-19. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for Truist\u2019s policy related to\nCOVID-19 loan modifications.\n                                              \n  CARES Act                                   \n                                              \nIn addition to authorizing several programs to\nprovide loans, guarantees and other\ninvestments in support of eligible\norganizations, states and municipalities\naffected by the economic effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act also includes\nseveral measures that temporarily adjust\nexisting laws or regulations. These include\nproviding the FDIC with additional authority\nto guarantee the deposits of solvent insured\ndepository institutions held in noninterest-\nbearing business transaction accounts to a\nmaximum amount specified by the FDIC,\nreinstating the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity\nGuarantee Authority to guarantee debt\nobligations of solvent insured depository\ninstitutions or depository institution holding\ncompanies, and temporarily allowing the\nTreasury to fully guarantee money market\nmutual funds. The CARES Act also provides\nfinancial institutions with the option to\nsuspend certain GAAP requirements for\ncoronavirus-related loan modifications that\nwould otherwise constitute troubled debt\nrestructurings and further requires the\nfederal banking agencies to defer to financial\ninstitutions\u2019 determinations in making such\nsuspensions. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for Truist\u2019s policy related to\nCOVID-19 loan modifications.\n                                              \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nIn June 2020, the five regulatory agencies\ncharged with implementing the Volcker Rule\nfinalized amendments to the Volcker Rule\u2019s\nrestrictions on ownership interests in and\nrelationships with covered funds. Among other\nthings, these amendments permit banking\nentities to have relationships with and offer\nadditional financial services to additional\ntypes of funds and investment vehicles. These\nrequirements are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on Truist's consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations or\ncash flows.\n                                              \n  NSFR Rule                                   \n                                              \nThe U.S. banking agencies have finalized a\nrule to implement the NSFR in the United\nStates. The NSFR rule requires each of Truist\nand Truist Bank to maintain an amount of\navailable stable funding, which is a weighted\nmeasure of a company\u2019s funding sources over a\none-year time horizon, calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to the company\u2019s\nequity and liabilities based on their expected\nstability, that is no less than the amount of\nrequired stable funding, which is calculated\nby applying standardized weightings to assets,\nderivatives exposures and certain other items\nbased on their liquidity characteristics. As a\nCategory III banking organization, Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to an NSFR requirement\nequal to 85% of the full requirement. These\nrequirements will become effective as of July\n1, 2021.\n\n48 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nOverview of Significant Events and Financial\nResults\n\nRecent Events\n\nEffective December 6, 2019, the Company\ncompleted the Merger.

On a diluted per common\nshare basis, earnings for the third quarter of\n2020 were $0.79, a decrease of $0.16 compared\nto the third quarter of 2019. Truist's results\nof operations for the third quarter of 2020\nproduced an annualized return on average\nassets of 0.91% and an annualized return on\naverage common shareholders' equity of 6.87%\ncompared to prior year returns of 1.41% and\n10.04%, respectively. Results for the third\nquarter of 2020 included merger-related and\nrestructuring charges of $236 million ($181\nmillion after-tax), incremental operating\nexpenses related to the Merger of $152 million\n($115 million after-tax), securities gains of\n$104 million ($80 million after-tax) and a\ncharitable contribution of $50 million ($38\nmillion after-tax). Results for the third\nquarter of 2019 included $34 million ($26\nmillion after-tax) of merger-related and\nrestructuring charges, and $52 million ($40\nmillion after-tax) of incremental operating\nexpenses related to the Merger and an after-\ntax reduction in net income available to\ncommon shareholders of $46 million from the\nredemption of preferred stock.\n\nTruist\u2019s revenue for the third quarter of 2020\nwas $5.6 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was\nalso $5.6 billion for the third quarter of\n2020, an increase of $2.6 billion compared to\nthe same period in 2019, reflecting an\nincrease of $1.7 billion in TE net interest\nincome and an increase of $907 million in\nnoninterest income. The increase in revenue\nwas primarily due to the Merger.\n\nNIM was 3.10% for the third quarter of 2020,\ndown 27 basis points compared to the prior\nyear. Average earning assets increased $232.0\nbillion, as average loans and leases increased\n$163.6 billion and average securities\nincreased $30.9 billion. In addition, average\nother earning assets increased $34.0 billion\nprimarily due to higher interest bearing\nbalances at the Federal Reserve. Average\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased $155.0\nbillion and noninterest-bearing deposits\nincreased $71.5 billion. The annualized TE\nyield on the total loan portfolio for the\nthird quarter of 2020 was 4.04%, down 94 basis\npoints compared to the prior year. The\nannualized TE yield on the average securities\nportfolio was 1.97%, down 63 basis points\ncompared to the prior year. The average costs\nof interest-bearing liabilities was 0.35%,\ndown 112 basis points compared to the prior\nyear.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $421\nmillion compared to $117 million for the third\nquarter of 2019. The increase in the provision\nfor credit losses reflects a modest build to\nthe allowance for credit losses primarily due\nto monitoring of clients\u2019 financial position\nand associated re-grading actions, as well as\nuncertainty related to performance after the\nexpiration of relief packages and COVID-19,\nthe impact of the Merger, and the effect of\napplying the CECL methodology in the current\nquarter compared to the incurred methodology\nin the prior year. Net charge-offs for the\nthird quarter of 2020 totaled $326 million\ncompared to $153 million in the prior year.\nHigher net charge-offs also contributed to the\nincrease in the provision for credit losses\nand primarily reflect increases as a result of\nthe Merger. The net charge-off rate for the\ncurrent quarter of 0.42% of average loans and\nleases was up one basis point compared to the\nthird quarter of 2019.\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of\n2020 increased $907 million compared to the\nearlier quarter. The current quarter includes\n$104 million of securities gains. Excluding\nthe securities gains, noninterest income\nincreased $803 million, with nearly all\ncategories of noninterest income being\nimpacted by the Merger. In addition to these\nimpacts, insurance income increased $31\nmillion due to strong production and premium\ngrowth and residential mortgage banking income\nwas up due to strong production and refinance\nactivity driven by the lower rate environment,\npartially offset by lower valuations of\nmortgage servicing rights. Service charges on\ndeposits partially rebounded during the third\nquarter due to increased overdraft incident\nrates and reduced refunds and waivers to\naccommodate clients impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of\n2020 was up $1.9 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter. Merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and other incremental\noperating expenses related to the Merger\nincreased $202 million and $100 million,\nrespectively. In addition, the current quarter\nwas impacted by a $50 million charitable\ncontribution to the Truist Charitable Fund.\nExcluding the items mentioned above and the\nimpact of an increase of $141 million of\namortization expense for intangibles, adjusted\nnoninterest expense was up $1.4 billion\nprimarily reflecting the impact of the Merger.\nIn addition to the impacts of the Merger,\noperating costs were elevated due to COVID-19,\nwhich resulted in an additional $26 million of\nexpenses compared to the third quarter of\n2019. This was primarily related to net\noccupancy costs for enhanced cleaning.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $255\nmillion for the third quarter of 2020,\ncompared to $218 million for the earlier\nquarter. This produced an effective tax rate\nfor the third quarter of 2020 of 18.3%,\ncompared to 20.8% for the earlier quarter. The\nlower effective tax rate is primarily due to\nhigher favorable permanent tax items and\nincome tax credits earned in the current year.\n\nTruist's total assets at September 30, 2020\nwere $499.2 billion, an increase of $26.1\nbillion compared to December 31, 2019. The\nincrease in total assets was primarily driven\nby an increase of $17.9 billion in interest-\nbearing deposits with banks reflecting higher\nbalances held at the Federal Reserve, an\nincrease of $11.4 billion in AFS securities\nand a $3.9 billion increase in total loans and\nleases. These increases were partially offset\nby a $4.3 billion increase in the ALLL and a\n$1.1 billion decrease in trading assets.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\nTotal deposits at September 30, 2020 were\n$370.7 billion, an increase of $36.0 billion\ncompared to December 31, 2019. The growth in\ndeposits reflects solid growth in all non-time\ndeposit products due to a flight to quality\nand the government stimulus programs,\npartially offset by a decline in time deposits\nprimarily due to maturities of wholesale\nnegotiable certificates of deposit and higher-\ncost personal and business accounts.\n\nAsset quality ratios were relatively stable at\nSeptember 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020,\nnonperforming assets were 0.26% of total\nassets. The allowance for loan and lease loss\ncoverage ratio was 5.22x nonperforming loans\nand leases held for investment, compared to\n3.41x at December 31, 2019. The higher\ncoverage ratio reflects the CECL adoption\nbuild, as well as a reserve build in 2020 in\nconnection with COVID-19 and the economic\ndownturn.\n\nTruist maintained strong capital and\nliquidity. As of September 30, 2020, the CET1\nratio was 10.0% and the average LCR was 117%.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30,\n2020, Truist issued $3.5 billion of preferred\nstock and redeemed $500 million of Series K\npreferred stock. The Company also issued $6.5\nbillion of senior and subordinated long-term\ndebt. Truist declared common dividends of\n$0.450 per share during the third quarter of\n2020.

The increase in average earning\nassets reflects a $163.6 billion increase in\naverage total loans and leases and a $30.9\nbillion increase in average securities.\nAverage other earning assets increased $34.0\nbillion primarily due to higher interest-\nearning balances at the Federal Reserve.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased\n$155.0 billion compared to the earlier\nquarter. Average interest-bearing deposits\nincreased $138.8 billion, average long-term\ndebt increased $18.3 billion and average\nshort-term borrowings decreased $2.1 billion.\nThe significant increases in earning assets\nand liabilities are primarily due to the\nMerger, as well as impacts from the COVID-19\npandemic and the resulting government stimulus\nprograms.\n\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nthird quarter of 2020 was 4.04%, down 94 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter,\nreflecting the impact of rate decreases and\ndeferred interest for loans granted an\naccommodation in connection with COVID-19,\npartially offset by purchase accounting\naccretion from merged loans. The yield on the\naverage securities portfolio was 1.97%, down\n63 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter primarily due to lower yields on new\npurchases and higher premium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.10%,\ndown 57 basis points compared to the earlier\nquarter, and the average cost of interest-\nbearing deposits was 0.15%, down 84 basis\npoints compared to the earlier quarter.

The average rate on long-term\ndebt was 1.48%, down 194 basis points compared\nto the earlier quarter. The lower rates on\ninterest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower\nrate environment. The lower rates on long-term\ndebt also reflect the amortization of the fair\nvalue mark on the assumed debt and the\nissuance of new long-term debt.\n\nNine Months of 2020 compared to Nine Months of\n2019\n\nThe net interest margin was 3.26% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020, down 17 basis\npoints compared to the earlier period. Average\nearning assets increased $231.3 billion, which\nprimarily reflects a $165.8 billion increase\nin average total loans and leases, a $32.0\nbillion increase in average other earning\nassets, a $29.6 billion increase in average\nsecurities and a $3.8 billion increase in\ninterest earning trading assets. The increase\nin average other earning assets primarily\nreflects higher interest-bearing balances at\nthe Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing\nliabilities increased $169.3 billion. Average\ninterest-bearing deposits increased $140.7\nbillion, average long-term debt increased\n$24.6 billion and average short-term\nborrowings increased $3.9 billion. The\nsignificant increases in earnings assets and\nliabilities are primarily due to the Merger,\nas well as impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic\nand the resulting government stimulus\nprograms.\n\nThe yield on the total loan portfolio for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2020 was\n4.39%, down 64 basis points compared to the\nearlier period, reflecting the impact of rate\ndecreases and deferred interest for loans\ngranted an accommodation in connection with\nCOVID-19, partially offset by purchase\naccounting accretion from merged loans. The\nyield on the average securities portfolio for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2020 was\n2.31%, down 30 basis points compared to the\nearlier period primarily due lower yields on\nnew purchases and higher premium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.27%,\ndown 39 basis points compared to the earlier\nperiod.

The average rate on long-term debt was\n1.78%, down 157 basis points compared to the\nearlier period. The lower rates on interest-\nbearing liabilities reflect the lower rate\nenvironment. The lower rates on long-term debt\nalso reflect the amortization of the fair\nvalue mark on the assumed debt and the\nissuance of new long-term debt.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt\nwere $2.7 billion, $26 million and $238\nmillion, respectively. The remaining\nunamortized fair value mark on loans and\nleases consists of $1.2 billion for commercial\nloans and leases and $1.5 billion for consumer\nloans and leases. These amounts will be\nrecognized over the remaining contractual\nlives of the underlying instruments or as\nprepayments occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 53\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

In\naddition to the impacts from the Merger,\ninsurance income increased $85 million due to\nstrong production and premium growth and\nresidential mortgage banking income was up due\nto strong production and refinance activity\ndriven by the lower rate environment,\npartially offset by lower valuations of the\nmortgage servicing rights. Service charges on\ndeposits were up despite reduced overdraft\nincident rates and refunds and waivers to\nsupport clients impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. Additionally, investment banking and\ntrading income was up, but was negatively\nimpacted by credit valuation adjustments on\nthe derivatives portfolio primarily related to\nthe decline in interest rates and widening of\ncredit spreads. Other income decreased $30\nmillion primarily due to less income from\nprivate equity investments.\n                                              \n  Noninterest Expense                         \n                                              \nThe following table provides a breakdown of\nTruist's noninterest expense:\n                                              \n                    %                    %    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2014                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \nThird Quarter 2020 compared to Third Quarter\n2019\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of\n2020 was up $1.9 billion compared to the\nearlier quarter.

Noninterest expense\nincreased $847 million primarily due to the\nloss on early extinguishment of long-term\ndebt, operating expenses related to the\nMerger, and higher Merger-related charges in\nthe current year. The benefit for income taxes\nincreased $222 million primarily due to a\nhigher pre-tax loss.\n\n60 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Analysis of Financial Condition             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Investment Activities                       \n                                              \nThe securities portfolio totaled $86.1 billion\nat September 30, 2020, compared to $74.7\nbillion at December 31, 2019.

loans that received\na deferral under the CARES Act is generally\nfrozen during the deferral period.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nOverall asset quality ratios were relatively\nstable at September 30, 2020 compared to June\n30, 2020.\n\nNonperforming assets totaled $1.3 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020, up $62 million compared to\nJune 30, 2020. Nonperforming loans and leases\nheld for investment represented 0.37% of loans\nand leases held for investment, up 2 basis\npoints compared to June 30, 2020. The increase\nin nonperforming loans held for investment is\nprimarily in commercial and industrial loans,\nwhich was partially offset by a decline in\ncommercial leases due to a charge-off on a PCD\nloan related to the implementation of CECL.\nWithin the consumer portfolio, indirect\nautomobile nonaccrual loans declined as some\nstates lifted the moratorium on repossessions.\nPerforming TDRs were up $110 million during\nthe third quarter primarily in residential\nmortgage loans.\n\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still\naccruing totaled $1.2 billion at September 30,\n2020, up $125 million compared to the prior\nquarter. The increase was primarily in\ngovernment guaranteed student loans as\nforbearance programs in connection with the\nCARES Act have ended. In addition, residential\nmortgage loans 90 days or more past due\nincreased primarily due to the repurchase of\ndelinquent government guaranteed loans. The\nratio of loans 90 days or more past due and\nstill accruing as a percentage of loans and\nleases was 0.39% at September 30, 2020, up\nfive basis points from the prior quarter.\nExcluding government guaranteed loans, the\nratio of loans 90 days or more past due and\nstill accruing as a percentage of loans and\nleases was 0.03% at September 30, 2020, down\none basis point from June 30, 2020.\n\nLoans 30-89 days past due and still accruing\ntotaled $2.1 billion at September 30, 2020, up\n$247 million compared to the prior quarter.\nStudent loans 30-89 days past due increased\n$224 million, which almost entirely relates to\ngovernment guaranteed loans as forbearance\nprograms in connection with the CARES Act have\nended. In addition, residential mortgage loans\nand indirect automobile loans increased, while\ncommercial and industrial loans declined. The\nratio of loans 30-89 days past due and still\naccruing as a percentage of loans and leases\nwas 0.70% at September 30, 2020, up 10 basis\npoints from the prior quarter.\n\nProblem loans include NPLs and loans that are\n90 days or more past due and still accruing as\ndisclosed in Table 11. In addition, for the\ncommercial portfolio segment, loans that are\nrated special mention or substandard\nperforming are closely monitored by management\nas potential problem loans.

As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES\nAct, Truist implemented loan modification\nprograms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nin order to provide borrowers with flexibility\nwith respect to repayment terms. These loan\nmodifications are generally not considered\nTDRs at the time of modification to the extent\nthat the borrower was impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and was less than 30 days past due at\nDecember 31, 2019, or in certain\ncircumstances, at the time that the COVID-19\nloan modification program was implemented,\nunless the loan was previously classified as a\nTDR.\n\nTDRs identified by SunTrust prior to the\nMerger date are not included in Truist's TDR\ndisclosure because all such loans were\nrecorded at fair value and a new accounting\nbasis was established as of the Merger date.\nSubsequent modifications will be evaluated for\npotential treatment as TDRs in accordance with\nTruist's accounting policies.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of\nperforming TDR

at December 31,\n2019. The increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses was primarily due to the adoption of\nCECL. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a\n$3.1 billion increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses, including $2.8 billion that was\ncharged to retained earnings before tax, and\n$378 million related to the gross up for PCD\nloans. The remaining increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses primarily reflects\ndeteriorated economic conditions. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, the allowance for loan and\nlease losses was 1.91% of loans and leases\nheld for investment. The allowance for credit\nlosses includes $5.9 billion for loans and\nleases and $366 million for the reserve for\nunfunded commitments.\n\nAt September 30, 2020, the allowance for loan\nand lease losses was 5.22 times nonperforming\nloans and leases held for investment, compared\nto 5.24 times at June 30, 2020. At September\n30, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses was 4.52 times annualized net charge-\noffs, compared to 4.49 times at June 30, 2020.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNet charge-offs during the third quarter\ntotaled $326 million, up $10 million compared\nto the prior quarter. As a percentage of\naverage loans and leases, annualized net\ncharge-offs were 0.42%, up three basis points\ncompared to the prior quarter. Current quarter\nnet charge-offs includes $97 million of\ncharge-offs related to the implementation of\nCECL, which required a gross-up of loan\ncarrying values in connection with the\nestablishment of an allowance on PCD loans.\nManagement performed a comprehensive review of\nPCD assets during the third quarter and\nconcluded in certain situations that a charge-\noff was required. Excluding these additional\ncharge-offs, net charge-offs would have been\nan annualized 0.29% of average loans and\nleases for the third quarter of 2020, down 10\nbasis points compared to the prior quarter.\n\nThe following table presents an allocation of\nthe ALLL.

Truist also\nreceives notification when the first lien\nholder, whether Truist or another financial\ninstitution, has initiated foreclosure\nproceedings against the borrower. When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nAs a result, using migration assumptions that\nare based on historical experience and\nadjusted for current trends, Truist estimates\nthe volume of second lien positions where the\nfirst lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL\nto reflect the increased risk of loss on these\ncredits. Finally, Truist also provides\nadditional reserves for second lien positions\nwhen the estimated combined current loan to\nvalue ratio for the credit exceeds 100%.

These borrowing\nsources were replaced with strong deposit\ngrowth.\n\nAverage short-term borrowings were $6.2\nbillion, or 1.5% of total funding for the\nthird quarter 2020, as compared to $8.3\nbillion, or 4.3% for the prior year quarter as\nthese funding sources were largely replaced by\nthe strong deposit growth.\n\nLong-term debt provides funding and, to a\nlesser extent, regulatory capital, and\nprimarily consists of senior and subordinated\nnotes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-\nterm debt totaled $41.0 billion at September\n30, 2020, a decrease of $331 million compared\nto December 31, 2019. During 2020, the Company\nissued $4.8 billion of senior notes with\ninterest rates from 1.125% to 1.95% maturing\nin 2023 to 2030, $500 million in floating rate\nsenior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion\nof subordinated notes with an interest rate of\n2.25% maturing in 2030. These issuances were\npartially offset by the redemption of $3.7\nbillion of senior notes during 2020 and a\ndecrease of $3.3 billion in long-term FHLB\nadvances. The average cost of long-term debt\nwas 1.78% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2020, down 157 basis points compared to\nthe same period in 2019. FHLB advances\nrepresented 2.1% of total outstanding long-\nterm debt at September 30, 2020, compared to\n10.0% at December 31, 2019. Truist entered\ninto $20 billion of FHLB advances during the\nfirst quarter of 2020 to build liquidity and\nensure the Company was able to meet the\nfunding needs of its clients. As market\nconditions stabilized and deposits increased,\nthese advances were redeemed during the second\nquarter of 2020 and the Company recognized a\nloss of $235 million on the early\nextinguishment of debt. The redemption of\nthese advances will improve net interest\nincome, the net interest margin and the\nleverage ratios.\n\nIn October 2020, Truist redeemed $300 million\nof floating rate senior bank notes due October\n2021 and $600 million fixed-to-floating rate\nsenior bank notes due October 2021.\n\nShareholders' Equity\n\nTotal shareholders' equity was $70.0 billion\nat September 30, 2020, an increase of $3.4\nbillion from December 31, 2019. This increase\nincludes the issuance of $3.5 billion of\npreferred stock during the year, $3.2 billion\nin net income available to common shareholders\nand an increase of $1.3 billion in AOCI, which\nwas partially offset by $2.1 billion related\nto the adoption of CECL and $2.0 billion for\ncommon and preferred dividends. In addition,\nTruist redeemed $500 million of its Series K\npreferred stock during 2020. Truist's book\nvalue per common share at September 30, 2020\nwas $45.86, compared to $45.66 at December 31,\n2019.\n\nRefer to \"Note 10.

Effective risk management involves\nappropriately managing risk to optimize risk\nand return, and operate in a safe and sound\nmanner while ensuring compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations. The Company\u2019s\nrisk management framework is designed to\nensure that business strategies and objectives\nare executed in alignment with its risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports transparency and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate's adherence to, and successful\nimplementation of, Truist's risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany's compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the risks\nassociated with integrating heritage BB&T and\nheritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive\nLeadership oversee the change management\nprogram, which is designed to ensure key\ndecisions are reviewed and that there is\nappropriate oversight of integration\nactivities.\n\nRefer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\nadditional disclosures under the section\ntitled \"Risk Management.\"\n                                              \n  Market risk management                      \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility or correlations among\nfinancial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist's strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist's most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk\nand volatility risk in Truist's BUs. Interest\nrate risk results from differences between the\ntiming of rate changes and the timing of cash\nflows associated with assets and liabilities\n(re-pricing risk); from changing rate\nrelationships among different yield curves\naffecting bank activities (basis risk); from\nchanging rate relationships across the\nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and\nfrom interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income and capital\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest rate market risk (other than       \n  trading)                                    \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk both on its assets and\non its liabilities. Since interest rate\nchanges are out of the control of any private\nsector institution, Truist actively manages\nits interest rate risk exposure through the\nstrategic repricing of its assets and\nliabilities, taking into account the volumes,\nmaturities and mix, with the goal of keeping\nnet interest margin as stable as possible.\nTruist primarily uses three methods to measure\nand monitor its interest rate risk: (i)\nsimulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist's\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes and projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas are an important assumption in\nthe interest rate risk modeling process.\nTruist applies an average deposit beta (the\nsensitivity of deposit rate changes relative\nto market rate changes) of approximately 50%\nto its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit\naccounts for determining its interest rate\nsensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing\ndeposit accounts include interest checking\naccounts, savings accounts and money market\naccounts that do not have a contractual\nmaturity. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nRate sensitivity increased compared to the\nprior periods, primarily driven by loan and\ndeposit mix changes related to the Merger and\nrecent activity, increased fixed rate funding,\nand increased noninterest-bearing deposits.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\nloss of these deposits in the future would\nreduce the asset sensitivity of Truist\u2019s\nbalance sheet as the Company would increase\ninterest-bearing funds to offset the loss of\nthis advantageous funding source.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist's interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of demand deposits and an\nassociated increase in managed rate deposits\nunder various scenarios. For purposes of this\nanalysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta\nof managed rate deposits for the replacement\nof the demand deposits at 100%.\n                                              \n  Table 22:                                   \n  Deposit                                     \n  Mix                                         \n  Sensitiv\u2026                                   \n  Analysis                                    \n                                  Results     \n                                 Assuming     \n  Linear             Base           a $10     \n  Change in      Scenario         Billion     \n  Rates                at        Decrease     \n  (bps)        September\u2026              in     \n                      (1)       Noninter\u2026     \n                                   Demand     \n                                 Deposits     \n  Up 100             3.43  %         3.02  %  \n  Up 50              2.68            2.38     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at September 30, 2020 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nIf rates increased 100 basis points, Truist\ncould absorb the loss of $82.8 billion, or\n66.6%, of noninterest-bearing deposit balances\nand replace them with managed rate deposits\nwith a beta of 100% before becoming neutral to\ninterest rate changes.\n\nTruist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on\nlonger-term projected changes in asset and\nliability values given potential changes in\ninterest rates. This measure allows Truist to\nanalyze interest rate risk that falls outside\nthe net interest income simulation period. The\nEVE model is a discounted cash flow of the\nportfolio of assets, liabilities and\nderivative instruments.

Truist has LIBOR-based\ncontracts that extend beyond 2021. To prepare\nfor the possible transition to an alternative\nreference rate, management has formed a cross-\nfunctional project team to address the LIBOR\ntransition. The project team has performed an\nassessment to identify the potential risks\nrelated to the transition from LIBOR to a new\nindex. The project team provides updates to\nmanagement and the Board.\n\nThe project team is reviewing contract\nfallback language for loans and leases and\nnoted that certain contracts will need updated\nprovisions for the transition, and the team is\ncoordinating with impacted lines of business\nto update LIBOR fallback language generally\nconsistent with the ARRC recommendation.\nTruist is continuing to evaluate the impact on\nthese contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and other related operational and\nmarket risks. Market risks associated with\nthis change are dependent on the alternative\nreference rates available and market\nconditions at transition. For a further\ndiscussion of the various risks associated\nwith the potential cessation of LIBOR and the\ntransition to alternative reference rates,\nrefer to the section titled \"Item 1A. Risk\nFactors\" in the Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. In October 2020, Truist\nbegan offering SOFR-based lending solutions to\nwholesale and retail clients. Truist expects\nSOFR to become a more commonly-used pricing\nbenchmark across the industry. Truist\ncontinues to evaluate SOFR for additional\nproduct offerings and other alternative\nreference rates as replacements for LIBOR.\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel to ensure exposures are in line with\nTruist's risk appetite.\n\nTruist is subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered trading positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements, or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for our clients, as\nwell as associated risk mitigating hedging\nactivity. The trading portfolio, measured in\nterms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-\nportfolios of covered positions: (i) credit\ntrading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii)\ninterest rate derivatives and (iv) equity\nderivatives. As a market maker across\ndifferent asset classes, Truist\u2019s trading\nportfolio also contains other sub-portfolios,\nincluding foreign exchange, loan trading, and\ncommodity derivatives; however, these\nportfolios do not generate material trading\nrisk exposures.\n\nValuation policies, procedures, and\nmethodologies exist for all covered positions.\nAdditionally, trading positions are subject to\nindependent price verification. See \"Note 16.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\u201d \"Note 15.\nFair Value Disclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical\nAccounting Policies\u201d herein for discussion of\nvaluation policies, procedures and\nmethodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$5 million, all of which were non-agency asset\nbacked securities positions. Consistent with\nthe Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company\nperforms pre-purchase due diligence on each\nsecuritization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation trading positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of September 30, 2020.\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nVaR-based measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. Prior to the\nintegration of the two institutional broker\ndealer businesses to form Truist Securities in\nthe third quarter of 2020, Truist operated two\nhistorical VaR models and the aggregate\ncompany-wide VaR across the systems was\ndetermined additively with no benefit of\ndiversification. The heritage BB&T VaR model\nwas retired following the formation of Truist\nSecurities. Following the formation of Truist\nSecurities, VaR is calculated on a\nconsolidated basis using the Truist VaR\nengine. For risk management purposes, the VaR\ncalculation is based on a historical\nsimulation approach and measures the potential\ntrading losses using a one-day holding period\nat a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For\nMarket Risk Rule purposes, the Company\ncalculates VaR using a 10-day holding period\nand a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent\nlimitations of the VaR methodology, such as\nthe assumption that past market behavior is\nindicative of future market performance, VaR\nis only one of several tools used to measure\nand manage market risk. Other tools used to\nactively manage market risk include stress\ntesting, profit and loss attribution, and stop\nloss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios. As such, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories thereby creating a portfolio\ndiversification benefit. The following table\nsummarizes certain VaR-based measures for both\nthe three and nine months ended September 30,\n2020 and 2019. The increase from the prior\nyear was mainly due to the integration of the\nheritage SunTrust trading business and the\nmarket volatility due to the COVID-19\npandemic. As illustrated in the table below,\nthe inclusion of volatility levels observed in\nMarch and April in the 12 month VaR historic\nlook back window led to a convergence between\nVaR and Stressed VaR measures.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for our\ntrading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR model backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model.\n\nThere were eight company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions during the twelve months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, primarily driven by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic which led to a sudden and\nsignificant repricing of financial markets\nduring the first and second quarter of 2020,\namid an increase in market volatility and\ndeterioration in overall market liquidity. In\naccordance with established policy and\nprocedure, all company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nFollowing such reviews, it was determined that\nthe VaR model performed in line with\nexpectations. However, the extreme moves in\nunderlying market risk factors caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic would not typically have\nbeen captured within the 1-day VaR measure.\n\nModel risk management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress testing\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company's comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, to ensure that both\ncurrent and emerging risks are captured\nappropriately. Management also utilizes stress\nanalyses to support the Company\u2019s capital\nadequacy assessment standards. See the\n\u201cCapital\u201d section of this MD&A for additional\ndiscussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist's funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position, and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities. As of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, Truist's liquid asset\nbuffer, as a percent of total assets, was\n18.6% and 16.5%, respectively.\n\nThe LCR rule directs large U.S. banking\norganizations to hold unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets sufficient to withstand\nprojected 30-day total net cash outflows, each\nas defined under the LCR rule. As of January\n1, 2020, Truist is subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist's average LCR\nwas 117% for the three months ended September\n30, 2020, well above the regulatory minimum.\n\nThe ability to raise funding at competitive\nprices is affected by the rating agencies'\nviews of the Parent Company's and Truist\nBank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and\nearnings. Management meets with the rating\nagencies on a regular basis to discuss current\noutlooks. In April 2020, DBRS revised its\noutlook for Truist and Truist Bank from\n\u201cpositive\u201d to \u201cstable,\u201d citing economic\ndeterioration related to COVID-19. DBRS\naffirmed all other ratings for Truist and\nTruist Bank. Additionally, Fitch revised its\noutlook for Truist and Truist Bank from\n\u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative,\u201d also citing pandemic-\nrelated economic deterioration. Fitch\ndowngraded Truist\u2019s subordinated debt to A-,\nand upgraded Truist\u2019s preferred stock to BBB,\nin order to align these ratings to its\nrecently revised bank rating methodology.\n\nIn July 2020, Fitch completed the\nimplementation of its revised bank rating\nmethodology. As a result, Fitch downgraded\nTruist\u2019s senior unsecured debt to A and\naffirmed Truist Bank\u2019s senior unsecured and\nsubordinated debt ratings. This rating action\ntaken by Fitch was solely a function of\nimplementing its revised bank rating\nmethodology and did not reflect a change in\nFitch\u2019s current or expected view of Truist\u2019s\nor Truist Bank\u2019s credit fundamentals.\n\nSee \"Liquidity\" section of the MD&A of the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 for additional information\nregarding credit ratings.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company's assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\naccounts receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, retirement of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt.\n\nSee \"Note 22. Parent Company Financial\nInformation\" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the Parent Company had 46\nmonths and 29 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n22 months and 20 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nTruist Bank\n\nTruist carefully manages liquidity risk at\nTruist Bank. Truist Bank's primary source of\nfunding is client deposits. Continued access\nto client deposits is highly dependent on\npublic confidence in the stability of Truist\nBank and its ability to return funds to\nclients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. At September 30, 2020, Truist\nBank had approximately $169.5 billion of\navailable secured borrowing capacity, which\nrepresents approximately 8.3 times the amount\nof one-year wholesale funding maturities. In\naddition to secured borrowing sources, Truist\nhad excess eligible cash at the Federal\nReserve Bank of $32.6 billion at September 30,\n2020.\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments,\nContingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet\nArrangements\n\nRefer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019 for\ndiscussion with respect to Truist's\nquantitative and qualitative disclosures about\nits fixed and determinable contractual\nobligations. Truist's commitments include\ninvestments in affordable housing projects\nthroughout its market area, renewable energy\ncredits, private equity funds, derivative\ncontracts to manage various financial risks,\nas well as other commitments.

Truist's\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist's risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries and provide a competitive return\nto shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios,\nwhich include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\nTotal capital are calculated based on\nregulatory guidance related to the measurement\nof capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company's capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management's overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \"well capitalized\"\nminimums. Management has implemented stressed\ncapital ratio minimum targets to evaluate\nwhether capital ratios calculated after the\neffect of alternative capital actions are\nlikely to remain above minimums specified by\nthe FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches\nof stressed minimum targets prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist's capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n           \u2026               \u2026      \u2026           \n                           \u2026                  \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                    \u2026             \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Truist targets are subject to revision\nbased on finalization of pending regulatory\nguidance and other strategic factors.\n\n(2) Truist's goal is to maintain capital\nlevels above all regulatory minimums.\n\n(3) The current capital conservation buffer of\n250 basis points was replaced by the SCB of\n270 basis points effective October 1, 2020.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, as market\nconditions evolved, Truist received Board\napproval to establish new interim operating\ntargets that provide for sufficient capital\nlevels while allowing the company to support\nclients through the economic downturn. These\ninterim operating targets will be evaluated as\neconomic conditions evolve.\n\nWhile nonrecurring events or management\ndecisions may result in the Company\ntemporarily falling below its operating\nminimum guidelines for one or more of these\nratios, it is management's intent to return to\nthese targeted operating minimums within a\nreasonable period of time through capital\nplanning. Such temporary decreases below the\noperating minimums shown above are not\nconsidered an infringement of Truist's overall\ncapital policy, provided a return above the\nminimums is forecasted to occur within a\nreasonable time period.\n\nIn August 2020, the Federal Reserve informed\nTruist of its final SCB of 270 basis points\nfor risk-based capital ratios. This buffer,\nwhich was determined based on stress testing\nresults developed by the Federal Reserve, is\n20 basis points above the Capital Conservation\nBuffer. The SCB will be effective from October\n1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, at which\npoint a revised SCB will be calculated and\nprovided to Truist. Consistent with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s mandate across the industry,\nTruist will update and resubmit its capital\nplan in early November 2020 to reflect changes\nin financial markets and the macroeconomic\noutlook. Truist\u2019s review of the results of the\n2020 CCAR supervisory stress test notes that\nthe modeled outcomes shown by the FRB differ\nfrom those calculated by the Company. Truist\nbelieves those differences are attributable to\nthe application of purchase accounting\nassociated with the Merger. Purchase\naccounting adjustments could result in a\nreduction in provision expense and an increase\nin pre-provision net revenue. These\ndifferences could result in higher capital\nratios than were reflected in the CCAR\nresults.\n\nTruist's capital ratios are presented in the\nfollowing table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  27:                                         \n  Capit\u2026                                      \n  Ratios                                      \n  -                                           \n  Truist                                      \n  Finan\u2026                                      \n  Corpo\u2026                                      \n  (Doll\u2026                                      \n  in                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  except                                      \n  per                                         \n  share                                       \n  data,                                       \n  shares                                      \n  in            Sep 30,          Dec 31,      \n  thous\u2026           2020             2019      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk-\u2026       -prelim\u2026                       \n  CET1                                        \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  to               10.0  %           9.5  %   \n  risk-\u2026                                      \n  assets                                      \n  Tier 1                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  to               12.2             10.8      \n  risk-\u2026                                      \n  assets                                      \n  Total                                       \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  to               14.6             12.6      \n  risk-\u2026                                      \n  assets                                      \n  Lever\u2026            9.6             14.7      \n  ratio                                       \n  Suppl\u2026                                      \n  lever\u2026            8.9                   NA  \n  ratio                                       \n  Non-G\u2026                                      \n  capit\u2026                                      \n  measu\u2026                                      \n  (1):                                        \n  Tangi\u2026                                      \n  common                                      \n  equity    $     26.63       $    25.93      \n  per                                         \n  common                                      \n  share                                       \n  Calcu\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  tangi\u2026                                      \n  common                                      \n  equity                                      \n  (1):                                        \n  Total                                       \n  share\u2026    $    69,973       $   66,558      \n  equity                                      \n  Less:                                       \n  Prefe\u2026          8,048            5,102      \n  stock                                       \n  Nonco\u2026            106              174      \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Goodw\u2026                                      \n  and                                         \n  intan\u2026                                      \n  asset\u2026         25,923           26,482      \n  net of                                      \n  defer\u2026                                      \n  taxes                                       \n  Tangi\u2026                                      \n  common    $    35,896       $   34,800      \n  equity                                      \n  Risk-\u2026    $   377,045       $  376,056      \n  assets                                      \n  Common                                      \n  shares                                      \n  outst\u2026       1,348,1\u2026          1,342,\u2026      \n  at end                                      \n  of                                          \n  period                                      \n                                              \n(1) Tangible common equity and related\nmeasures are non-GAAP measures that exclude\nthe impact of intangible assets, net of\ndeferred taxes, and their related\namortization. These measures are useful for\nevaluating the performance of a business\nconsistently, whether acquired or developed\ninternally. Truist's management uses these\nmeasures to assess the quality of capital and\nreturns relative to balance sheet risk. These\ncapital measures are not necessarily\ncomparable to similar capital measures that\nmay be presented by other companies.\n\nCapital ratios improved compared to year-end\n2019, due to growth in CET1 capital, partially\noffset by higher risk-weighted assets.\nTruist's capital levels remain strong compared\nto the regulatory levels for well capitalized\nbanks at September 30, 2020. Truist\u2019s other\ncapital measures also improved as Truist\nissued various capital instruments to\nstrengthen its capital position. Truist issued\n$3.5 billion of preferred stock and redeemed\n$500 million of Series K preferred stock\nduring the first nine months of 2020. In\naddition, Truist issued $1.3 billion of\nsubordinated debt. Truist declared common\ndividends of $0.450 per share during the third\nquarter of 2020.

Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations and related disclosures. The more\ncritical policies include accounting for the\nACL, determining fair value of financial\ninstruments, intangible assets, income taxes\nand costs and benefit obligations associated\nwith pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nUnderstanding Truist's accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. The critical accounting policies\nare discussed in MD&A in Truist's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Significant accounting\npolicies and changes in accounting principles\nand effects of new accounting pronouncements\nare discussed in \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d in Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Additional disclosures\nregarding the effects of new accounting\npronouncements are included in the \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation\u201d included herein. Except\nfor the items noted below, there have been no\nchanges to the significant accounting policies\nduring 2020.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nThe severe economic disruption and related\nfinancial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nhave impacted Truist\u2019s businesses. Truist\u2019s\ncommercial clients have experienced varying\nlevels of disruptions to business activity,\nsupply chains and demand for products and\nservices. Additionally, many consumer clients\nhave experienced interrupted income or\nunemployment. The pandemic also has resulted\nin continuing volatility to the global and\nU.S. financial markets, although intensive\nrelief actions by the U.S. Congress and\nregulatory agencies intended to mitigate the\nextent of adverse economic effects have\nstabilized financial markets and liquidity,\nincluding with respect to equity prices and\ncorporate credit spreads for Truist and the\nbanking sector, in comparison to earlier in\nthe year.\n\nAs a result of these considerations, Truist\nperformed a qualitative assessment of the\ngoodwill carried by the CB&W, C&CB and IH\nreporting units for impairment in the third\nquarter of 2020 to determine whether it was\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of\none or more of its reporting units was below\nits respective carrying amount as of period-\nend. In performing this assessment, Truist\nconsidered macroeconomic and market factors,\nindustry and banking sector events, a\nsensitivity analysis on management\u2019s forecast\nand assumptions, and Truist specific\nperformance indicators, including any changes\nfrom when the Merger closed in December 2019.\nDespite the adverse economic and still\nuncertain environment caused by the pandemic,\nTruist\u2019s third quarter 2020 results reflected\nprofitable performance across each of its\nreporting units; strong capital and liquidity\nlevels that have facilitated swift actions in\nsupport of clients, teammates and communities;\nand Truist\u2019s affirmation that it remains\ncommitted to achieving its Merger value\nproposition, including targeted net cost\nsaves.\n\nBased on the qualitative assessment performed,\nTruist concluded that it was not more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of one or more of\nits reporting units is below its respective\ncarrying amount as of September 30, 2020, and\ntherefore no triggering event occurred that\nrequired a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest. If economic conditions deteriorate, or\nthe pandemic\u2019s effects prolong or worsen, it\nmay be more-likely-than-not that the fair\nvalue of one or more of Truist\u2019s reporting\nunits falls below its respective carrying\namount, which would require a quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test.\n\n80 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nTruist's policy is to maintain an ACL, which\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to the\nloan and lease portfolios and off-balance\nsheet lending commitments at the balance sheet\ndate. Estimates of expected future loan and\nlease losses are determined by using\nstatistical models and management\u2019s judgement.\nThe models are designed to forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic variables to historical\nexperience. The models are generally applied\nat the portfolio level to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic data used in the models is based\non forecasted variables for the reasonable and\nsupportable period of two years. Beyond this\nforecast period the models gradually revert to\nlong-term historical loss conditions over a\none year period. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough contractual maturity, giving\nappropriate consideration to expected\nprepayments unless the borrower has a right to\nrenew that is not cancellable or it is\nreasonably expected that the loan will be\nmodified as a TDR.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions and capture risks in the\nportfolio such as considerations with respect\nto the impact of current economic events, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain. These events\nmay include, but are not limited to, political\nconditions, legislation that may directly or\nindirectly affect the banking industry and\neconomic conditions affecting specific\ngeographical areas and industries in which\nTruist conducts business.\n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics and significant loans\nthat are considered collateral-dependent are\nindividually evaluated. For these loans, the\nALLL is determined through review of data\nspecific to the borrower and related\ncollateral, if any. For TDRs, default\nexpectations and estimated prepayment speeds\nthat are specific to each of the restructured\nloan populations are incorporated in the\ndetermination of the ALLL.\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is similar to that used to\ndetermine the funded component of the ALLL and\nis measured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.

Additional risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to Truist or that management\nhas deemed to be immaterial also may\nmaterially adversely affect Truist's business,\nfinancial condition, or operating results.\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 have adversely\nimpacted, and will likely continue to\nadversely impact, the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted\nalmost all economic activity in the U.S.\nDespite the partial lifting of federal and\nstate shelter-in-place orders, some of which\nhave been renewed, it remains unknown when\nthere will be a return to normal economic\nactivity due to continued significant numbers\nof new cases, and increased economic stress\nassociated with the pandemic. Truist\ntemporarily limited access to certain offices,\nlimited branches to drive-thru and appointment\nonly, suspended some services and the majority\nof the Company\u2019s workforce is working\nremotely, which may increase cybersecurity\nrisks to the Company. Approximately 90% of\nbranches are open and unlocked, or open with\ncontrolled access. Truist continues to follow\nappropriate COVID-19 safety protocols,\nincluding proper social distancing. Commercial\nclients are experiencing varying levels of\ndisruptions or restrictions on their business\nactivity and supply chains, closures of\nfacilities or decreases in demand for their\nproducts and services. Consumer clients are\nexperiencing interrupted income or\nunemployment. Certain industries have been\nparticularly susceptible to the effects of the\npandemic, such as hotels, resorts, cruise\nlines, oil and gas companies, senior and acute\ncare facilities, restaurants, and other\nsensitive retail businesses, and Truist has\noutstanding loans to clients in these\nindustries. In addition, in March 2020,\nMoody\u2019s Investor Services downgraded its\noutlook on U.S. banks to \u201cnegative\u201d from\n\u201cstable\u201d due in part to the concerns presented\nby the pandemic. The global financial markets\nhave also experienced significant volatility.\nThe duration of this severe economic\ndisruption and its related financial impact\ncannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic have already\nresulted in an increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses, a reduction of fee income, a\nreduction of net interest margin and an\nincrease in expenses. Prolonged continuation\nof current conditions could worsen these\nimpacts and also affect the Company\u2019s capital\nand liquidity position, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair\nthe value of collateral securing loans, cause\nan outflow of deposits, cause significant\nproperty damage, in case of civil unrest or\nvandalism, influence the recognition of credit\nlosses on loans and securities and further\nincrease the allowance for credit losses,\nresult in additional lost revenue, cause\nadditional increases in expenses, result in\ngoodwill impairment charges, result in the\nimpairment of other financial and nonfinancial\nassets, and increase the Company\u2019s cost of\ncapital.\n\nIntensive government actions to mitigate the\neconomic suffering caused by the pandemic may\nnot be successful or may result in increased\npressure on the banking sector. Net interest\nmargin has been, and is likely to continue to\nbe, affected by the very low interest rate\nenvironment. The application of forbearance\nand payment deferral policies beyond any\nstatutory requirements may impact Truist\u2019s\ninterest income. Truist participated in the\nSBA\u2019s PPP as an eligible lender with the\nbenefit of a government guaranty of loans to\nsmall business clients, many of whom may face\ndifficulties even after being granted such a\nloan. The Company has registered to\nparticipate in Federal Reserve supported\nlending programs for Main Street-eligible\nborrowers as well. The Company faces increased\nrisks, in terms of credit, fraud risk and\nlitigation, in light of participation in these\nprograms. Truist has already been named in\nseveral lawsuits relating to its participation\nin the PPP.\n\nIt is possible that the pandemic and its\naftermath will lead to a prolonged economic\nslowdown or recession in the U.S. economy or\nthe world economy in general. The ultimate\nimpact on the Company\u2019s financial condition,\nresults of operation, and liquidity and\ncapital position will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\ncannot be predicted, including new information\nwhich may emerge concerning the severity of\nthe pandemic and the actions to contain or\ntreat its impact. Moreover, the effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic will heighten the other\nrisks described in the section entitled \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in the most recent Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.
