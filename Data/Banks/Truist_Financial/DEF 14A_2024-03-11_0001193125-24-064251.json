In 2023, we continued to lean into \nour purpose to inspire and build better lives \nand communities as we focused on streamlining \nour enterprise, intensifying our disciplined  \nexpense management, and accelerating franchise\nmomentum. This transformative work included   \nsharpening our strategic focus on our core    \nbusinesses and risk-management systems as well\nas continuing to strengthen our capital       \nposition. We took swift and meaningful actions\nto simplify our organization and implemented a\ncost-savings program to reduce expenses. We   \npared back non-coreand lower-return portfolios\nand paid down higher-cost borrowings. And all \nthe while we supported our communities in many\nways, including by committing $2.1 billion to \nsupport more than 15,000 units of affordable  \nhousing and 130,000 people served in low-to   \nmoderate-income communities. As we continue to\ndiligently execute on this critical work to   \ncapitalize on our competitive advantages and  \ndrive efficiencies, we\u2019re improving how we    \noperate and taking other steps to drive long- \nterm value for the benefit of our             \nshareholders, now and into the future.        \nNotably, in February 2024, we announced an    \nagreement to sell our remaining stake in      \nTruist Insurance Holdings to further          \nstrengthen our balance sheet and enhance our  \nstrategic flexibility to invest in the core   \nbanking franchise. I look forward to realizing\nthe company\u2019s potential even more in 2024 as  \nwe leverage our expanded capabilities and     \ntalent to actualize our purpose. At the Annual\nMeeting, we will be bidding farewell to one of\nour directors, Christine Sears, who has       \ndecided to retire from the Board at that time.\nWe deeply appreciate Christine\u2019s outstanding  \nservice over the past nine years and her      \nwisdom and commitment to advancing the        \ninterests of all of the stakeholders of       \nTruist.

Alternatively, the Board may    \nreduce the number of persons to be elected by \nthe number of directors unable to serve. In an\nuncontested election of directors, our        \narticles of incorporation require each        \ndirector to be elected by the majority of the \nvotes cast at a meeting of shareholders. Under\nour Director Resignation Policy, as described \nin our Corporate Governance Guidelines, any   \nincumbent director nominee who receives a     \ngreater number of votes \u201cagainst\u201d than votes  \n\u201cfor\u201d his or her election shall tender his or \nher resignation to the Board. The Nominating  \nand Governance Committee will then consider   \nall of the relevant facts and circumstances   \nand recommend to the Board whether to accept, \nreject or otherwise act with respect to such  \nresignation. The Board will act on the        \nNominating and Governance Committee\u2019s         \nrecommendation within 90 days following       \ncertification of the shareholder vote and will\npublicly disclose its decision within this    \n90-daytimeframe. A director whose resignation \nis under consideration will abstain from      \nparticipating in any recommendation or        \ndecision regarding that resignation. If a     \ndirector\u2019s resignation is not accepted, the   \ndirector will continue to serve until the next\nannual meeting of shareholders and until the  \ndirector\u2019s successor is elected and qualified,\nor until the director\u2019s earlier resignation or\nremoval. Each of our director nominees has    \nbeen identified as possessing good business   \nacumen, strength of character and an          \nindependent mind, as well as a reputation for \nintegrity and the highest personal and        \nprofessional ethics. Sound judgment and       \ncommunity leadership are also important       \ncharacteristics that our Board members        \npossess. Each nominee additionally brings to  \nus a strong and unique background and set of  \nskills, providing our Board with competence   \nand experience in the wide variety of areas   \nnecessary and helpful in overseeing Truist\u2019s  \nstrategy, culture and performance.

Working with its compensation        \nconsultant, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee annually assesses the               \ncompetitiveness of Truist\u2019s director          \ncompensation program relative to our peers. In\nmaking this assessment, the Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee reviews (i) the       \nindividual pay components of our program      \nrelative to the pay components for directors  \nat our peers, (ii) the average total          \ncompensation of our Board members relative to \ndirectors at our peers and (iii) our aggregate\nBoard compensation as compared to our peer    \ngroup.                                        \n                                \n  22    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nProposal 1\u2014Election of Directors The director \ncompensation shown in the table above reflects\ntotal compensation paid to each director for  \nservice as a member of the Boards of both the \nCompany and Truist Bank. A director who is    \nalso a teammate of Truist or its subsidiaries \nis not eligible to receive any equity,        \nretainer or fees for service on either Board. \nThe table below shows the fees paid to our    \nnon-employeedirectors for 2023. In its annual \nreview of our director compensation program   \nfor 2024, the Compensation and Human Capital  \nCommittee determined that no adjustments      \nneeded to be made to the fees our non-        \nemployeedirectors are entitled to receive for \n2024. Each director receives a base retainer  \nof $100,000. The Lead Director, committee     \nchairs (other than Mr. Rogers, who receives no\nadditional compensation for his role as Chair \nof the Executive Committee) and non-          \nchairmembers of the Audit and Risk Committees \nreceive the additional retainers set forth    \nbelow.                                        \n                                              \n  Amount of Annual       Position             \n  Retainer                                    \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aEach              \n  $100,000               non-employee         \n                         director             \n  $50,000                \u2022\u2002\u200aLead Director     \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aChair of the      \n                         Audit Committee \u2022\u2002\u200a  \n  $45,000                Chair of the Risk    \n                         Committee \u2022\u2002\u200aChair   \n                         of the Technology    \n                         Committee            \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aChair of the      \n                         Compensation and     \n                         Human Capital        \n  $30,000                Committee \u2022\u2002\u200aChair   \n                         of the Nominating    \n                         and Governance       \n                         Committee            \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aChair of the      \n  $20,000                Truist Bank Trust    \n                         Committee            \n                         \u2022\u2002\u200aAll non-chair     \n  $15,000                members of the       \n                         Audit and Risk       \n                         Committees           \n                                              \nDirector Equity Awards                        \n                                              \n     For 2023 and 2024 service, the Board     \n     approved $180,000 in equity-based        \n  \u2022  compensation, issued in the form of      \n     RSUs that 100% vest at the end of the    \n     year.                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     If Board service is terminated due to    \n     disability or death, all unvested RSUs   \n  \u2022  granted to a non-employee director       \n     would fully vest as of the date of       \n     disability or death.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     If Board service is terminated for any   \n  \u2022  other reason, any unvested RSUs          \n     outstanding as of the date of            \n     termination would be forfeited.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Upon a change of control, all unvested   \n     RSUs would become fully vested and a     \n  \u2022  corresponding number of shares of        \n     Truist common stock would be issuable    \n     to each director holding such RSUs.      \n                                              \nNon-EmployeeDirectors\u2019 Deferred Compensation  \nPlan. The Truist Amended and Restated Non-    \nEmployeeDirectors\u2019 Deferred Compensation Plan \npermits participating non-employeedirectors to\ndefer 50% or 100% of their retainer fees into \na deferred savings account and also to defer  \n100% of their equity compensation awards.     \nParticipating non-employeedirectors make an   \nelection upon entering the plan regarding the \ndeferral of their non-employeedirector fees   \nand equity compensation awards and the form of\ndistributions under the plan. Deferrals of    \nretainer fees are fully vested at all times   \nand are payable in cash after termination of  \nthe director\u2019s service on the Board. Deferred \nequity awards are payable in Truist shares    \nafter termination of a director\u2019s service on  \nthe Board. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Truist \nrequires each non-employeedirector to hold or \ncontrol an amount of common stock having a    \nvalue equal to at least 5x the amount of his  \nor her annual cash retainer paid by Truist for\nsuch director\u2019s services. All non-            \nemployeedirectors are expected to meet this   \nownership requirement by the later of (i) five\nyears following initial appointment as a      \ndirector, or (ii) such period of time as it   \nmay take to reach the ownership requirement   \nthreshold by holding shares or RSUs granted by\nTruist pursuant to the equity compensation    \narrangements for directors. All current       \ndirectors either met the minimum ownership    \nrequirement or were still within the time     \nframe allowed to achieve such ownership as of \nDecember 31, 2023.                            \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    23  \n                                \nCorporate Governance The Board of Directors   \nregularly reviews Truist\u2019s corporate          \ngovernance program taking into account best   \npractices, recent developments and the        \nrequirements of applicable laws and           \nregulations.                                  \n                                              \n                Key Corporate                 \n                Governance                    \n                Documents                     \n  Please visit                                \n  our website                                 \n  at https:                                   \n  //ir.truist\u2026                                \n  under                                       \n  \u201cGovernance                                 \n  &                                           \n  Responsibil\u2026                                \n  to view our                                 \n  corporate                                   \n  governance                                  \n  documents.                                  \n  Shareholders                                \n  may                          \u2022\u2002\u2009Corporate   \n  also request                 Governance     \n  a copy of                    Guidelines \u00a0   \n  any of these                 \u2022\u2002\u2009Articles    \n  documents,                   of             \n  which are                    Incorporation  \n  not                          and Bylaws \u00a0   \n  incorporated                 \u2022\u2002\u2009Charters    \n  into this                    for each of    \n  proxy                        the Company\u2019s  \n  statement by                 standing       \n  reference,                   Board          \n  by                           committees \u00a0   \n  contacting                   \u2022\u2002\u2009Code of     \n  our                          Ethics \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009   \n  Corporate                    Accounting,    \n  Secretary                    Securities     \n  at:                          and Legal      \n  Truist                       Violations     \n  Financial                    Policy         \n  Corporation                                 \n  Attn:                                       \n  Corporate                                   \n  Secretary                                   \n  214 N.

As a part of this evaluation process, \nthe Nominating and Governance Committee also  \nconsiders each director\u2019s occupation, other   \npublicly held company directorships, personal \nand affiliate transactions with Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, relationships considered in     \naccordance with our Related Person            \nTransactions Policy, and other relevant direct\nand indirect relationships that may affect    \nindependence. In particular, the Board        \nconsidered Truist\u2019s purchase or provision of  \nproducts or services during the last three    \nyears from or to each entity where a director,\nincluding Messrs. Clement and Stein, was an   \nexecutive officer or employee of such entity, \nor had an immediate family member who was an  \nexecutive officer of such entity, and where   \nthat entity made payments to or received      \npayments from Truist or any of its            \nsubsidiaries for products or services;        \nhowever, all such transactions were made: (a) \nin the ordinary course of business on         \nsubstantially the same terms as those         \nprevailing at the time for comparable services\nprovided to unrelated third parties, (b) in   \nthe aggregate for any single fiscal year, did \nnot exceed 0.25% of Truist\u2019s or such other    \nentity\u2019s gross revenue, and (c) were          \nimmaterial to both Truist and the other       \nentity. After duly considering all such       \ninformation, our Board of Directors has       \naffirmatively determined that the following   \ncurrent directors or nominees have no         \ndisqualifying material relationships with     \nTruist or its subsidiaries and are            \nindependent:                                  \n                                              \n  \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009       \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009        \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009       \u2022\u2002\u2009\u2009      \n  Jennif\u2026    Dallas      Donna      Laurence  \n  S.\u00a0        S.

William H. Rogers, Jr. \nwas deemed not to be independent due to his   \nrole as a current executive officer of Truist.\nEach member of the Audit Committee, the       \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee and  \nthe Nominating and Governance Committee has   \nbeen determined by the Board to be            \n\u201cindependent\u201d in accordance with the          \nrequirements of the NYSE, SEC, and our        \nCorporate Governance Guidelines. For more     \ndetails on our independence requirements, see \nour Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are\nnot incorporated into this proxy statement by \nreference, but which can be found on the      \nInvestor Relations page of our website at     \nhttps://ir.truist.comunder \u201cGovernance &      \nResponsibility\u201d\u2014\u201cCorporate Governance\u201d.       \nCHANGES TO JOB RESPONSIBILITIES OR POSITION If\na director changes his or her principal       \nemployment activity, position or              \nresponsibility, he or she must notify the     \nChairman of the Board and the Chair of the    \nNominating and Governance Committee of such   \nchange and offer his or her resignation from  \nthe Board. Prior to the resignation becoming  \neffective, the Board, through the Nominating  \nand Governance Committee, will review any such\nchange and determine the appropriateness of   \nthe director\u2019s continued membership on the    \nBoard. SERVICE ON OTHER BOARDS A director must\nadvise the Chairman of the Board and the Chair\nof the Nominating and Governance Committee    \nbefore accepting an invitation to serve on    \nanother public or private company board. If   \nthe invitation is to serve on another public  \ncompany board, the Nominating and Governance  \nCommittee will review whether such board      \nservice may unduly impact the ability of the  \ndirector to fulfill his or her                \nresponsibilities as a director of Truist and  \nmust approve such board service before the    \ndirector accepts the additional position. A   \nnon-employeedirector of Truist may not serve  \non more than three other public company       \nboards, and a non-employeedirector of Truist  \nwho is also the chief executive officer of    \nanother public company may not serve on more  \nthan two public company boards, including the \nTruist Board. In addition, if a member of the \nAudit Committee desires to serve on the audit \ncommittees of more than a total of three      \npublic companies, the Board must approve such \nadditional service before the director accepts\nthe additional position. Executive officers of\nTruist may serve on one public company board, \nin addition to the Truist Board, with the     \napproval of the Chief Executive Officer or, in\nthe case of the Chief Executive Officer, the  \nNominating and Governance Committee. BOARD    \nDEVELOPMENT Our Board Development Program     \nprovides a formal framework designed to       \nsupport the directors\u2019 performance of their   \nresponsibilities as members of the Board and  \nBoard committees. The Board Development       \nProgram allows directors to supplement their  \nexisting skill sets and stay informed of      \nemerging risks and trends in Truist\u2019s business\nand the broader financial services industry in\ngeneral. The Board, through formal annual     \npolling and informal requests throughout the  \nyear, identifies areas of focus for           \ndevelopment opportunities. Programs and       \ncourses are provided by both in-houseexperts  \nand outside advisors on a wide range of topics\nto enhance the directors\u2019 knowledge in areas  \nimportant in carrying out their               \nresponsibilities as directors.                \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    27  \n                                \nCorporate Governance To facilitate awareness  \nof outside learning opportunities, Truist     \nmakes available to directors a dynamic        \ncalendar of relevant programs. Management     \nreports annually to the Nominating and        \nGovernance Committee with respect to completed\ndevelopment activity over the past year and   \nplans for future development opportunities.   \nNewly elected directors undergo an extensive  \ndirector orientation process. We view the     \ndirector orientation process as a means to    \nacquaint newly elected directors with our     \nculture, businesses, operations, corporate    \ngovernance, and risk-management framework and \nalso to further their understanding of        \nTruist\u2019s competitive position within the      \nbroader financial-services industry.          \nAdditionally, directors newly appointed to any\nof the Board\u2019s committees attend an           \norientation to the committee and its duties   \nand operations. BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE     \nSELF-ASSESSMENT Cadence On an annual basis,   \nour Board of Directors evaluates its          \neffectiveness and the effectiveness of its    \ncommittees over the preceding year. Process   \nThe evaluation process, which includes both   \n(1) written self-assessments of the Board and \neach committee and (2) one-on-oneinterviews   \nwith each director, is overseen by our        \nNominating and Governance Committee. For 2023,\neach director separately interviewed with the \nChairman and the Chair of the Nominating and  \nGovernance Committee. Before distribution, the\nNominating and Governance Committee reviews   \nand approves the content of the written Board \nand committee self-assessments. Topics The    \nwritten assessments are designed to elicit    \nconstructive feedback from each director about\nthe effectiveness of the Board and each       \ncommittee on which the director serves. Topics\ncovered by the Board self-assessments         \ngenerally include:                            \n                                      \n  \u2022  primary Board responsibilities;  \n                                      \n                                              \n     management succession and oversight,     \n  \u2022  human capital management, and            \n     diversity, equity and inclusion;         \n                                              \n                            \n  \u2022  director development;  \n                            \n                                              \n  \u2022  Board interaction with management and    \n     availability of outside expertise;       \n                                              \n                                          \n  \u2022  Board structure and operations; and  \n                                          \n                                              \n  \u2022  Board committee structure and            \n     philosophy.                              \n                                              \nTopics covered by the Board committee         \nassessments generally include:                \n                                              \n  \u2022  primary responsibilities of the          \n     applicable committee; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  structure and operations of the          \n     applicable committee.                    \n                                              \nReporting and Action Items Results of each    \nself-assessment are discussed by the directors\nin executive sessions of the Board or the     \napplicable committee. This feedback is used to\ninform Board and committee priorities and     \npractices, and, as appropriate, is discussed  \nwith senior management to improve efficiencies\nand effectiveness. For example, based in part \non previous self-assessments, the Board       \nreduced its size in 2023 and provided         \nmanagement with direction on meeting cadence  \nand materials. SUCCESSION PLANNING AT TRUIST  \nHuman capital management and talent           \ndevelopment are a priority for the Board of   \nDirectors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nprovide that the Board of Directors is        \nresponsible for overseeing an executive       \nofficer succession plan, including procedures \nfor Chief Executive Officer selection in the  \nevent of an emergency or the retirement of the\nChief Executive Officer. On the recommendation\nof the Nominating and Governance Committee,   \nthe Board of Directors has adopted a          \nresolution regarding emergency succession for \nthe Chief Executive Officer. The Lead Director\nfacilitates the Board\u2019s review and evaluation \nof our executive officer succession plan. As  \npart of the plan, our Chairman and Chief      \nExecutive Officer evaluates and recommends    \npotential successors, along with a review of  \nany development plans of such individuals.    \n                                \n  28    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCorporate Governance Board Leadership         \nStructure CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF     \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER Our Board of Directors is   \nled by the Chairman. Under our bylaws, the    \nChairman is elected by the Board and presides \nover each Board meeting and performs such     \nother duties as may be incident to the office \nof Chairman. Our bylaws and Corporate         \nGovernance Guidelines each provide that the   \nChairman may also hold the position of Chief  \nExecutive Officer. Truist\u2019s Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer is not permitted to serve as\na member of any standing Board committee,     \nother than the Executive Committee, the Risk  \nCommittee or the Technology Committee. Our    \nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that  \nwhen the position of Chairman of the Board is \nnot held by an independent director, the Board\nwill appoint an independent Lead Director. It \nis the Board\u2019s current belief that having a   \nunified Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  \nis appropriate and in the best interests of   \nTruist and its shareholders. The Board        \nbelieves that combining the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer roles at this time provides \nthe following advantages to us:               \n                                              \n     our Chief Executive Officer is more      \n     familiar with our current business and   \n  \u2022  industry than our non-management         \n     directors and is best situated to lead   \n     discussions on important matters         \n     affecting the business of Truist;        \n                                              \n                                              \n     combining the Chief Executive Officer    \n     and Chairman positions, along with a     \n     strong partnership with the independent  \n  \u2022  Lead Director, creates a firm link       \n     between management and the Board and     \n     promotes both the development and        \n     implementation of corporate strategy;    \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     combining the roles of Chief Executive   \n     Officer and Chairman contributes to a    \n  \u2022  more efficient and effective Board,      \n     promotes unity of vision for the         \n     Company and avoids potential conflict    \n     among directors.                         \n                                              \nThe Board is aware of the potential issues    \nthat may arise when an insider chairs the     \nboard of a company but believes these are more\nthan offset by existing safeguards, which     \ninclude the designation of a strong           \nindependent Lead Director with a clearly      \ndefined role and authority set forth in our   \nCorporate Governance Guidelines and discussed \nfurther below. In addition, our Board         \nregularly meets in executive session, chaired \nby the independent Lead Director, with the    \nindependent directors outside the presence of \nmanagement. Further, only our independent     \ndirectors are involved in meetings to discuss \nsuccession planning and CEO compensation. The \nBoard believes its approach to risk oversight,\nas more fully discussed below under \u201cRisk     \nOversight,\u201d enables the Board to choose from  \nmany leadership structures while continuing to\neffectively oversee risk. INDEPENDENT LEAD    \nDIRECTOR Effective March 12, 2022, Thomas E.  \nSkains was appointed as the Board\u2019s           \nindependent Lead Director, subject to the     \nrotation policy for Lead Director service as  \nset forth in our Corporate Governance         \nGuidelines. Our Corporate Governance          \nGuidelines require that our Lead Director (i) \nbe appointed by a majority vote of the        \nindependent directors and (ii) serve in such  \ncapacity for an initial two-yearterm (subject \nto annual election as a director by the       \nshareholders), and may serve for subsequent   \none-yearterm(s) at the discretion of the      \nBoard. Mr. Skains\u2019 term as Lead Director was  \nrecently extended by the Board until March 12,\n2025. Our Board believes that the Lead        \nDirector serves an important corporate        \ngovernance function by providing strong,      \nindependent leadership for the non-           \nmanagementdirectors and provides an           \nappropriate balance to the Chairman and CEO.  \nThe Lead Director\u2019s responsibilities, as      \noutlined in our Corporate Governance          \nGuidelines, include:                          \n                                              \n     approving Board agendas and information  \n  \u2022  sent to the Board in preparation for     \n     Board meetings;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  calling and presiding over meetings of   \n     the independent directors;               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  approving all Board and committee        \n     meeting schedules;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     chairing executive sessions of           \n  \u2022  non-management directors during          \n     scheduled Board meetings; and            \n                                              \n                                              \n     if the Chairman and CEO roles are        \n  \u2022  combined and the combined Chairman and   \n     CEO serves as Chair of the Executive     \n     Committee:                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cb  serving as a member of the Executive     \n     Committee;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     approving Executive Committee meeting    \n  \u25cb  schedules, suggesting agenda items, and  \n     approving agendas;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u25cb  approving information sent to Executive  \n     Committee members for meetings; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n     presiding over Executive Committee       \n  \u25cb  meetings at which the Chair is not       \n     present (including executive sessions).  \n                                              \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    29  \n                                \nCorporate Governance In addition to the formal\nlist of duties performed by our Lead Director \nas set forth in our Corporate Governance      \nGuidelines, he also meets with regulators,    \nsupports shareholder engagement and attends   \nmeetings with senior management. A more       \ncomplete description of the role of our Lead  \nDirector is included in our Corporate         \nGovernance Guidelines and in the discussion   \nabove under \u201cStanding Board Committee         \nMembership and Lead Director                  \nResponsibilities.\u201d Board Size and             \nQualifications Truist announced changes to the\nBoard in October 2023, including the          \nretirements of Kelly S. King, Nido R. Qubein, \nDavid M. Ratcliffe and Thomas N. Thompson,    \neffective December 31, 2023, due to these     \ndirectors reaching Truist\u2019s mandatory         \nretirement age, and the conclusions of service\nof Anna R. Cablik, Paul D. Donahue, Easter A. \nMaynard and Frank P. Scruggs, Jr., effective  \nDecember 31, 2023. With these changes, the    \nsize of the Board was reduced to 13 directors \nentering 2024, 12 of whom are independent. In \naddition, Christine Sears has indicated a     \npreference not to stand for reelection and    \nwill retire from the Board at the Annual      \nMeeting. Our Board believes that the remaining\ndirectors continue to have an appropriate mix \nof skills and qualifications to lead Truist as\nit focuses on simplifying and streamlining its\nbusiness. Of the remaining directors, several \nhave broad experience in regulatory strategy  \nand compliance, including directors who have  \nserved as (i) a former regional director with \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and  \nas Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer for   \ntwo major financial institutions, (ii) CEO of \na regional bank, and (iii) CEO of a major     \nnatural gas utility. Each of these directors  \nhas experience in leading businesses or       \noperations in a regulated environment and     \ninteracting with regulatory agencies. Several \ndirectors also have direct experience managing\ncapital and liquidity. In addition to the     \ndirectors with CEO experience mentioned above,\nthe Board also includes directors who serve or\nhave served as (i) CFO of a major aerospace,  \ndefense, information security and technology  \ncorporation, (ii) CEO and CFO of a            \nmultinational manufacturer of paper and       \npackaging products, and (iii) President and   \nCFO of a large media, technology, and         \ncommunications conglomerate. In these roles,  \nthe directors have overseen the capital       \nstructure of their companies and managed      \nliquidity planning and analysis. In addition, \nour first time nominee identified in this     \nproxy statement, Laurence Stein, will bring   \nvaluable experience to the Board in financial \nservices and financial risk management as he  \nrecently retired after serving for many years \nin various senior executive roles with a      \nlarge, complex financial institution. Our     \nBoard will continue to annually evaluate its  \nsize and composition. Nominating and          \nGovernance Committee Director Nominations The \nNominating and Governance Committee is        \nresponsible for identifying and recommending  \nto the Board nominees for election or         \nreelection as directors. We seek as director  \ncandidates individuals who possess good       \njudgment, strength of character, and an       \nindependent mind, as well as a reputation for \nintegrity and the highest personal and        \nprofessional ethics in order to most          \neffectively serve the long-term interests of  \nTruist and its shareholders. The Nominating   \nand Governance Committee considers candidates \nsubmitted by directors and third-party search \nfirms hired for identifying director          \ncandidates. The Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee also considers candidates           \nrecommended by shareholders. Director         \ncandidates, including those recommended by    \nshareholders, will be evaluated using the     \ndirector membership criteria described below. \nThe Board considers the Nominating and        \nGovernance Committee\u2019s recommendations when   \nappointing directors and selecting director   \nnominees to be submitted to shareholders for  \nelection at the annual meeting of             \nshareholders. DIRECTOR MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA A  \ndirector candidate is nominated to stand for  \nelection based on his or her professional     \nexperience, strategic insights, recognized    \nachievement in his or her respective field, an\nability to contribute to our business,        \nexperience in risk management and the         \nwillingness to make the commitment of time and\neffort required of a Truist director over an  \nextended period of time. A director must be   \n\u201cfinancially literate,\u201d as defined by the     \nBoard, and should understand the intricacies  \nof a public company. A director should possess\ngood judgment, strength of character and an   \nindependent mind, as well as a reputation for \nintegrity and the highest personal and        \nprofessional ethics. Other factors are also   \nconsidered in the context of assessing the    \noverall composition of the Board. An important\ngoal of the Board, pursued through the        \nNominating and Governance Committee, is to    \ninclude members with diverse backgrounds,     \nexpertise and characteristics (including      \ndiversity of race, ethnicity and gender) that,\ntaken as a whole, will help ensure a strong   \nand effective governing body. The Nominating  \nand Governance Committee annually assesses    \nthese factors in the director selection and   \nnomination process. The first time nominee    \nincluded in this proxy statement, Laurence    \nStein, was identified by a search firm        \nretained by the Nominating and Governance     \nCommittee and was considered by the Nominating\nand Governance Committee and the Board in     \naccordance with these procedures prior to     \nbeing nominated for election to the Board.    \nDIRECTOR CANDIDATES RECOMMENDED BY            \nSHAREHOLDERS The Board of Directors will      \nconsider qualified director nominees          \nrecommended by shareholders. Those            \nrecommendations should be sent in writing to  \nthe Corporate Secretary, Truist Financial     \nCorporation, 214 N. Tryon Street, 43rd Floor, \nMail Code 500-93-43-13,Charlotte, North       \nCarolina 28202. The Nominating and Governance \nCommittee will evaluate director candidates   \nrecommended by shareholders using the director\nmembership criteria described above.          \n                                \n  30    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCorporate Governance Majority Voting and      \nDirector Resignation Policy Our articles of   \nincorporation require each director to be     \nelected by the majority of the votes cast at a\nmeeting of shareholders. Under our Director   \nResignation Policy, as described in our       \nCorporate Governance Guidelines, any incumbent\ndirector nominee who receives a greater number\nof votes \u201cagainst\u201d than votes \u201cfor\u201d such      \nelection shall tender his or her resignation  \nto the Board. The Nominating and Governance   \nCommittee will then consider all of the       \nrelevant facts and circumstances and recommend\nto the Board whether to accept, reject or     \notherwise act with respect to such            \nresignation. The Board will act on the        \nNominating and Governance Committee\u2019s         \nrecommendation within 90 days following       \ncertification of the shareholder vote and will\npublicly disclose its decision within this    \n90-daytimeframe. A director whose resignation \nis under consideration will abstain from      \nparticipating in any recommendation or        \ndecision regarding that resignation. If a     \ndirector\u2019s resignation is not accepted, the   \ndirector will continue to serve until the next\nannual meeting of shareholders and until the  \ndirector\u2019s successor is elected and qualified,\nor until the director\u2019s earlier resignation or\nremoval. Currently, pursuant to North Carolina\nlaw and our bylaws, an incumbent director who \nis not re-electedremains in office until the  \ndirector\u2019s successor is elected and qualified \nor until his or her earlier resignation or    \nremoval. Our current Director Resignation     \nPolicy addresses this \u201choldover\u201d issue by     \nrequiring any director who does not receive   \nthe requisite affirmative majority of the     \nvotes cast for his or her reelection to tender\nhis or her resignation to the Board as        \ndescribed above. Related Person Transactions  \nPursuant to our Related Person Transactions   \nPolicy, we approve or ratify related person   \ntransactions only when the Board, acting      \nthrough the Nominating and Governance         \nCommittee, determines that the related person \ntransaction in question is in, or is not      \ninconsistent with, the best interests of      \nTruist and its shareholders. The term \u201crelated\nperson transaction,\u201d under the Related Person \nTransactions Policy, generally means a        \ntransaction where the amount involved exceeds \n$120,000 in a single fiscal year and in which \na related person has a direct or indirect     \nmaterial interest. A \u201crelated person\u201d under   \nthe Related Person Transactions Policy        \ngenerally means (a) a director, director      \nnominee or executive officer of Truist; (b) a \nperson who is known to be the beneficial owner\nof more than five percent of any class of our \ncommon stock; and (c) any immediate family    \nmember of any of the foregoing persons, which \nconsists of any child, stepchild, parent,     \nstepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law,   \nfather-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,   \nbrother-in-lawor sister-in-lawof the director,\nexecutive officer, nominee or more than five  \npercent beneficial owner, and any person      \n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the \nhousehold of such director, executive officer,\nnominee or more than five percent beneficial  \nowner. To help the Board assess whether a     \nmaterial relationship exists for both         \nindependence and related person transactions  \npurposes, our Board adopted guidance with     \nregard to charitable contributions. Under this\nguidance, a related person who serves as an   \nexecutive officer of a charitable or non-     \nprofitorganization that receives a            \ncontribution from Truist will not be deemed to\nhave a direct or indirect material interest in\nthe transaction if:                           \n                                              \n     Within the past three years, the         \n     aggregate amount of all such             \n     contributions during any single fiscal   \n     year of the charitable or non-profit     \n  \u2022  organization did not exceed the greater  \n     of $1\u00a0million or 2% of the charitable    \n     or non-profit organization\u2019s             \n     consolidated gross revenues for that     \n     fiscal year; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     The charitable or non-profit             \n     organization is not a family foundation  \n  \u2022  created by the related person or an      \n     immediate family member of the related   \n     person.                                  \n                                              \nIn addition, to monitor charitable            \ncontributions provided by Truist, any         \ncharitable contribution in excess of $5       \nmillion made by Truist to any charitable or   \nnon-profitorganization of which a director or \nexecutive officer of Truist serves as a       \ndirector, trustee, executive officer, advisory\nboard member or in any similar leadership     \ncapacity must be approved by the Nominating   \nand Governance Committee, whether or not the  \ndirector or executive officer has a direct or \nindirect material interest in the             \ncontribution. Further, charitable             \ncontributions of $500,000 or more to such     \norganizations must be reported at the next    \nNominating and Governance Committee meeting. A\nnumber of our directors, executive officers,  \nand their affiliates utilize certain products \nand services offered by Truist, including     \npersonal and corporate banking, securities    \nbrokerage, investment advisory and wealth     \nmanagement services, in the ordinary course of\nour business. Our Related Person Transactions \nPolicy provides that certain categories of    \ntransactions do not need review or approval of\nthe Nominating and Governance Committee. These\ninclude all extensions of credit with related \npersons that are made in the ordinary course  \nof business on substantially the same terms,  \nincluding interest rates and collateral, as   \nthose prevailing at the time for comparable   \nloans with persons not related to Truist, and \nthat do not involve more than the normal risk \nof collectability or present other features   \nunfavorable to Truist (although pursuant to   \nFederal Reserve Board Regulation O, extensions\nof credit to directors, executive officers or \ntheir related interests that exceed $500,000  \nin the aggregate must be approved in advance  \nby the full Board). These transactions also   \ninclude any provision of financial services to\na related person, other than extensions of    \ncredit, such as brokerage, banking, insurance,\ninvestment advisory, investment banking or    \nasset management services, if the services are\n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    31  \n                                \nCorporate Governance provided in the ordinary \ncourse of business, on substantially the same \nterms as those prevailing at the time for     \ncomparable services provided to unrelated     \nthird parties and comply with applicable law. \nIn addition, in the ordinary course of        \nbusiness, Truist may use the products or      \nservices of organizations of which one of our \ndirectors is an officer or director. Since    \nJanuary 1, 2023, other than as described      \nbelow, there have been no related person      \ntransactions that were required either to be  \napproved or ratified under our Related Person \nTransactions Policy or reported under the     \nSEC\u2019s related person transaction rules. In    \nconnection with the Stone Point Transaction,  \nTIH implemented a program to permit select    \ninsurance teammates to co-investin TIH        \nalongside the private equity fund partners. As\npart of this program and to facilitate the co-\ninvestments,TIH offered teammates the option  \nto finance their investments though pre-      \nqualifiedterm loans secured by the teammate\u2019s \nequity interests in TIH and paid through      \ndeducting 25% of the gross, pre-taxamount of  \neach cash incentive payment made to the       \nteammate in his or role at TIH until paid in  \nfull with any remaining balance due at the end\nof the term. John M. Howard (who at the time  \nwas no longer an executive officer of Truist) \nparticipated in the co-investmentopportunity  \nand took advantage of the financing option by \nreceiving a loan in the amount of $3 million  \naccruing interest at the Applicable Federal   \nRate on the date of the loan (3.79%). The TIH \nloan program did not consist of credit that   \nTruist extends in the ordinary course of      \nbusiness to unrelated third parties. As such, \nthe loan to Mr. Howard was ratified by the    \nNominating and Governance Committee in        \naccordance with our Policy. Based on          \ninformation contained in separate Schedule    \n13G/A filings with the SEC, each of BlackRock,\nInc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. reported    \nthat it beneficially owned more than 5% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock as of  \nDecember 31, 2023. During 2023, we, and our   \naffiliates, engaged in transactions in the    \nordinary course of business with BlackRock and\nVanguard, including sales of debt securities  \nof the Company in public offerings of those   \nsecurities and sales of other fixed income    \nsecurities by our institutional broker-dealer \nsubsidiary. Such transactions were on         \nsubstantially the same terms as those         \nprevailing at the time for comparable         \ntransactions with unrelated third parties.    \nSection 16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the    \nExchange Act requires our directors, executive\nofficers and any persons who own beneficially \nmore than 10% of our common stock to file     \nreports of ownership and changes in ownership \nwith the SEC. To our knowledge, based solely  \non a review of the reports furnished to us and\nwritten representations from reporting persons\nthat all reportable transactions were         \nreported, we believe that during the fiscal   \nyear ended December 31, 2023, our officers,   \ndirectors and greater than 10% owners timely  \nfiled all reports they were required to file  \nunder Section 16(a). Shareholder Engagement   \nProgram GENERAL Truist\u2019s shareholder          \nengagement program is a robust, year-round    \nprocess, incorporating analysis of results of \nour annual meeting, key topics of importance  \nto our shareholders and Board deliberations.  \nWe listen closely to our shareholders to      \nunderstand their views on a variety of topics,\nincluding our executive compensation and      \ncorporate governance programs, as well as     \ncorporate responsibility and sustainability   \nissues involving the Company. At Truist, our  \nshareholder engagement program is designed to \nencompass a dialogue with our shareholders on \nseveral levels, including:                    \n                                              \n  \u2022  Periodic telephonic meetings with our    \n     larger institutional shareholders;       \n                                              \n                                              \n     In-person, or virtual, meetings with     \n  \u2022  institutional shareholder                \n     representatives as requested;            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Responses to shareholder                 \n     correspondence;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Dialogue with proponents of shareholder  \n     proposals; and                           \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u2022  Engagement with proxy advisory firms.  \n                                            \nTruist\u2019s Nominating and Governance Committee  \nis responsible for overseeing our shareholder \nengagement program, which includes meetings   \nwith our largest shareholders led by senior   \nmanagement and, in certain cases, our         \nindependent Lead Director.

The full Board also      \nreceives updates on key accomplishments and   \nupcoming initiatives. Three management        \ncommittees support the Board committees in    \ntheir oversight of ESG-relatedmatters.

The Disclosure Committee reports to\nthe Audit Committee and reviews our principal \nESG disclosures prior to publication.

Complaints regarding these matters   \nare referred to our Chief Legal Officer, who  \nis responsible for reviewing the complaints   \nand investigating or causing to be            \ninvestigated all matters referred pursuant to \nthis policy. The Audit Committee periodically \nreviews and recommends changes to this policy \nand receives reports on investigations of     \nsignificant complaints that are submitted.    \nRisk Oversight Our Purpose, Mission and Values\nare the foundation for the enterprise risk    \nmanagement framework utilized at Truist and   \ntherefore serve as the basis on which our risk\nappetite and risk strategy are built. Our Risk\nManagement Organization (\u201cRMO\u201d) is responsible\nfor overseeing the identification,            \nmeasurement, monitoring, assessment,          \ncontrolling and reporting of risk across the  \nenterprise. We place significant emphasis on  \nrisk management and maintain a separate Board-\nlevel Risk Committee, which plays a key risk  \noversight role within our enterprise risk     \nmanagement framework. Among its               \nresponsibilities, the Risk Committee monitors \nour risk profile, approves risk appetite      \nstatements and provides input to management   \nregarding our risk appetite and risk profile. \nThe RMO is led by the Chief Risk Officer, who \nreports directly to the Risk Committee and    \nadministratively to the Chief Executive       \nOfficer, and is responsible for facilitating  \neffective risk management oversight,          \nmeasurement, monitoring and reporting. The    \nChief Risk Officer has direct access to our   \nBoard of Directors and executive officers to  \ncommunicate any risk issues (current or       \nemerging) and the performance of risk         \nmanagement activities throughout the          \nenterprise. The Chief Risk Officer also chairs\nthe Enterprise Risk Committee, which provides \noversight based on a fully integrated view of \nrisks across our organization, including      \nstrategic, compliance, credit, liquidity,     \nmarket, operational, climate, technology and  \nreputational risks.                           \n                                \n  36    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCorporate Governance As illustrated below, the\nenterprise risk management framework is       \nsupported by three lines of defense to manage \nrisk. The following figure describes the roles\nof the three lines of defense:                \n                                              \n                        Provide oversight of  \n                        the effectiveness of  \n                        the enterprise risk   \n  Board of Directors    management            \n                        framework, the        \n                        management of risk    \n                        and the approval of   \n                        risk appetite         \n                                              \n                                              \n     First Line of Defense. Consisting of     \n     the Business Units (\u201cBU\u201d) and the        \n     Governance and Controls Office (\u201cGCO\u201d)   \n     teams and operating at the point at      \n     which risks originate, the First Line    \n     of Defense has several key               \n  \u2022  responsibilities related to              \n     identifying, assessing, controlling,     \n     monitoring and reporting risk. As the    \n     centralized first line risk function     \n     for each BU, the GCO has key             \n     responsibilities for identifying,        \n     assessing, controlling, monitoring and   \n     reporting risks.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Second Line of Defense. The RMO          \n     provides independent oversight and       \n     challenge of risk-taking across the      \n     enterprise. The RMO aggregates,          \n     integrates and correlates risk           \n  \u2022  information into a holistic picture of   \n     the Company\u2019s risk profile. The RMO      \n     establishes policies and limits and      \n     reports sources and amounts of risk to   \n     senior management and the Board of       \n     Directors.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Third Line of Defense. Truist Audit      \n     Services (Truist\u2019s internal audit        \n     function) evaluates the design and       \n  \u2022  effectiveness of the risk management     \n     framework and its results. Results are   \n     reported to senior management and the    \n     Board of Directors according to the      \n     Audit Services Policy.                   \n                                              \nStrategic Direction and Planning One of the   \nBoard\u2019s most important and vital functions is \nto provide oversight, guidance and direction  \nwith respect to Truist\u2019s long-term strategy.  \nThe Board oversees the development of,        \napproves and periodically monitors the        \nCompany\u2019s strategy and risk appetite          \n(including a clear and aligned strategy and   \nrisk appetite with long-term perspective on   \nrisks and rewards). Accordingly, management   \nand the Board regularly discuss the Company\u2019s \nstrategy and progress towards achieving       \nresults against the related strategic         \nobjectives and initiatives. These interactions\nresult in Board input that informs            \nmanagement\u2019s updates to the strategic plan,   \nwhich are presented to the Board for adoption \non an annual basis. The Company\u2019s strategic   \nplanning process includes an independent risk \nassessment to confirm that strategic          \nactivities are consistent with the Board-     \napproved risk appetite. The Board\u2019s           \ninteractions with management throughout the   \nyear include, but are not limited to, the     \nformal review and adoption of the updated     \nstrategic plan and a mid-yearperformance      \nupdate. Information Security/Cybersecurity    \nLike other financial services firms, we and   \nour businesses face an increasingly complex   \nand evolving cybersecurity threat environment.\nWe maintain a risk-based cybersecurity        \nframework that is part of our enterprise-wide \nrisk management framework. Our Board has      \nprimary responsibility for the oversight of   \nour enterprise risk management, and exercises \nits oversight function in respect of          \ncybersecurity risk through two of its         \ncommittees.

Based upon a\nreview of the reports by, and discussions     \nwith, management and the independent          \nregistered public accounting firm, and the    \nAudit Committee\u2019s review of the               \nrepresentations of management and the Report  \nof the Independent Registered Public          \nAccounting Firm, the Audit Committee          \nrecommended on February 26, 2024 to the Board \nof Directors that the audited financial       \nstatements be included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2023,\nfiled with the SEC on February 27, 2024.      \nSubmitted by the Audit Committee of the Truist\nBoard of Directors as of February 26, 2024:   \n                                              \n  Dallas S.

The Compensation and    \nHuman Capital Committee and the Board believe \nthat our executive compensation program, as   \ndescribed in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and \nAnalysis,\u201d reflects a pay-for-                \nperformanceculture at Truist that is rooted in\nour values. The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and the Board believe that the      \nexecutive compensation program is well        \ndesigned and effective in aligning the        \ninterests of the executives with the long-term\ninterests of our shareholders, while          \nminimizing incentives for unnecessary and     \nexcessive risk taking. We hold this advisory  \nvote to approve our executive compensation    \nprogram annually (i.e., our next vote will be \nin 2025), and our next advisory vote regarding\nthe frequency of these votes will be held at  \nour 2029 annual meeting. In making a decision \non whether to approve our pay practices for   \nour named executive officers, we ask that you \nconsider the description of our executive     \ncompensation program provided in the following\npages in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and     \nAnalysis,\u201d the compensation tables and the    \naccompanying narratives. The Board strongly   \nsupports our executive pay practices and asks \nshareholders to support our executive         \ncompensation program through the following    \nresolution: \u201cResolved, that the shareholders  \napprove the compensation paid to Truist\u2019s     \nnamed executive officers, as described in the \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis, the     \ncompensation tables and the related narrative \ndisclosures in the Company\u2019s 2024 Proxy       \nStatement.\u201d Your vote on this proposal, which \nis required by Section 14A of the Exchange    \nAct, is \u201cadvisory\u201d and will serve as a non-   \nbindingrecommendation to the Board.

This year, our\nNEOs also include John M. Howard, who served  \nas an executive officer of Truist until       \nFebruary 2023 when Truist announced the Stone \nPoint Transaction. In connection with the     \nStone Point Transaction, Mr. Howard continued \nin the role of Chief Executive Officer of TIH,\nwith Truist shifting some of his enterprise-  \nwide responsibilities in order to focus on    \nmaximizing the success of TIH. Mr. Howard     \nwould have been included as one of our next   \nthree most highly compensated executive       \nofficers but for the fact that he was not     \nserving in a role designated as an executive  \nofficer of Truist as of the end of our last   \ncompleted fiscal year. Our NEOs for 2023 are  \nidentified in the table below. General        \nstatements about our NEOs in this CD&A do not \ninclude Mr. Howard as he participated in      \ndifferent short and long-termincentive        \nprograms in 2023 that were focused primarily  \non the business of TIH and are described      \nseparately from the programs for the other    \nNEOs in the commentary below.                 \n                                              \n                                    Years\u00a0of  \n  Name           Title           Service\u2002 at  \n                                   Truist(1)  \n                 Chairman                     \n  William H.     and Chief                43  \n  Rogers, Jr.    Executive                    \n                 Officer                      \n                 Senior                       \n                 Executive                    \n  Michael B.

Hugh\nS. \u201cBeau\u201d Cummins III assumed the Chief       \nOperating Officer role on November 14, 2023.  \nHis responsibilities in this new role include \nleading enterprise strategy, transformation,  \noperations and payments, as well as a new     \ngovernance and controls group. The            \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee      \n(which we refer to in the CD&A as the         \n\u201cCommittee\u201d) did not make any adjustments to  \nMr. Cummins\u2019 compensation arrangements in     \nconnection with his new role.

In addition, on  \n  February 12, 2024, Kristin Lesher joined    \n  Truist as the new Chief Wholesale Banking   \n  Officer, overseeing corporate and           \n  investment banking, commercial banking,     \n  commercial real estate, and wealth          \n  management businesses.As part of its        \n  ongoing transformation work, in November    \n  2023, Truist also announced the formation   \n  of a Truist Operating Council to expand     \n  leadership opportunities, facilitate        \n  inclusive feedback and break down silos to  \n  enable the Company to more effectively      \n  pursue its goals.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSIn      \n  2023, Truist navigated significant          \n  changes, opportunities and challenges.      \n  Headwinds entering the year included high   \n  inflation, supply-chain disruptions,        \n  interest-rate volatility, and intense       \n  competition for deposits. Many of these     \n  were later exacerbated by the impacts of    \n  the bank failures in the first half of      \n  2023, including higher volatility in        \n  market conditions and an even more          \n  challenging regulatory environment.

                      \n                                              \n  \u2022  Remain competitive with the market in    \n     attracting and retaining top talent,     \n

              \n                                              \n     Use performance metrics with an          \n  \u2022  appropriate balance between short and    \n     long-term performance, and absolute and  \n     relative performance, and                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Reduce incentives for

created     \nTruist, the orientation of the program was    \nshifted by replacing Relative Return on       \nAverage Assets with Absolute Pre-ProvisionNet \nRevenue (\u201cPPNR\u201d) as a performance metric in   \nthe AIP awards program and adjusting the      \nweightings of the financial performance       \nmetrics with PPNR and Absolute Earnings Per   \nShare (\u201cEPS\u201d) each accounting for 40% of the  \noverall AIP target. In addition, Return on    \nAverage Tangible Common Equity (\u201cROATCE\u201d) was \neliminated as a performance metric for the    \nlong-term incentive program, and Truist\u2019s     \ntotal shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d) relative to  \nits peer group was added as a modifier. These \nchanges were designed to (i) increase the     \nfocus on profitable growth, (ii) better align \nthe program\u2019s performance metrics with the key\nperformance indicators that drive TSR, and    \n(iii) set a higher performance bar for the    \nvesting and payout of incentive compensation  \nawards to our executives. In lieu of          \nparticipating in the AIP, Mr. Howard          \nparticipated in a short-term incentive for    \n2023 calculated as follows: 25% based on the  \nsame performance criteria applicable to the   \nAIP awards as described below and 75% based on\nperformance metrics relating solely to TIH. In\naddition, in connection with the Stone Point  \nTransaction, Mr. Howard was granted incentive \nequity in TIH. Mr. Howard also exchanged his  \nunvested long-term incentive awards in Truist \nfor additional time-vesting profits interests \nin TIH. The size of the profits interests     \ngrant was intended to cover long-term         \nincentive awards for the five-year period     \nfollowing the Stone Point Transaction and was \nmade in lieu of any other long-term incentive \ncompensation grant that Mr. Howard would have \notherwise been eligible to receive during this\nperiod. The design of the profits interests   \nwas developed in collaboration with the       \nInvestor Group to align the interests of all  \nTIH equity holders.                           \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    45  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Base     \nSalaries \u2013 Aligned with organizational roles  \nand market pay Base salaries provide the      \nfoundational component of executive pay and   \nreflect each executive\u2019s position,            \nresponsibilities, experience and performance  \nas well as consideration of market pay        \npractices. Following a review of competitive  \nmarket data provided by our compensation      \nconsultant, the Committee approved base salary\nincreases for two of our NEOs. Annual         \nIncentive Performance Award \u2013 Rewards annual  \nperformance tied to strategic plan The AIP    \naward program was developed to motivate and   \nreward financial and strategic performance    \nthat defines our success. The program in 2023 \nincluded absolute financial performance       \nmetrics as well as a qualitative assessment of\nperformance on strategic priorities and other \ncritical factors of our success, as evaluated \nby the Committee. The EPS and PPNR metrics and\nour performance against them include          \nadjustments to Truist\u2019s GAAP net income       \ndesigned to more appropriately evaluate our   \ncore performance. As such, the terms \u201cEPS\u201d and\n\u201cPPNR\u201d used in this CD&A refer to these as-   \nadjustedvalues, which differ from those       \nidentified in the Financial Performance       \nHighlights above and the Company\u2019s financial  \nreporting disclosures. For additional detail  \nregarding these adjustments, and the          \ncalculation of EPS and PPNR, please refer to  \nAnnex A. The strategic priorities component   \ncan be earned if threshold performance is met \nfor either EPS or PPNR. While the primary     \nfocus of the program for 2023 was growth and  \nprofitability consistent with Truist\u2019s        \nstrategic plan, the Committee also believed   \nthat our annual incentive payouts should be   \ninformed by other elements of performance. For\ninstance, sustainability and human capital    \nmetrics were added as factors in the          \nqualitative assessment for 2021 and remained  \nfactors for 2022 and 2023, reflecting the     \nincreased focus on these matters within the   \nCompany and their ability to impact Truist\u2019s  \nbusiness performance. Payouts on EPS and PPNR \nare not interdependent; each measure is scored\nindependently, and the results are then       \ncombined. Truist\u2019s results on EPS and PPNR are\nsubject to a potential modifier (through which\nup to 15% in the aggregate for both metrics   \nmay be added to or subtracted from the initial\nresults) based on the Committee\u2019s evaluation  \nof the Company\u2019s performance relative to      \npeers, market conditions and other factors    \nconsidered relevant by the Committee. If      \nthreshold performance is met for either EPS or\nPPNR, points awarded by the Committee for     \nperformance on the strategic priorities       \ncomponent are then added to the combined EPS  \nand PPNR score. Long-Term Incentive Program \u2013 \nRewards future performance aligned with our   \nshareholders The long-term incentive program  \nis intended to provide a significant portion  \nof executive pay opportunity based on our     \nfuture performance and value creation for our \nshareholders. Under this program, 65% of an   \nexecutive\u2019s long-term incentive opportunity is\nat risk based purely on our performance (40%  \nas PSU awards that settle in stock and 25% as \nLTIP awards that generally settle in cash).   \nThe remaining 35% of the long-term incentive  \nopportunity is granted as time-based RSUs,    \nwhich are subject to reduction or forfeiture  \nif there is an aggregate operating loss for   \nthe performance period or if a significant    \nnegative risk outcome occurs as determined by \nthe Committee. For the 2023\u20132025 long-term    \nincentive program, the realized value of the  \nLTIP and PSU awards is based on three-year    \nperformance with respect to Truist\u2019s Return on\nAverage Common Equity (\u201cROACE\u201d) relative to   \nthe peer group (weighted at 100%) with a      \nrelative TSR modifier that will increase the  \npayout by 20 percentage points if the         \nCompany\u2019s TSR is in the top quartile of the   \npeer group for the performance period and     \nreduce the payout by 20 percentage points if  \nthe Company\u2019s TSR is in the bottom quartile of\nthe peer group for the performance period. An \nabsolute minimum level of ROACE must be       \nachieved ( \u22657%) before any of the PSU and LTIP\nawards will vest. These metrics were designed \nto motivate strong profitability that         \nultimately drives favorable shareholder       \nreturns and incentivize robust yields on      \ncapital deployed towards mergers and          \nacquisitions. The Committee has discretion to \nsettle the LTIP awards in equity, cash or     \nboth. Historically, the Committee has settled \nthe LTIP in cash because of the significant   \nproportion of the NEOs\u2019 long-term incentive   \ncompensation that is settled in equity and in \nlight of the substantial Truist common stock  \nholdings of most of our NEOs. The ROACE and   \nROATCE metrics (for awards granted prior to   \n2023) and our performance against them include\nadjustments to Truist\u2019s GAAP net income. As   \nsuch, the terms \u201cROACE\u201d and \u201cROATCE\u201d used in  \nthis CD&A refer to these as-adjustedvalues,   \nwhich differ from those disclosed for         \nfinancial reporting purposes.

Compensation Philosophy Our  \nexecutive compensation program emphasizes     \nlong-term, performance-based compensation and \nis centered on the following key tenets:      \n                                              \n     Compensation and reward systems are      \n     designed to reward performance, to       \n  \u2022  support and drive the achievement of     \n     our strategic objectives and to produce  \n     positive business results over the       \n     longer term;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Total compensation is based on           \n     achievement of both short- and           \n     long-term performance goals, with an     \n  \u2022  emphasis on aligning long-term Company   \n     performance with shareholder interests   \n     by providing a significant percentage    \n     of compensation in equity;               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our executive compensation program is    \n     designed to promote balance between      \n  \u2022  absolute and relative performance        \n     metrics and discourage imprudent risk    \n     taking;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Total compensation opportunities are     \n     established relative to organizations    \n     with which we compete for both talent    \n  \u2022  and shareholder investment and at        \n     levels that enable us to attract and     \n     retain executives who are critical to    \n     our long-term success;                   \n                                              \n

In 2023, the  \nexecutive compensation for our NEOs received  \nsupport from approximately 93% of the votes   \ncast at the annual shareholders meeting. 2023 \nPay Program Mix A significant majority of     \nexecutive pay is performance-based.           \nApproximately 92% of our CEO\u2019s target pay is  \nbased on the Company\u2019s performance and        \napproximately 68% is based on the Company\u2019s   \nlong-term performance. The following charts   \nillustrate the target annual compensation for \nour CEO, Mr. Rogers, and the average target   \nannual compensation for Messrs. Cummins,      \nMaguire, Starnes and Wilson based on the      \ncompensation structure in place for these     \nofficers as of December 31, 2023. Such        \ncompensation consists of base salary and      \ntarget levels of AIP, PSU, LTIP and RSU       \nawards. The charts also show the large        \npercentage of our NEO compensation that is    \nvariable and performance-based.               \n                                \n  48    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis          \n                                              \n                PERFORMANCE-\u2026                 \n                COMPONENTS                    \n  2023 Annual                                 \n  Incentive                                   \n  Performance                  2023-2025      \n  Award                        Long-Term      \n  Performance                  Incentive      \n  Metrics                      Program        \n  Absolute EPS                 Performance    \n  (40%)                        Metrics \u00a0 PSU  \n  Absolute                     and LTIP       \n  PPNR (40%)                   Awards \u00a0       \n  Strategic                    Relative       \n  Priorities                   ROACE (100%)   \n  Assessment                   TSR Modifier   \n  (20%)                        PSU, LTIP and  \n  Potential                    RSU Awards \u00a0   \n  modifier of                  Subject to     \n  up to 15% in                 reduction or   \n  the                          forfeiture in  \n  aggregate                    the event of   \n  based on the                 an annual      \n  Committee\u2019s                  operating      \n  evaluation                   loss or a      \n  of Company                   significant    \n  performance                  negative risk  \n  relative to                  outcome as     \n  peers,                       determined by  \n  market                       the Committee  \n  conditions                                  \n  and other                                   \n  factors                                     \n                                              \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    49  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis 2023     \nExecutive Compensation Program Elements Our   \nexecutive compensation program is heavily     \nperformance-based, with base salary           \nrepresenting the only fixed element.

In 2023, Mr. Wilson received a merit   \nincrease to his base salary, effective as of  \nMarch 1, 2023, and Mr. Howard\u2019s base salary   \nwas increased, effective as of February 15,   \n2023, due to the realignment of his role as   \nthe Chief Executive Officer of TIH in         \nconnection with the Stone Point Transaction.  \nThe salaries of the other NEOs did not change.\n                                              \n  Name             Base\u00a0Salary\u00a0               \n                   ($)                        \n  William H.                       1,200,000  \n  Rogers, Jr.                                 \n  Michael B.                         700,000  \n  Maguire                                     \n  Hugh S.                            800,000  \n  Cummins III                                 \n  Clarke R.                          760,000  \n  Starnes III                                 \n  Dont\u00e1 L.                           695,833  \n  Wilson                                      \n  John M.                            975,758  \n  Howard                                      \n                                              \nAnnual Incentive Performance Awards Program   \nSummary The AIP award program was approved by \nthe Committee based on its review of market   \nand best practices. The AIP award is a cash   \nincentive that, for 2023, rewarded financial  \nperformance (measured by EPS and PPNR) as well\nas the execution of strategic priorities based\non the following weightings: While payouts    \nbased upon the EPS component and the PPNR     \ncomponent are independent from one another, a \npayout under the strategic priorities         \ncomponent requires the Company to meet        \nthreshold performance on either the EPS       \ncomponent or the PPNR component. Payouts under\neach component of our AIP award program can   \nrange from 0% to 200% of the target award     \nopportunity. EPS and PPNR results between     \n\u201cThreshold\u201d, \u201cTarget\u201d and \u201cMaximum\u201d goals are \nsubject to linear interpolation. Truist\u2019s     \nresults on EPS and PPNR are subject to a      \npotential modifier (through which up to 15% in\nthe aggregate for both metrics may be added to\nor subtracted from the initial results) based \non the Committee\u2019s evaluation of the Company\u2019s\nperformance relative to peers, market         \nconditions and other factors considered       \nrelevant by the Committee.                    \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    51  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Each of  \nour NEOs has a target award opportunity for   \nthe annual incentive expressed as a percentage\nof base salary, which represents the amount of\nAIP award received if the executive achieves  \nall of the goals approved by the Committee at \nthe target level of performance.

Based on its assessment of Truist\u2019s   \nresults, the Committee determined that the    \nstrategic priorities component was earned at  \n100% of its target amount. In making this     \ndecision, the Committee recognized the launch \nof multiple initiatives to enhance the        \nteammate experience, continued growth and     \nprogress in the areas of ESG reporting,       \nprogress on goals for integrated relationship \nmanagement, including surpassing an internal  \ngoal on number of clients helped, the         \nsuccessful launch of the Small Business       \nCommunity Heroes initiative and the           \nachievement of the business lifecycle advisory\ngoal, but also determined that there were     \nopportunities for improvement in several      \nareas, including client experience and        \nteammate engagement results, some aspects of  \nrisk management, and advancement on digitizing\nthe business. Overall Payouts After making the\nadjustments to the financial results as       \ndescribed above and assessing performance     \nbased on the strategic priorities component,  \nthe Committee approved initial funding of AIP \nawards at 39.11% of target for each NEO. The  \nCommittee then assessed whether it was        \nappropriate to utilize the potential modifier \nthrough which up to 15% in the aggregate for  \nboth financial performance metrics may be     \nadded to or subtracted from the initial       \nresults. The Committee considered management\u2019s\nactions in navigating the challenging 2023    \nconditions, including bank failures and a     \nmacroeconomic environment that differed from  \nthe assumptions used in determining the EPS   \nand PPNR targets, and applied the modifier to \nset the final funding of awards at 50% of     \ntarget. Finally, the Committee analyzed       \nindividual NEO performance against their goals\nfor 2023 and risk management and made         \nadjustments to the awards for Messrs. Rogers, \nCummins and Starnes. In summary, the AIP award\npayments to our NEOs for 2023 were as follows:\n                                              \n               Target      Funded     Actual  \n               Amount       Award      Award  \n  William                                     \n  H.         $3,600,\u2026    $1,800,\u2026    $1,440\u2026  \n  Rogers,                                     \n  Jr.                                         \n  Michael                       $          $  \n  B.         $1,260,\u2026     630,000    630,000  \n  Maguire                                     \n  Hugh S.                                     \n  Cummins    $2,280,\u2026    $1,140,\u2026    $1,026\u2026  \n  III                                         \n  Clarke                                      \n  R.         $1,634,\u2026           $          $  \n  Starnes                 817,000    490,200  \n  III                                         \n  Dont\u00e1                         $          $  \n  L.         $1,330,\u2026     665,000    665,000  \n  Wilson                                      \n                                              \nMr. Howard\u2019s Short-Term Incentive In lieu of  \nparticipating in the AIP, Mr. Howard          \nparticipated in a short-term incentive for    \n2023 calculated as follows: 25% based on the  \nsame performance criteria applicable to the   \nAIP awards as described above and 75% based on\nperformance metrics relating solely to TIH.   \nThe performance metrics relating solely to TIH\nincluded financial performance as well as a   \nqualitative assessment of performance on      \nstrategic priorities of TIH, including the TIH\nindependence readiness initiative and Mr.     \nHoward\u2019s overall leadership of the business.  \nThe TIH financial performance metrics         \nconsisted of pro forma total revenue growth,  \norganic commission and fee revenue growth rate\nand pro forma adjusted EBIDTA margin.

For 2023, these   \nawards utilized the same metrics linking      \npayouts to relative three-year ROACE          \nperformance with a TSR modifier. The Committee\nchose ROACE as the performance measure for the\nlong-term incentive awards based on the belief\nthat this metric is highly correlated to      \npositive TSR and provides an incentive to earn\nstrong returns on the capital deployed towards\nmergers and acquisitions (which often result  \nin an increase in goodwill and intangibles).  \nThe long-term performance results presented in\nthis proxy statement include adjustments to   \nTruist\u2019s GAAP net income. For additional      \ndetail regarding these adjustments, please    \nrefer to Annex A. The performance goals and   \npayout ranges are established at the beginning\nof the cycle ( i.e., early 2023 for the       \n2023-2025 performance period). LTIP awards    \nhave historically been settled in cash, but at\nthe discretion of the Committee, may be       \nsettled in shares of Truist common stock, cash\nor both. Dividends are not accrued or paid on \nPSUs and LTIP awards during their vesting     \nperiods.                                      \n                                \n  54    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Pay      \nDecisions For 2023, the Committee granted PSUs\nand LTIP awards to our NEOs with the following\nfeatures:                                     \n                                              \n2023-2025 PSU and LTIP Awards (Granted in 2023\nand Vest/Settle in 2026) Performance Period   \nThree years Vesting Requirements and          \nForfeiture Provisions Three-year cliff vesting\nthrough March 15, 2026, with 100% of the award\nbeing subject to reduction or forfeiture if   \nthere is an aggregate operating loss for the  \nperformance period or if a significant        \nnegative risk outcome occurs as determined by \nthe Committee.

The Committee believes that with the \nsignificant proportion of the NEOs\u2019 long-term \nincentive compensation that is settled in     \nequity, including the vesting of the PSUs from\nthese awards, and in light of the substantial \nTruist common stock holdings of most of our   \nNEOs, it was appropriate to settle the        \n2021-2023 LTIP awards in cash.                \n                                \n  56    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis          \nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUs) RSUs complement \nother elements in our long-term incentive     \nprogram and are linked to the sustainable     \nappreciation of our stock price. Pay Decisions\nFor 2023, the Committee granted RSUs with the \nfollowing features: 2023 RSU Awards Vesting   \nPeriod The RSUs vest in 1/3 increments over 4 \nyears for all NEOs beginning on March 15      \nfollowing the second anniversary of the grant \ndate. Vesting Requirements and Forfeiture     \nProvisions The 2023 RSUs are subject to       \nreduction or forfeiture if Truist has incurred\nan annual operating loss for the year or the  \nCommittee determines that there has been a    \nsignificant negative risk outcome as a result \nof a corporate or individual action. Dividend \nTreatment Dividends are not paid on unvested  \nRSUs. Mr. Howard\u2019s Profits Interests in TIH In\nconnection with negotiating the Stone Point   \nTransaction to sell a minority equity stake in\nTIH, Truist worked in collaboration with the  \nInvestor Group to develop a compensation      \nprogram that would align TIH executives with  \nthe interests of all TIH equity holders. Based\non these discussions, Mr. Howard was granted  \nincentive equity awards in TIH in the form of \nboth time-vesting and event-vesting profits   \ninterests (50% of each) with an aggregate     \nBlack-Scholes value of approximately          \n$17,500,000. The size of the grant was        \nintended to cover long-term incentive awards  \nfor a five-year period following the Stone    \nPoint Transaction and was made in lieu of any \nother long-term incentive compensation grant  \nthat Mr. Howard would have otherwise been     \neligible to receive during that period. The   \nawards were granted in two installments, with \nthe first grant in June 2023 and the second in\nDecember 2023 based on a final valuation. The \nTIH profits interests will only provide value \nto Mr. Howard based on any increase in the    \nvalue of TIH over the value of TIH as of the  \ndate that the profits interests were granted  \n(taking into account the investment by the    \nInvestor Group). If the value of TIH does not \nincrease, then Mr. Howard will receive no     \nvalue from the profits interests in TIH. The  \ntime-vesting profits interests will vest      \n(subject to continued employment) ratably in  \nfour equal annual installments (25% each) on  \neach of the first four anniversaries of April \n4, 2023, the date that the Stone Point        \nTransaction closed. For the time-vesting      \nprofits interests, there is no right to       \naccelerated vesting on a change in control,   \ninitial public offering or spin-off. The      \nvesting of the event-vesting profits interests\nwill occur on a change in control of TIH or   \nwithin a specified period of time following an\ninitial public offering or spin-off of TIH    \n(the time period between an initial public    \noffering or spin-off of TIH and the vesting of\nsuch interests is referred to herein as the   \n\u201cpost-event vesting period\u201d). In addition, Mr.\nHoward must remain employed through the       \nconsummation of the applicable event or       \nvesting date in order for the event-vesting   \nprofits interests to vest. Mr. Howard also    \nexchanged his unvested long-term incentive    \nawards in Truist for additional time-vesting  \nprofits interests in TIH. The Committee       \nreviewed Mr. Howard\u2019s unvested long-term      \nincentive awards in Truist and concluded that \nthe Truist grants should be replaced with     \nprofits interests issued by TIH because of Mr.\nHoward\u2019s shift in responsibilities after the  \nStone Point Transaction in order to align his \ninterests more closely with those of TIH\u2019s    \nshareholders, including Truist. The Truist    \ngrants were converted based on their          \noutstanding value as of the date of the       \nclosing of the Stone Point Transaction and    \nwere adjusted into time-vesting TIH profits   \ninterests. These time-vesting profits         \ninterests vest pro rata over the same four-   \nyear period as described above. As with the   \nincentive award described above, the profits  \ninterests granted in exchange for the         \noutstanding Truist awards were made in two    \ninstallments in May and December of 2023 to   \nensure alignment with the final valuation of  \nthe awards. Limited Perquisites Our NEOs      \nreceive limited perquisites and other personal\nbenefits that the Committee believes are      \nreasonable and consistent with our overall    \nexecutive compensation program. Such          \nperquisites may include residential security  \nservices, executive physical wellness         \nexaminations, occasional use of sports        \ntickets, spousal participation in certain     \ncorporate events and limited personal use of  \nthe company aircraft and driver. Our NEOs do  \nnot receive the following perquisites:        \ncorporate housing, personal club memberships  \nor automobile allowances.                     \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    57  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Teammate \nBenefits PENSION PLAN                         \n                                              \n     We provide the Truist Financial          \n     Corporation Pension Plan, a              \n     tax-qualified defined benefit            \n     retirement plan for eligible teammates   \n     (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d).

The Committee believes      \n     that the benefits provided by the        \n     Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan       \n     enable us to maximize the retention      \n     benefits of the Pension Plan.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Pension Plan and the Non-Qualified   \n     Defined Benefit Plan are broad-based     \n  \u2022  benefits, and the NEOs participate in    \n     both plans on the same basis as other    \n     similarly situated teammates.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Pension Plan and the Non-Qualified   \n     Defined Benefit Plan provide retirement  \n     benefits based on length of service and  \n  \u2022  cash compensation level prior to         \n     retirement with benefits generally       \n     increasing substantially as a            \n     participant approaches retirement.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     We believe the retirement benefits       \n     provided by the Pension Plan are         \n  \u2022  meaningful to all teammates, but         \n     especially to those who have devoted     \n     substantial service to Truist.           \n                                              \nMoreover, we view the Pension Plan and the    \nNon-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan as important\nretention tools for the NEOs and other highly \ncompensated teammates. These retirement       \nbenefits could not easily be replicated upon  \nthe teammate\u2019s departure from Truist prior to \nretirement. The Committee believes that while \nthe overall retirement benefits provided to   \nthe NEOs are reasonable relative to those     \nprovided by its peer group, the Pension Plan  \nand Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan provide \nus with a competitive advantage in attracting \nand retaining talent in light of the high     \nnumber of companies that have frozen or       \nabandoned traditional pension plans.

In       \n     addition, Truist added a discretionary   \n     matching contribution paid to 401(k)     \n     Savings Plan participants based on       \n     Truist\u2019s achievement of certain          \n  *  financial goals.                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nThe teammate benefits for the NEOs discussed  \nin this subsection are determined by the same \ncriteria applicable to all of our teammates.  \nIn general, benefits are designed to provide a\nsafety net of protection against the financial\ncatastrophes that can result from illness,    \ndisability or death, and to provide a         \nreasonable level of retirement income based on\nyears of service with Truist. These benefits  \nare part of the strong value proposition we   \noffer our teammates in furtherance of our     \npurpose and help keep us competitive in       \nattracting and retaining teammates. We believe\nthat our teammate benefits are generally on   \npar with benefits provided by our peer group  \nand consistent with industry standards.       \n                                \n  58    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Section  \n4\u2014Executive Compensation Process\u2014Decision     \nInputs and Roles Decision Making Calendar 2023\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROCESS \u2013 COMPENSATION \nAND HUMAN CAPITAL COMMITTEE                   \n                                              \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review executive risk  \n                    scorecard for the prior   \n                    year \u2022\u2002\u2009Receive reports   \n                    from the Chief Audit      \n                    Officer regarding risk    \n                    management and internal   \n                    control effectiveness \u2022\u2002  \n                    Approve financial         \n                    results and adjustments   \n                    for incentive plans \u2022\u2002\u2009   \n                    Determine                 \n                    payments/vesting for      \n                    incentive plans with      \n                    performance periods       \n  First Quarter     completed the prior year  \n                    (AIP, LTIP, PSUs and      \n                    RSUs) \u2022\u2002\u2009Approve peer     \n                    group for the current     \n                    year \u2022\u2002\u2009Set company       \n                    financial targets and     \n                    performance measures for  \n                    the current year to       \n                    determine AIP awards,     \n                    LTIP and PSUs \u2022\u2002\u2009Set      \n                    executive officer         \n                    compensation for current  \n                    year \u2013 base salary,       \n                    short-term and long-term  \n                    incentive targets \u2022\u2002\u2009     \n                    Review tally sheets       \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review projected       \n  Second Quarter    financial results with    \n                    proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive plans           \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Conduct a mid-year     \n                    review of current         \n                    executive risk scorecard  \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review projected       \n                    financial results with    \n                    proposed adjustments for  \n  Third Quarter     incentive plans \u2022\u2002\u2009       \n                    Review of executive       \n                    officer compensation      \n                    with the Committee\u2019s      \n                    compensation consultant,  \n                    Meridian Compensation     \n                    Partners, LLC             \n                    (\u201cMeridian\u201d)              \n                    \u2022\u2002\u2009Review projected       \n                    financial results with    \n  Fourth Quarter    proposed adjustments for  \n                    incentive plans \u2022\u2002\u2009       \n                    Conduct annual review of  \n                    director compensation     \n                                              \nPeer Group and Competitive Analyses The       \nCommittee uses a peer group to perform        \ncompetitive assessments of executive          \ncompensation as well as to measure performance\nunder our short- and long-term incentive      \nplans. The Committee approves a group of      \npublicly-traded banks or financial services   \nholding companies each year to serve as the   \npeer group. The Committee selected a peer     \ngroup in 2020 and has re-evaluatedthat peer   \ngroup on an annual basis since that time. In  \nevaluating the peer group, the Committee      \nconsiders a number of factors, including      \nindustry and business mix, regulatory         \noversight, assets, revenues and market        \ncapitalization. The Committee believes it is  \nimportant for the peer group to focus on other\nbanks for performance comparisons and as our  \nprimary market for executive talent. However, \nthe Committee recognizes that there are       \ncurrently only two regional banks similar to  \nour size (i.e., within one-halfto two times   \nour assets and revenues). To create a         \nreasonable sample size for both pay and       \nperformance comparisons, the Committee has    \ndetermined that it is appropriate to include  \nadditional companies that provide a balance of\nlarger and smaller banks. Based on its        \ncomprehensive review, the Committee approved  \nmaintaining the peer group consisting of the  \nfollowing 10 companies. Given the wide range  \nin sizes among the peer banks, the Committee  \nuses its judgment in evaluating pay levels    \nrelative to the market data and does not      \ntarget pay at a specific percentile of peers. \n                                              \n       TRU\u2026                                   \n       2023                                   \n       PEER                                   \n       GRO\u2026                                   \n               Ass\u2026             Mar\u2026          \n  Co\u2026          ($\u00a0              Cap\u2026          \n  Na\u2026          in\u00a0              ($            \n               bil\u2026             in            \n                                bil\u2026          \n  JP\u2026                                         \n  Ch\u2026                $3,\u2026             $4\u2026     \n  (N\u2026                                         \n  JP\u2026                                         \n  Ba\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  Am\u2026                $3,\u2026             $2\u2026     \n  (N\u2026                                         \n  BA\u2026                                         \n  We\u2026                                         \n  Fa\u2026                $1,\u2026             $1\u2026     \n  (N\u2026                                         \n  WF\u2026                                         \n  U.\u2026                                         \n  Ba\u2026                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 663              67     \n  US\u2026                                         \n  PNC                                         \n  Fi\u2026                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 562              62     \n  PN\u2026                                         \n  Tr\u2026                                         \n  Fi\u2026                   $               $     \n  Co\u2026                 535              49     \n  (N\u2026                                         \n  TF\u2026                                         \n  Ci\u2026                                         \n  Fi\u2026                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 222              15     \n  CF\u2026                                         \n  Fi\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 215              23     \n  FI\u2026                                         \n  M&T                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 208              23     \n  MT\u2026                                         \n  Key                                         \n  Co\u2026                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 188              13     \n  KE\u2026                                         \n  Re\u2026                   $               $     \n  (N\u2026                 152              18     \n  RF)                                         \n  Tr\u2026                                         \n  Fi\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                  50  %           50  %  \n  pe\u2026                                         \n  ra\u2026                                         \n                                              \n* Data sourced from S&P Global Market         \nIntelligence as of December 31, 2023.         \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    59  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis The      \ncompensation structure for the NEOs emphasizes\nvariable pay based on performance. We         \ngenerally compare each element of compensation\nas well as total compensation relative to the \npeer group. In establishing target pay        \nopportunities, the Committee reviews market   \ndata from our peers as well as other financial\nservices firms. The Committee establishes pay \nlevels for each executive that are appropriate\nbased on market data as well as other critical\nfactors, including each executive\u2019s specific  \nrole, performance, experience, expertise,     \ninternal pay comparisons and relative         \nresponsibilities of the NEOs. In addition to  \nthe external peer group analysis, the         \nCommittee also reviews detailed tally sheets  \nfor each executive and compares the total     \ncompensation for each executive officer       \nrelative to one another. This practice is     \nconsistent with our compensation philosophy of\nrewarding our teammates based upon their level\nof responsibility within the Company.         \nRegulatory Considerations in Setting          \nCompensation Banking regulators have provided \ninput on and influenced the compensation      \npractices and incentive compensation          \nstructures at the largest financial           \ninstitutions in the United States, focusing on\nthe risks intrinsic to the design and         \nimplementation of compensation plans as well  \nas the reasonableness of each element of      \ncompensation. Regulatory guidance is          \nconsidered in the design and implementation of\nour executive compensation programs. The      \nCommittee continues to assess our pay         \npractices to balance risks and meet           \nstakeholder expectations with our commitment  \nto link NEO pay to our performance while      \nmaintaining executive compensation programs   \nthat are market competitive and shareholder   \naligned. Role of Compensation and Human       \nCapital Committee The Committee administers   \nTruist\u2019s compensation program for NEOs in a   \nmanner consistent with our Purpose, Mission   \nand Values. The Committee\u2019s authority and     \nresponsibilities are set forth in its charter \nand include but are not limited to:           \n                                              \n     reviewing and approving the              \n  \u2022  compensation for the CEO and the         \n     remaining NEOs and executive officers;   \n                                              \n                                              \n     selecting and approving the performance  \n     metrics and goals for the executive      \n  \u2022  compensation program and evaluating      \n     performance at the end of each           \n     performance period;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  approving award opportunities for our    \n     AIP awards, PSUs, RSUs and LTIP awards;  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  reviewing the executive risk scorecard   \n     for executive officers;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  conducting an annual review of director  \n     compensation; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     having the authority to delegate to its  \n     Chair, to a subcommittee of at least     \n     three Committee members or to            \n  \u2022  management such power and authority as   \n     the Committee deems to be appropriate,   \n     except such powers and authorities       \n     required by law or regulation to be      \n     exercised by the whole Committee.        \n                                              \nIn making compensation decisions, the         \nCommittee uses several resources and tools,   \nincluding the services of the Committee\u2019s     \ncompensation consultant, Meridian. The        \nCommittee also considers summary analyses of  \ntotal compensation delineating each           \ncompensation element (\u201ctally sheets\u201d), an     \nexecutive risk scorecard provided by our Chief\nRisk Officer, competitive benchmarking, a     \nreview of the Company\u2019s internal control      \neffectiveness and other analyses. PERFORMANCE \nADJUSTMENTS The Committee retains discretion  \nto make adjustments to our performance, as    \nwell as the reported results from members of  \nour peer group, for purposes of making        \nperformance-based compensation awards.        \n                                              \n     Throughout the year, the Committee       \n     reviews projected results and items for  \n     possible adjustment. At the beginning    \n     of each year, the Committee receives     \n     final performance information for the    \n  \u2022  prior year, and historically has made    \n     adjustments to our reported results      \n     (e.g., net income) so that the           \n     applicable compensatory plans fairly     \n     compensate participants for core Truist  \n     performance.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Committee may also make adjustments  \n     to the reported performance of peer      \n  \u2022  group members for awards that measure    \n     our performance relative to the peer     \n     group.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     A reconciliation of adjustments that     \n  \u2022  the Committee made for the purposes of   \n     certifying 2023 performance is included  \n     in Annex A to this proxy statement.      \n                                              \nUnless otherwise indicated, discussions of    \n2023 performance for compensation purposes in \nthis proxy statement include these adjustments\nmade by the Committee.                        \n                                \n  60    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Role of  \nManagement in Compensation Decisions The      \nCommittee periodically receives reports from  \nour Chief Audit Officer, the head of our      \ninternal audit function, regarding our        \ninternal controls. The Committee also receives\nreports from our Chief Risk Officer on our    \nExecutive Risk Outcomes Assessment for the    \nCompany and individual executives. The purpose\nof these reports and review is to allow the   \nCommittee to evaluate our current risk        \nenvironment and internal control positions    \nrelevant to incentive compensation, and to    \ntake these issues into consideration when     \ndetermining incentive compensation. The CEO is\nalso involved in compensation determinations  \nfor executive officers, other than himself,   \nincluding compensation for each of the other  \nNEOs, and makes recommendations to the        \nCommittee on base salary and the other        \ncompensation elements. We believe that the CEO\nis in the best position to assess the         \nperformance of the other executive officers,  \nand accordingly, he plays an important role in\nthe compensation setting process for executive\nofficers. Ultimately, however, decisions about\nindividual compensation elements and total    \ncompensation of all executive officers are    \nmade by the Committee, based primarily on the \nexecutive officer\u2019s performance and our       \noverall performance, with consideration of the\nbusiness environment in which the results were\nachieved. In addition, the Risk Committee     \nprovides input with respect to and approves   \nthe compensation of the Chief Risk Officer,   \nand the Audit Committee provides input with   \nrespect to and approves the compensation of   \nthe Chief Audit Officer. Role of Compensation \nConsultant The Committee engages a            \ncompensation consultant to provide market     \nreference perspective and serve as an advisor.\nThe compensation consultant serves at the     \nrequest of, and reports directly to, the      \nCommittee. Further, the Committee has the sole\nauthority to approve the compensation         \nconsultant\u2019s fees and other retention terms,  \nincluding the authority to limit the amount of\nfees the compensation consultant may earn from\nother services provided to Truist. The        \nCommittee has retained Meridian to act as the \nCommittee\u2019s compensation consultant. In this  \ncapacity, Meridian performed a review of our  \nexecutive compensation programs, provided peer\ngroup analyses and advised on regulatory      \ndevelopments, corporate governance and best   \npractice trends. The Committee determined     \nthat, based on its review, Meridian is        \nindependent and that its engagement did not   \npresent any conflicts of interest. In making  \nthis determination, the Committee noted that  \nMeridian (i) provides no services to Truist   \nother than compensation consulting, (ii) has  \nno personal or business relationships with    \nmembers of our Board or executive officers,   \n(iii) does not directly own any shares of     \nTruist stock, and (iv) retains a written      \npolicy designed to avoid conflicts of interest\nthat may arise. Meridian also determined that \nit was independent from our management and    \nconfirmed this in a written statement provided\nto the Chair of the Committee. During 2023,   \nthe compensation consultant provided the      \nfollowing services to the Committee:          \n                                              \n     reviewed our Company\u2019s total             \n  \u2022  compensation philosophy for              \n     reasonableness and appropriateness;      \n                                              \n                                            \n  \u2022  reviewed overall compensation levels;  \n                                            \n                                              \n     reviewed our total executive             \n     compensation program relative to peers   \n  \u2022  and advised the Committee of plans or    \n     practices that may be changed to         \n     improve effectiveness;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     provided market and peer data and        \n  \u2022  recommendations on executive officer     \n     and senior management compensation;      \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  reviewed and advised the Committee on    \n     the composition of our peer group;       \n                                              \n                                              \n     reviewed public disclosure on            \n     compensation, including drafts of this   \n  \u2022  CD&A and related tables and              \n     compensation disclosures in this proxy   \n     statement; and                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  advised the Committee regarding the      \n     compensation of outside directors.       \n                                              \nIn order for a compensation consultant to     \nprovide effective advice, the Committee       \nexpects them to interact with our management  \nfrom time to time. These interactions         \ngenerally involve, among other things:        \n                                              \n     obtaining compensation and benefits      \n  \u2022  data, as well as other relevant          \n     information that is not available from   \n     public sources;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     working with management to understand    \n  \u2022  the scope of the various executive jobs  \n     in order to provide accurate             \n     benchmarking; and                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     conferring with management to            \n  \u2022  understand our business strategy and     \n     circumstances.                           \n                                              \nThis process enables the compensation         \nconsultant to identify any areas where further\nresearch or analysis may be necessary, while  \nallowing it to discuss any changes to the     \nexecutive compensation program or refine      \nrecommendations before finalizing its reports \nto the Committee.                             \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    61  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Executive\nRisk Scorecard/Risk Adjustments We utilize an \nexecutive risk scorecard, which the Committee \nmay use to adjust, if necessary, the short-   \nterm and long-term incentive compensation of  \neach NEO.

Section 5\u2014Other  \nCompensation and Benefits Policies and        \nPractices In addition to the key components of\nour executive compensation program described  \nabove, other significant policies, plans and  \nfactors influence executive compensation,     \nincluding the compensation of the NEOs. These \npolicies and practices support strong         \ngovernance of our executive compensation      \nprogram and promote alignment of our          \nexecutives\u2019 interests with those of           \nshareholders. Compensation Practices and the  \nImpact on Risk Management We expect all       \nexecutive officers to exhibit the highest     \nlevels of ethics and demonstrate best         \npractices to discourage unnecessary or        \nexcessive risk taking when conducting         \nactivities on behalf of Truist. The Committee \nannually considers whether our executive      \ncompensation program encourages unnecessary or\nexcessive risk taking. In reviewing the       \nprogram for risk, the goal of the Committee is\nto design an executive compensation program to\nencourage prudent risk management and         \ndiscourage inappropriate risk-taking by       \ngranting a diverse portfolio of compensation  \nto our NEOs that is expected to reward the    \ncreation of shareholder value over time. When \ndetermining incentive compensation, and       \nconsistent with regulatory guidance, the      \nCommittee evaluates our current risk          \nenvironment and internal control structure    \nrelevant to incentive compensation and reviews\nan executive risk scorecard and other reports.\nThe Committee also receives reports from our  \nChief Audit Officer regarding the             \neffectiveness of our overall system of        \ninternal controls. BALANCE BETWEEN SHORT- AND \nLONG-TERM COMPENSATION ELEMENTS The Committee \nbelieves that having market-competitive fixed \nbase salaries discourages inappropriate risk- \ntaking. In addition, executives have a        \nsignificant proportion of compensation        \nprovided in the form of equity awards, such as\nPSUs and RSUs that have performance and       \nvesting features that extend over several     \nyears. Additionally, LTIP awards are based on \nour performance over a three-year period,     \nencouraging our NEOs to focus on long-term    \nperformance, rather than just annual results, \nand further reducing risk-taking that is      \nlikely to produce only short-term benefits and\nallowing sufficient time for risk outcomes to \nemerge. USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT      \nADJUST FOR RISK To help encourage prudent risk\nmanagement, the Committee considers the risk  \nprofile of the primary compensation elements. \nUnder our incentive programs, we use          \nperformance metrics that closely correlate to \nshareholder return. Similarly, our incentive  \nprograms include measures that adjust for     \nrisk, including the use of the executive risk \nscorecard. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION RECOUPMENT  \nPOLICY AND CLAWBACK AND FORFEITURE PROVISIONS \nIN 2022 INCENTIVE PLAN AND RELATED AWARD      \nAGREEMENTS Our Executive Compensation         \nRecoupment Policy, adopted by the Committee in\n2023, as well as clawback and forfeiture      \nprovisions in the 2022 Incentive Plan and     \nrelated award agreements, also discourage     \nimprudent risk-taking. Pursuant to the        \nExecutive Compensation Recoupment Policy,     \nTruist is required to recover, unless the     \nCommittee determines that the recovery is     \nimpractical, the excess of any incentive-based\ncompensation received by any (i) current or   \nformer executive officer and (ii) any other   \nteammate of Truist and its subsidiaries       \ndesignated by the Committee as subject to the \nExecutive Compensation Recoupment Policy from \ntime to time (each, a                         \n                                \n  62    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis \u201cCovered \nExecutive\u201d), over the incentive-based         \ncompensation that should have been received by\nthe Covered Executive during the applicable   \nrecoupment period if there is a restatement of\nTruist\u2019s financial statements. The recoupment \nperiod is the three fiscal years completed    \nimmediately preceding the earlier of (i) the  \ndate that the Board (or a committee thereof,  \nor the officer(s) of Truist authorized to take\nsuch action if Board action is not required)  \nconcludes, or reasonably should have          \nconcluded, that Truist is required to prepare \na financial restatement, and (ii) the date on \nwhich a court, regulator or other legally     \nauthorized body causes Truist to prepare a    \nfinancial restatement. Under the Executive    \nCompensation Recoupment Policy, Truist may not\nindemnify any Covered Executive, directly or  \nindirectly, for any losses that such Covered  \nExecutive may incur in connection with the    \nrecovery of erroneously awarded compensation, \nincluding through the payment of insurance    \npremiums or gross-uppayments. Truist\u2019s        \nobligation to recover erroneously awarded     \ncompensation is not dependent on (i) if or    \nwhen the restated financial statements are    \nfiled or (ii) any fault of the Covered        \nExecutive for the accounting errors leading to\na restatement. In addition, our 2022 Incentive\nPlan, which is the plan pursuant to which we  \nnow make all of our AIP, PSU, LTIP and RSU    \nawards, and related award agreements contain  \nbroad language regarding clawbacks and make   \nall awards under the 2022 Incentive Plan      \nsubject to recoupment, forfeiture or reduction\nto the extent determined by the Committee as  \nnecessary to comply with applicable law or    \nTruist\u2019s policies. Our award agreements also  \nallow the Committee to adjust the terms and   \nconditions of the awards in recognition of    \ncertain events, including material restatement\nof our financial statements, to prevent       \ndilution or enlargement of benefits intended  \nto be made under the applicable plan. The 2022\nIncentive Plan and award agreements and any   \nother document setting forth the terms and    \nconditions of any compensation covered by the \nExecutive Compensation Recoupment Policy are  \ndeemed to include the restrictions imposed by \nthe Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy, \nand in the event of any inconsistency, the    \nterms of the Executive Compensation Recoupment\nPolicy govern. Our Board believes that the    \ncurrent structure of Truist\u2019s incentive       \ncompensation recoupment practices is          \nappropriate, effective, provides a balanced   \napproach to risk management and properly      \naligns the interests of our executive officers\nand shareholders. STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS\nThe Committee believes that executive         \nofficers, including the NEOs, should          \naccumulate meaningful equity stakes in Truist \nover time to further align their economic     \ninterests with the interests of shareholders, \nthereby promoting our objective of increasing \nshareholder value. We have robust stock       \nownership requirements so that our executives \nhave significant value tied to long-term stock\nprice performance which discourages a focus on\nshort-term results and imprudent risk-taking. \nIn accordance with our Corporate Governance   \nGuidelines, our CEO is required to own Truist \nstock having a value equal to at least 6x his \nbase salary, while the other executive        \nofficers are required to own Truist stock     \nhaving a value of at least 3x their base      \nsalary. The Corporate Governance Guidelines   \nrequire the minimum level of ownership to be  \nmet by the later of (i) five years after      \ninitially being appointed an executive        \nofficer, or (ii) such period of time as it    \ntakes to reach the ownership requirement by   \ncontinuously holding the shares or RSUs       \ngranted by Truist pursuant to its equity      \ncompensation arrangements. As of December 31, \n2023, each executive officer met these        \nrequirements as applicable to him or her      \n(whether by owning the required value of      \nshares or still being within the grace period \nto achieve such ownership level). RESPONSIBLE \nEQUITY GRANT PRACTICES Generally, the timing  \nof our regular annual equity awards is        \ndetermined months in advance of the actual    \ngrants in order to coincide with the regularly\nscheduled February meetings of the Board and  \nthe Committee. The grant date is established  \nwhen the grants and all key terms are approved\nby the Board or the Committee, as the case may\nbe. For the 2023 PSU and RSU awards, the      \nCommittee used the closing price of our common\nstock on the grant date to determine the      \nnumber of PSU and RSU awards that were        \ngranted. In addition, the 2022 Incentive Plan \nincludes prohibitions on the repricing of     \nstock options without shareholder approval. We\nare required to recognize the expense of all  \nshare-based awards (such as PSUs and RSUs) in \nour income statement over the award\u2019s minimum \nrequired service period. Pledging and Hedging \nof Shares Our Code of Ethics prohibits all    \nteammates from speculative trading in Truist  \nsecurities (including prohibitions on short-  \nselling and trading put options). Our         \nSecurities Trades by Company Personnel Policy \nprohibits Section 16 reporting persons, which \ninclude directors and executive officers, from\nengaging in hedging transactions (including   \nshort sales, trading in puts, calls, and other\noptions or derivatives). Teammates who are not\nSection 16 reporting persons are prohibited   \nfrom engaging in hedging transactions, other  \nthan transactions that hedge against an       \nexisting long position in Truist securities if\nthe shares underlying the position are readily\navailable for sale or delivery and the        \nexercise or strike price of the hedge is above\nthe then-current market price of the shares.  \nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit  \nthe pledging of Truist shares by directors and\nexecutive officers. Currently, none of our    \ndirectors or executive officers hold Truist   \nshares that are subject to pledges or hedges. \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    63  \n                                \nCompensation Discussion and Analysis Tax      \nConsiderations Section 162(m) of the Internal \nRevenue Code generally disallows a federal    \nincome tax deduction for compensation over $1 \nmillion paid for any fiscal year to the CEO   \nand specified other executive officers. Due to\nthe continued importance and benefit to the   \nCompany and our shareholders of awarding      \ncompensation that is structured to properly   \nincentivize our executive officers, the       \nCommittee believes that it is in our best     \ninterests to retain flexibility in awarding   \ncompensation, even if some awards may be non- \ndeductiblecompensation expenses to the        \nCompany. Compensation and Human Capital       \nCommittee Report on Executive Compensation    \nThis Compensation and Human Capital Committee \nReport on Executive Compensation is required  \nby the SEC and, in accordance with the SEC\u2019s  \nrules, will not be deemed to be part of or    \nincorporated by reference by any general      \nstatement incorporating by reference this     \nproxy statement into any filing under the     \nSecurities Act or the Exchange Act, except to \nthe extent that we specifically incorporate   \nthis information by reference, and will not   \notherwise be deemed \u201csoliciting material\u201d or  \n\u201cfiled\u201d under either the Securities Act or the\nExchange Act.

In 2023, PSUs and RSUs  \n       were granted to the NEOs, other than   \n       Messrs.

For 2023, PSUs were  \n       valued using a Monte Carlo simulation  \n       assuming a probable payout as of the   \n       grant date of target performance and   \n       estimating the fair value associated   \n       with a probable payout at target       \n       ($43.79 for PSUs granted on February\u00a0  \n       27 and $42.26 for PSUs granted on      \n       March 3), consistent with the          \n       approach for FASB ASC Topic 718        \n       expensing. For February\u00a027, 2023,      \n       RSUs were valued using the grant       \n       price of $47.14 less the present       \n       value of future dividends of $6.21,    \n       or $40.93, consistent with the         \n       approach for FASB ASC Topic 718        \n       expensing. The RSUs granted on March   \n       3, 2023 were valued using the grant    \n       price of $46.24 less the present       \n       value of future dividends of $6.20,    \n       or $40.04, consistent with the         \n       approach for FASB ASC Topic 718        \n       expensing. At the maximum level of     \n       performance, the value of PSUs         \n       awarded in 2023 would be: $5,636,183   \n       for Mr.\u00a0Rogers, $1,482,554 for Mr.\u00a0    \n       Maguire, $2,753,296 for Mr.\u00a0Cummins,   \n       $1,916,732 for Mr.\u00a0Starnes and         \n  (2)  $1,560,588 for Mr.\u00a0Wilson. As          \n       discussed in the Compensation          \n       Discussion and Analysis, the           \n       outstanding PSUs and RSUs remain       \n       subject to vesting criteria and        \n       accordingly, the NEO may never         \n       receive any value from such award.     \n       For Mr.\u00a0Howard, the amounts in the     \n       \u201cStock Awards\u201d column reflect the      \n       grant date fair value of the           \n       profits-interest awards he received    \n       in TIH, calculated in accordance with  \n       FASB ASC Topic 718, including          \n       $3,078,303 of previously granted       \n       Truist long-term incentive awards      \n       converted into TIH profits-interest    \n       awards.

The profits interests   \n         granted in exchange for the          \n         outstanding Truist awards were made  \n         in two installments in May and       \n         December of 2023 to ensure           \n         alignment with the final valuation   \n         of the awards.                       \n                                              \nOption Exercises and Stock Vested in 2023 (1) \n                                 \n  Option Awards    Stock Awards  \n                                 \n                                              \n          Numb\u2026              Numb\u2026            \n             of     Value       of     Value  \n          Shar\u2026    Reali\u2026    Shar\u2026    Reali\u2026  \n  Name    Acqu\u2026        on    Acqu\u2026        on  \n             on    Exerc\u2026       on    Vesti\u2026  \n          Exer\u2026       ($)    Vest\u2026       ($)  \n            (#)                (#)            \n  Wil\u2026                                        \n  H.\u00a0         \u2014         \u2014    76,9\u2026    2,470\u2026  \n  Rog\u2026                                        \n  Jr.                                         \n  Mic\u2026                                        \n  B.          \u2014         \u2014    14,8\u2026    475,2\u2026  \n  Mag\u2026                                        \n  Hugh                                        \n  S.      55,9\u2026    1,560\u2026    54,0\u2026        1,  \n  Cum\u2026                                704,8\u2026  \n  III                                         \n  Cla\u2026                                        \n  R.          \u2014         \u2014    33,4\u2026    1,072\u2026  \n  Sta\u2026                                        \n  III                                         \n  Don\u2026                                        \n  L.          \u2014         \u2014    15,6\u2026    501,3\u2026  \n  Wil\u2026                                        \n  John                                        \n  M.          \u2014         \u2014    10,1\u2026    326,9\u2026  \n  How\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n         This table presents gross share      \n         amounts, without accounting for      \n  (1)    cashless exercises or shares         \n         withheld upon exercise for payment   \n         of taxes.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n         Based on the $32.10 closing price    \n         of Truist\u2019s common stock on March\u00a0   \n  (2)    15, 2023, $29.00 on September\u00a015,    \n         2023 and $32.14 on November\u00a030,      \n         2023, the dates of vesting.          \n                                              \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    69  \n                                \nCompensation of Executive Officers 2023       \nPension Benefits (1)                          \n                                              \n                   Numb\u2026    Pres\u2026    Pay\u2026     \n                      of    Value    Dur\u2026     \n  Name    Plan\u00a0    Years       of    Last     \n          Name\u2026    Cred\u2026    Accu\u2026    Fis\u2026     \n                   Serv\u2026    Bene\u2026    Year     \n                     (#)      ($)    ($)      \n  Wil\u2026                                        \n  H.

For a        \ndiscussion of the valuation methods and       \nmaterial assumptions applied in quantifying   \nthe present value of the current accrued      \nbenefit under each of these plans, as set     \nforth in the table above, please refer to Note\n15 \u201cBenefit Plans\u201d in the \u201cNotes to           \nConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d included   \nwith the Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the    \nyear ended December 31, 2023, and filed with  \nthe SEC on February 27, 2024. A discussion of \neach of these plans is set forth below.       \nMessrs. Rogers and Cummins participated in    \nplans assumed in the merger of equals with    \nSunTrust that created Truist. Those plans have\nprovisions which differ from the Truist plans \ndiscussed below. The Company merged the       \nSunTrust qualified pension plan into the      \nTruist Pension Plan in 2020. Mr. Rogers and   \nMr. Cummins continue to participate in the    \nSunTrust ERISA Excess Plan, and Mr. Rogers    \ncontinues to participate in the SunTrust      \nBanks, Inc. Tier 2 SERP, although any future  \nbenefit accruals will come only from the      \nTruist Pension Plan and Non-QualifiedDefined  \nBenefit Plan as benefit accruals under these  \nheritage SunTrust plans were frozen prior to  \nthe merger. Tax-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan.\nThe Pension Plan is a tax-qualifieddefined    \nbenefit pension plan for eligible teammates.  \nMost teammates of Truist and its subsidiaries \nwho have attained age 21 are eligible to      \nparticipate in the Pension Plan after         \ncompleting one year of service. Our           \ncontributions to the Pension Plan are computed\non an actuarial basis. No participant         \ncontributions are permitted. Except as        \ndescribed below for teammates hired or rehired\non or after January 1, 2024, a participant\u2019s  \nannual normal retirement benefit under the    \nPension Plan at age 65 is an amount equal to  \n1.0% of the participant\u2019s final average       \ncompensation plus 0.5% of the participant\u2019s   \nfinal average compensation in excess of Social\nSecurity covered compensation, multiplied by  \nthe number of years of creditable service     \ncompleted up to a maximum of 35 years. A      \nparticipant\u2019s final average compensation is   \nhis or her average annual cash compensation,  \nincluding salary, wages, overtime, bonuses and\nincentive compensation, for the five          \nconsecutive years in the last ten years in    \nwhich he or she receives compensation that    \nproduces the highest average. Effective       \nJanuary 1, 2024, the formula for the pension  \nplan was modified for new hires and rehires.  \nEach of those participant\u2019s annual normal     \nretirement benefit under the Pension Plan is  \nan amount equal to 0.94% of the participant\u2019s \nfinal average compensation plus               \n                                \n  70    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nCompensation of Executive Officers 0.47% of   \nthe participant\u2019s final average compensation  \nin excess of Social Security covered          \ncompensation multiplied by the number of years\nof creditable service completed up to a       \nmaximum of 35 years. The new formula requires \nthese participants to work two additional     \nyears in order to receive the same benefit as \nunder the formula for already existing        \nparticipants, in essence, moving full         \nretirement benefits to 67 years of age. Non-  \nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan.The Non-        \nQualifiedDefined Benefit Plan is an excess    \nbenefit plan designed to provide supplemental \npension benefits for certain highly           \ncompensated teammates, including the NEOs, to \nthe extent that their benefits under the      \nPension Plan are curtailed due to IRS         \ncompensation and benefit limitations. Benefits\nunder the Non-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan   \nare included in the table above.              \nRetirement.Messrs. Rogers, Cummins, Starnes   \nand Howard meet or have met the requirements  \nfor retirement under the Pension Plan and the \nNon-QualifiedDefined Benefit Plan. While the  \ngeneral retirement age is 65, teammates with  \nat least 10 years of service who have attained\nage 55 are eligible to retire and begin       \nreceiving a reduced pension immediately. If a \nteammate begins pension payments prior to the \nnormal retirement age of 65, the payments are \nreduced based on a plan-specified reduction   \nschedule ranging from receipt of 50% at age   \n55, increasing until reaching 98% at age 64,  \nwith the increases weighted more heavily      \ntoward the earlier years. Generally, pension  \nbenefits under each plan are paid to          \nqualifying participants in the form of a life \nannuity for non-marriedparticipants and a     \njoint and 50% survivor annuity for married    \nparticipants. 2023 Non-QualifiedDeferred      \nCompensation                                  \n                                              \n         Exe\u2026    Tru\u2026    Agg\u2026    Ag\u2026    Agg\u2026  \n         Con\u2026    Con\u2026    Ear\u2026    Wi\u2026    Bal\u2026  \n  Na\u2026      in      in      in    Di\u2026      at  \n         2023    2023    2023    ($)    12/\u2026  \n         ($)\u2026    ($)\u2026    ($)\u2026           ($)\u2026  \n  Wi\u2026                                         \n  H.     364\u2026    363\u2026    1,8\u2026      \u2014    8,6\u2026  \n  Ro\u2026                                         \n  Jr.                                         \n  Mi\u2026                                         \n  B.     102\u2026    95,\u2026    91,\u2026    28\u2026    570\u2026  \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  Hu\u2026                                         \n  S.     1,6\u2026    201\u2026    892\u2026      \u2014    7,0\u2026  \n  Cu\u2026                                         \n  III                                         \n  Cl\u2026                                         \n  R.     180\u2026    153\u2026    253\u2026      \u2014    4,7\u2026  \n  St\u2026                                         \n  III                                         \n  Do\u2026                                         \n  L.     114\u2026    108\u2026    157\u2026      \u2014    1,4\u2026  \n  Wi\u2026                                         \n  Jo\u2026                                         \n  M.     139\u2026    126\u2026    288\u2026      \u2014    3,1\u2026  \n  Ho\u2026                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n         Executive contributions were based   \n         on each NEO\u2019s deferral elections     \n  (1)    and the salaries, AIP award and/or   \n         LTIP payments received by each NEO   \n         in 2023.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         This column represents Truist\u2019s      \n         matching contributions credited to   \n         the accounts of the NEOs during      \n  (2)    2023 in respect of the NEO\u2019s         \n         contributions.

During 2023, eligible teammates  \nwere permitted to defer up to 50% of their    \ncash compensation under the Non-              \nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan, with      \ncertain participants, including each NEO,     \neligible to receive a matching contribution up\nto 6% of his or her compensation. All cash    \ncompensation is eligible for deferral unless  \nprohibited under Internal Revenue Code Section\n409A. Plan participants may select deemed     \ninvestment funds under the Non-               \nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan that are   \nidentical to the investment funds offered     \nunder the 401(k) Plan with the exception that \nno deemed investments in Truist common stock  \nare permitted. Participants make an election  \nupon entering the Non-QualifiedDefined        \nContribution Plan regarding the timing of plan\ndistributions. The two allowable distribution \nelections are distribution upon termination or\ndistribution based on a selected age following\ntermination not to exceed age 65. The Non-    \nQualifiedDefined Contribution Plan also allows\nfor an in-servicehardship withdrawal based on \nfacts and circumstances that meet IRS         \nguidelines. The Non-QualifiedDefined          \nContribution Plan also provides participants  \nin our incentive compensation plans with an   \neffective means of electing to defer, on a    \npre-taxbasis, a portion of the payments that  \nthey are entitled to receive under such plans.\n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    71  \n                                \nCompensation of Executive Officers Potential  \nPayments Upon Termination or Change of Control\nThe potential payments to the NEOs pursuant to\nexisting plans and arrangements in the event  \nof their termination or a change of control at\nDecember 31, 2023 are shown in the table      \nbelow. In December 2023, Truist amended and   \nrestated the Management Change of Control,    \nSeverance and Noncompetition Plan, originally \nadopted in July 2022, (the \u201cSeverance Plan\u201d), \nwhich covers executive officers, including    \neach of the NEOs, other than Mr. Howard.      \nSeveral of the important provisions of the    \nSeverance Plan are discussed below, including \nthe

Therefore, we    \n         have calculated these amounts using  \n         actual performance for the 2021      \n         LTIP and PSU awards and an           \n         assumption of target performance     \n         for both the 2022 and 2023 LTIP and  \n         PSU awards.

In the event of the death or         \ndisability, and subsequent termination, of any\nNEO, the Company and Truist Bank will use     \ntheir best efforts to accelerate vesting of   \nany unvested benefits to which the NEO may be \nentitled under any stock-based or other       \nbenefit plan or arrangement to the extent     \npermitted by the terms of such plans. The     \nSeverance Plan also includes a non-           \ncompetitionobligation applicable to           \nparticipants who have been designated by the  \nBoard as \u201cofficers\u201d within the meaning of Rule\n16a-1(f)promulgated under the Exchange Act    \n(\u201cSection 16 Officers\u201d), and for all          \nparticipants an obligation not to solicit     \nTruist teammates or clients, each obligation  \ncontinuing for 12 consecutive months after the\ndate of termination of employment. These      \nprohibitions generally preclude the Section 16\nOfficers (currently all NEOs participating in \nthe Severance Plan are Section 16 Officers)   \nfrom working for a direct competitor providing\nbanking or financial products or services     \nwithin the continental United States.         \nAdditionally, the nonsolicitation covenants   \nprohibit the participant from soliciting or   \nassisting in the solicitation of any recipient\nof the Company\u2019s banking or financial products\nor services and other Company clients or      \ninducing any of our teammates to terminate    \ntheir employment with the Company or its      \naffiliates. The Severance Plan also provides  \nfor a three month garden leave period for     \nparticipants who resign with or without good  \nreason. The participant must provide the      \nCompany with three months\u2019 advance written    \nnotice of his or her termination of           \nemployment, and during the three month garden \nleave period, he or she will remain employed  \nby Truist. The Severance Plan provides for    \nreductions in payments to the extent necessary\nto avoid exceeding the limits established by  \nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.    \nPayments in excess of these limits are often  \nreferred to as \u201cexcess parachute payments,\u201d   \nand exceeding the Section 280G limits         \ngenerally triggers an excise tax on the       \npayments. Under the Severance Plan, if        \ntermination payments and benefits to be       \nprovided (along with any other payments and   \nbenefits available to the NEO) will constitute\nan excess parachute payment, then the payments\nwill be reduced to an amount that is $1.00    \nless than the amount that would cause the     \npayments to be an excess parachute payment;   \nprovided, however, that such a reduction will \nonly be imposed if the reduction results in a \ngreater after-taxbenefit to the NEO than if   \nsuch payments had not been reduced.

In the event of  \nthe termination of his employment by reason   \nother than death, disability or reduction in  \nforce during the post-event vesting period,   \nall unvested event-vesting profits interests  \nwill be forfeited. If his employment is       \nterminated due to death, disability or        \nreduction in force during the post-event      \nvesting period, the unvested event-vesting    \nprofits interests will vest on a pro rata     \nbasis depending on the length of time that has\nelapsed from the date of grant to the date of \ntermination with 100% of such interests       \nvesting if the termination of employment      \noccurs four years or more after the grant     \ndate. Any vested event-vesting profits        \ninterests that are not cashed out in the      \napplicable transaction giving rise to vesting \nwill be subject to TIH\u2019s repurchase rights    \nupon termination of employment as described   \nbelow. If Mr. Howard\u2019s employment is          \nterminated for \u201ccause\u201d or if he breaches the  \nrestrictive covenants in the plan (as         \ndescribed below), all of his profits          \ninterests, whether vested or unvested, will be\nautomatically forfeited. If his employment is \nterminated for any reason other than \u201ccause,\u201d \nand he has not breached the restrictive       \ncovenants in the plan, TIH may elect to       \nrepurchase all or a portion of his vested     \nprofits interests at fair market value as of  \nthe time that the repurchase election is made.\nFor purposes of the profits-interests plan,   \n\u201cChange in Control\u201d means the first of the    \nfollowing events to occur after April 3, 2023:\n(i) any single transaction or series of       \nrelated transactions, where any one person    \n(other than the Investor Group) or more than  \none person acting in concert as a group,      \nacquires more than fifty percent (50%) of     \nTIH\u2019s voting power; (ii) any single           \ntransaction or series of related transactions \nwhere Truist holds less than fifty percent    \n(50%) of TIH\u2019s voting power, (iii) a merger,  \nconsolidation, or similar transaction         \ninvolving TIH or in which TIH\u2019s securities are\nissued unless TIH\u2019s pre-transactionequity     \nholders continue to own at least 50% of the   \nvoting power of TIH, its successor or ultimate\nparent company; or (iv) the sale or other     \ndisposition of all or substantially all of the\nassets of TIH and its subsidiaries on a       \nconsolidated basis; provided that if any award\nconstitutes \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d (as       \ndefined in Section 409A of the Internal       \nRevenue Code), no event shall constitute a    \nchange in control with respect to such award  \nif it does not also constitute a change in the\nownership or effective control of TIH, or in  \nthe ownership of a substantial portion of     \nTIH\u2019s assets (in either case, as defined in   \nSection 409A).

For 2023, Mr. Roger\u2019s annual    \ntotal compensation was $12,434,311 and the    \nmedian teammate\u2019s annual total compensation   \nwas $109,424. These amounts include the value \nof certain non-discriminatorybenefits. Based  \nupon this information, the ratio of the annual\ntotal compensation of our CEO to the median   \nteammate was 114 to 1. The CEO pay ratio rules\nallow us to use the same median teammate for  \ncomparison purposes for up to three years.    \nAlthough we identified a median teammate for  \n2022, we have decided to select a new median  \nteammate for 2023 due to changes in the       \nteammate population in connection with our    \ncost-savings program. For purposes of         \nidentifying our median teammate for 2023, we  \nexamined our teammate population, excluding   \nour CEO, as of December 31, 2023. As permitted\nby SEC rules, we excluded (i) 83 teammates    \nworking in Canada given the small number of   \nteammates in that jurisdiction, (ii) 10       \nteammates hired via various acquisitions of   \nother businesses during the year, and (iii)   \n454 teammates that were on unpaid leave of    \nabsence for all of 2023. The median teammate  \nwas determined by reviewing wages, tips and   \nother compensation on payroll records for our \nteammate population, as reported to the IRS on\nForm W-2. The pay ratio identified above is a \nreasonable estimate calculated in a manner    \nconsistent with SEC rules. Pay ratios that are\nreported by our peers may not be directly     \ncomparable to ours because of differences in  \nthe composition of each company\u2019s workforce,  \nas well as the assumptions and methodologies  \nused in calculating the pay ratio as permitted\nby SEC rules.                                 \n                                \n  78    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \n            Pay Versus Performance            \nAs required by SEC rules, we are providing the\nfollowing information about the relationship  \nbetween executive compensation actually paid  \nand certain financial performance of the      \nCompany.

Analysis of the\nInformation Presented in the Pay Versus       \nPerformance Table As described in more detail \nin the CD&A, the Company\u2019s executive          \ncompensation program reflects a pay-for-      \nperformancephilosophy. While the Company      \nutilizes several performance measures to align\nexecutive compensation with Company           \nperformance, all of those Company measures are\nnot presented in the PvP table set forth      \nabove. Moreover, the Company generally seeks  \nto incentivize long-term performance, and     \ntherefore does not specifically align the     \nCompany\u2019s performance measures with           \ncompensation that is actually paid (as        \ncomputed in accordance with Item 402(v) of    \nRegulation S-K)for a particular year. In      \naccordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation     \nS-K,the Company is providing the following    \ndescriptions of the relationships between     \ninformation presented in the PvP table.       \nCompensation Actually Paid and Cumulative TSR \nThe amount of compensation actually paid to   \nthe PEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as         \napplicable), and the average amount of        \ncompensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s   \nNEOs as a group (excluding Messrs. King and/or\nRogers, as applicable) is generally aligned   \nwith the Company\u2019s cumulative TSR over the    \nfour years presented in the table. The        \nalignment of compensation actually paid with  \nthe Company\u2019s cumulative TSR over the period  \npresented is primarily because a significant  \nportion of the compensation actually paid to  \nthe NEOs is comprised of equity awards. As    \ndescribed in more detail in the CD&A, as of   \nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 51% of the   \nvalue of total target compensation awarded to \nthe CEO and 44% of the value of total target  \ncompensation awarded to the other NEOs        \nconsists of equity awards, including RSU and  \nPSU awards. Compensation Actually Paid and Net\nIncome The amount of compensation actually    \npaid to the PEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as \napplicable), and the average amount of        \ncompensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s   \nNEOs as a group (excluding Messrs. King and/or\nRogers, as applicable) is generally           \nalignedwith the Company\u2019s net income over the \nfour years presented in the PvP table. While  \nthe Company does not use net income as a      \nperformance measure in the overall executive  \ncompensation program, the measure of net      \nincome is correlated with the performance     \nmeasures which the Company uses when setting  \ngoals in the Company\u2019s short-term and long-   \nterm incentive compensation plans, such as    \nEPS, PPNR and ROACE. Each of these measures is\ncalculated using net income as a component. As\ndescribed in more detail in the CD&A, as of   \nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 68% of the   \nvalue of total target compensation awarded to \nthe CEO and 67% of the value of total target  \ncompensation awarded to the other NEOs is     \nperformance-based pay largely dependent on    \nfinancial measures that are calculated using  \nnet income as a key element.                  \nCompensation Actually Paid and EPS            \nThe amount of compensation actually paid to   \nthe PEOs, Messrs. King and Rogers (as         \napplicable), and the average amount of        \ncompensation actually paid to the Company\u2019s   \nNEOs as a group (excluding Messrs. King and/or\nRogers, as applicable) is generally aligned   \nwith the Company\u2019s EPS over the four years    \npresented in the PvP table, although EPS      \nincreased slightly in 2023 while compensation \nactually paid decreased as discussed below.   \nFor purposes of our incentive compensation    \nplans, EPS is defined as the Company\u2019s net    \nincome available to common shareholders for   \nthe applicable year, adjusted for certain     \nunexpected or non-core                        \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    81  \n                                \nTable of Contents\nPay Versus Performance performance items as   \ndetermined by the Compensation and Human      \nCapital Committee, divided by the average     \nnumber of fully diluted common shares         \noutstanding during the year.EPS for purposes  \nof our incentive compensation plans is a non- \nGAAPfinancial measure. See Annex Afor a       \nreconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to  \nEPS as used in our incentive compensation     \nplans for 2023. While the Company uses        \nnumerous financial and non-                   \nfinancialperformance measures for the purpose \nof evaluating performance for the Company\u2019s   \ncompensation programs, the Company has        \ndetermined that EPS is the financial          \nperformance measure that, in the Company\u2019s    \nassessment, represents the most important     \nperformance measure (that is not otherwise    \nrequired to be disclosed in the PvP table)    \nused by the Company to link compensation      \nactually paid to the Company\u2019s NEOs, for the  \nmost recently completed fiscal year, to       \nCompany performance. The Company utilizes EPS \nwhen setting goals in the Company\u2019s AIP awards\nprogram with EPS weighted at 50% in           \ndetermining the payouts to the NEOs prior to  \n2023 and at 40% starting in 2023. As described\nin more detail in the CD&A, as of December 31,\n2023, approximately 24% of the value of total \ntarget compensation awarded to the CEO and 28%\nof the value of total target compensation     \nawarded to the other NEOs consists of amounts \ndetermined under the Company\u2019s AIP awards.    \nAlthough EPS as adjusted for incentive        \ncompensation purposes increased slightly in   \n2023, compensation actually paid decreased for\nthe year due to a number of factors, including\nadjusting the weighting of EPS in the         \nCompany\u2019s AIP awards program from 50% to 40%, \nfailing to achieve threshold performance for  \nPPNR (a new performance metric in the AIP     \nawards program for 2023), and the decrease in \nthe Company\u2019s stock price during 2023 causing \na large decline in the value of the           \nsignificant portion of NEO pay comprised of   \nequity awards. Cumulative TSR of the Company  \nand Cumulative TSR of the Peer Group The      \nCompany\u2019s cumulative TSR over the four-year   \nperiod presented in the PvP table was         \n-21.6%,while the cumulative TSR of the peer   \ngroup presented for this purpose, the KBW     \nNasdaq Bank Index, was -3.3%over the four     \nyears presented in the PvP table. The         \nCompany\u2019s cumulative TSR underperformed the   \npeer group over this period primarily due to  \nelevated merger-related costs, lower asset    \nsensitivity, higher unrealized losses in the  \nsecurities portfolio and slower growth        \nrelative to the peer group.

Both \u201cdirect and indirect \nlobbying\u201d and \u201cgrassroots lobbying            \ncommunications\u201d include efforts at the local, \nstate and federal levels. The report shall be \npresented to the Nominating and Governance    \nCommittee and posted on Truist\u2019s website.     \nSupporting Statement Full disclosure of       \nTruist\u2019s lobbying activities and expenditures \nis needed to assess whether Truist\u2019s lobbying \nis consistent with its expressed goals and    \nshareholders\u2019 interests. Truist spent $11     \nmillion from 2019 - 2022 on federal lobbying. \nThis does not include state lobbying, where   \nTruist also lobbies. Truist\u2019s lobbying over   \nthe debt ceiling has attracted scrutiny. 1    \nCompanies can give unlimited amounts to third \nparty groups that spend millions on lobbying  \nand undisclosed grassroots activity. 2Truist  \nfails to disclose its payments to trade       \nassociations and social welfare groups (SWGs),\nor the amounts used for lobbying, to          \nshareholders. Truist belongs to the American  \nBankers Association (ABA), Bank Policy        \nInstitute (BPI), Business Roundtable,         \nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets     \nAssociation and US Chamber of Commerce, which \ntogether spent $119 million on federal        \nlobbying for 2022. Truist\u2019s lack of disclosure\npresents reputational risks when its lobbying \ncontradicts company public positions. For     \nexample, Truist publicly supports addressing  \nclimate change, yet the Business Roundtable   \nopposed the Inflation Reduction Act, 3the     \nChamber reportedly has been a \u201ccentral actor\u201d \nin dissuading climate legislation over a two- \ndecadeperiod, 4and BPI lobbied the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to weaken proposed    \nclimate disclosure rules. 5A recent analysis  \nlooking at inconsistencies between banks\u2019     \npublic climate commitments and their direct   \nand indirect climate lobbying practices noted \nTruist failed to publicly support the         \nInflation Reduction Act. 6And while Truist    \ndoes not belong to or support the American    \nLegislative Exchange Council, which is        \nattacking \u201cwoke\u201d investing, 7its trade        \nassociations do, as the Chamber sits on its   \nPrivate Enterprise Advisory Council 8and ABA  \nsupported its 2022 annual meeting. 9          \nReputational damage stemming from these       \nmisalignments could harm shareholder value.   \nThus it will be a best practice for Truist to \nexpand its lobbying disclosure. 1             \nhttps://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-\ninfluence/2023/04/27/whos-lobbying-on-the-    \ndebit-ceiling-fight-00094301. 2               \nhttps://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business- \ngroup-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-  \nat-least-double-whats-publicly-reported/.     \nhttps://www.truist.com/content/dam/truist-    \nbank/us/en/documents/disclosures/non-         \nlob/truist-2022-tcfd.pdf 3 https://www.theguar\ndian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-      \nbusiness-lobby-group-climate-action-business- \nroundtable. 4 https://www.washingtonpost.com/p\nolitics/2023/08/02/climate-group-pushes-big-  \ntech-exit-nations-largest-business-lobby/. 5  \nhttps://www.eenews.net/articles/banks-to-sec- \nclimate-rule-poses-real-world-problems/. 6    \nhttps://www.ceres.org/news-center/press-      \nreIeases/new-benchmark-analysis-us-banks-     \nreveals-inconsistencies-between-cIimate. 7 htt\nps://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2023/03/22/ESG-  \ninvesting-fossil-fuels. 8 https://ohiocapitalj\nournal.com/2023/09/06/coming-soon-in-ohio-    \nalec-releases-new-raft-of-model-legislation/. \n9 https://documented.net/investigations/heres-\nwho-bankrolling-alec-2022-annual-meeting.     \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    83  \n                                \nProposal 4\u2014Shareholder Proposal Regarding An  \nAnnual Report on Lobbying Activities STATEMENT\nOF THE TRUIST BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN OPPOSITION\nTO THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL We agree that it  \nis important to participate in the political  \nprocess in a transparent manner. To promote   \ntransparency, we have a Statement of Political\nEngagement (available on our investor-        \nrelations website at https://ir.truist.com)   \nthat outlines the policies that govern        \nTruist\u2019s political involvement and            \ninteractions with public officials. We also   \npublish an annual political-contributions     \nreport disclosing the contributions made by   \nthe Truist-sponsored political action         \ncommittees (\u201cPACs\u201d)\u2014which are funded entirely \nby voluntary contributions from teammates,    \ndirectors, and advisory board members\u2014and our \nmajor trade-association memberships. We       \ndisclose as well a climate-lobbying summary   \nthat assesses how well the lobbying efforts of\nour major trade associations align with our   \nclimate goals and public statements on climate\nchange. We believe that these and other       \nexisting public disclosures already address   \nthe requests in the proposal that are most    \nrelevant and meaningful to Truist\u2019s public-   \npolicy advocacy, and the additional           \ninformation in the report requested through   \nthe proposal would impose operational burdens \nand expenses without adding material value for\nshareholders. As a result, we believe that the\nadoption of the proposal is unnecessary and   \nnot in the best interests of Truist and our   \nshareholders. We already provide transparency \nand publish lobbying disclosures. Due to the  \nconsiderable impact of public policies on     \nTruist and our strategy to create long-term   \nvalue for shareholders, we believe that       \nresponsible corporate citizenship requires    \nparticipation in the political and public-    \npolicy process under our democratic form of   \ngovernment. Our Statement of Political        \nEngagement provides a detailed description of \nthese political and lobbying activities. As   \ndescribed there, consistent with U.S. federal \nlaw, we do not use corporate funds to         \ncontribute to federal candidates, political   \nparties, or political committees or otherwise \nemploy our resources, including in-kind,even  \nwhen permitted by law. Further, we do not     \ncontribute corporate funds or make in-        \nkindcorporate contributions to state and local\npolitical candidates, political parties,      \ncommittees organized for the election of      \npolitical candidates, or 527 groups such as   \nso-calledsuper PACs. In compliance with       \napplicable law, however, we regularly do      \nexpress views on policy matters to elected    \nofficials and their staff as well as the      \nprincipals and staff of various regulatory    \norganizations through in-houseand outside     \nregistered lobbyists. We are also a member of \nseveral business and financial-services trade \nassociations and may seek to work with these  \norganizations to engage in policy debates on  \nissues of specific importance to us and       \nmatters of general concern for the financial- \nservices industry. In our annual political-   \ncontributions report, we voluntarily identify \neach U.S. trade association with membership   \ndues of $50,000 or more that we supported in  \nthe most recently completed fiscal year. We   \ncontinually evaluate potential enhancements to\nour public disclosures regarding our lobbying \nactivities, and in 2024, for example, we plan \nto add information regarding the portion of   \nmajor trade association dues attributable to  \nfederal lobbying expenses and disclosure of   \nany payments by Truist to support or oppose   \nballot initiatives during the prior calendar  \nyear. We already assess how well the lobbying \nefforts of our major trade associations align \nwith our climate goals and public statements  \non climate change. Our commitment to          \nsupporting the transition to a low-           \ncarboneconomy is clearly articulated in our   \nclimate-lobbying summary. Following our early \n2022 announcement of a net-zero-greenhouse-   \ngas-emissionsgoal by 2050, we developed a     \nmonitoring protocol to review the climate     \nlegislation, advocacy, and lobbying activity  \nof the principal trade associations we        \nsupport. The goal of these reviews is to      \nunderstand whether trade-association positions\nand activities align with important climate   \nmeasures, including the Paris Climate         \nAgreement, and whether trade-association      \npartners support our net-zerocommitments and  \nclimate initiatives. Through this assessment, \nwe concluded for our 2022 climate-lobbying    \nsummary (available on our investor relations  \nwebsite at https://ir.truist.com )that the    \nmajority of our major trade associations are  \naligned or partially aligned with our climate \ngoals. We plan to publish our next climate-   \nlobbying summary in conjunction with our      \nannual Corporate Responsibility Report in     \nApril 2024 and to continue closely monitoring \nand assessing future actions of our major     \ntrade associations. The Board oversees our    \npolitical and public-policy engagement. As    \nrequired by its charter, the Nominating and   \nGovernance Committee oversees the Company\u2019s   \npolicies and practices relating to political  \ncontributions and lobbying. As part of this   \noversight, the Nominating and Governance      \nCommittee reviews our disclosures and annually\nevaluates the funding, governance, advocacy   \ninitiatives and political contribution        \nactivities of the Truist-sponsored PACs and   \nTruist\u2019s expenditures relating to its major   \ntrade associations. * * * For these reasons,  \nour Board believes that the proposal is not in\nthe best interests of the Company and its     \nshareholders.                                 \n                                \n  84    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nProposal 5\u2014Shareholder Proposal Regarding A   \nReport on Board Oversight of Risks Related to \nDiscrimination The following proposal was     \nsubmitted by David Bahnsen, trustee of the    \nBahnsen Family Trust dated July 14, 2023, of  \n409 39th Street, Newport Beach, CA 92663. The \nBahnsen Family Trust owns approximately 629   \nshares of our common stock. The Company is not\nresponsible for the accuracy or content of the\nproposal and the supporting statement, which  \nappear in the form received from the          \nproponent. Our Board recommends that you vote \nAGAINST the proposal for the reasons set forth\nafter the proponent\u2019s supporting statement.   \nProposal 5 Financial institutions are         \nessential pillars of the marketplace. Because \nof their pivotal role in America\u2019s economy,   \nmany federal and state laws already prohibit  \nthem from discriminating against customers.   \nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights recognizes \nthat \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of    \nthought, conscience, and religion.\u201d 1These    \nguarantees are an important part of protecting\nevery American\u2019s right to free speech and free\nexercise of religion. As shareholders of      \nTruist, we believe it is essential for the    \ncompany to provide financial services on an   \nequal basis without regard to race, color,    \nreligion, sex, national origin, or social,    \npolitical, or religious views. We are         \nconcerned with recent evidence of religious   \nand political discrimination against customers\nby financial services companies, as seen in   \nrecent examples 2and the 2022 Statement on    \nDebanking and Free Speech. 3 Truist\u2019s         \ncharitable giving policy 4excludes faith-based\norganizations, from churches to other         \nreligious organizations. As noted in the 2023 \nViewpoint Diversity Score Business lndex,     \n5\u201ccharitable giving policies [ought not] bar  \nnonprofits from receiving support simply      \nbecause of their religious status.\u201d           \nFurthermore, as per the 1792 Exchange\u2019s report\n6on Truist (listing the bank as \u2018High Risk\u2019), \nTruist \u201cdoes not provide its employees with   \nprotections against viewpoint discrimination.\u201d\nThis lack of protection raises serious        \nconcerns as to the possibility of politicized \ndebanking, concerns which Truist\u2019s            \nshareholders have a right to have assuaged. As\nper the Index, almost two-thirdsof major      \nfinancial institutions feature overly vague   \nlanguage regarding what can trigger debanking \nof a client. As matters currently stand, with \nnonspecific language of risk (JP Morgan       \nChase), hate (Visa), and bigotry (Truist), the\nmajority of prominent financial institutions  \nhave no avenue to rectify any serious concerns\nabout bias. And concerns are growing. In early\n2023, shareholders called for Chase,          \nMastercard, PayPal, Capital One, and Charles  \nSchwab to assess whether they have adequate   \nsafeguards to prevent politicized de-banking. \n7Nineteen state attorneys general and fourteen\nstate financial officers specifically called  \nout Chase for their de-bankingof a non-       \nprofitcommitted to advancing religious freedom\nand demanded action from the company to show  \ngood faith in addressing these widespread     \nconcerns. 8In absence of clearer protocols,   \nTruist could be next. Increased transparency  \nin debanking is a critical element of Truist\u2019s\nbusiness purpose\u2013the responsibility to provide\nvalue for shareholders must take priority over\nthe kind of activist demands that ultimately  \njeopardize a business\u2019 profit models and erode\nshareholder trust. Resolved:Shareholders      \nrequest that Truist\u2019s Board of Directors      \nconduct an evaluation and issue a report      \nwithin the next year, at reasonable cost and  \nexcluding proprietary information and         \ndisclosure of anything that would constitute  \nan admission of pending litigation, evaluating\nhow it oversees risks related to              \ndiscrimination against individuals based on   \ntheir race, color, religion (including        \nreligious views), sex, national origin, or    \npolitical views, and whether such             \ndiscrimination may impact individuals\u2019        \nexercise of their constitutionally protected  \ncivil rights. 1 https://www.un.org/en/about-  \nus/universal-declaration-of-human-rights. 2   \nhttps://adflegal.org/press-release/bank-      \namerica-boots-charity-serving-impoverished-   \nugandans-under-vague-risk-tolerance.          \nhttps://www.newsweek.com/stop-troubling-trend-\npolitically-motivated-debanking-              \nopinion-1787639. https://www.dailymail.eo.uk/n\news/article-12314423/The-Coutts-Faragedossier-\nbank-admitted-ex-Ukip-leader-DID-meet-        \ncommercial-criteria-used-tweet-Ricky-         \nGervaistrans-joke-Novak-                      \nDjokovic-ties-decide-odds-position-inclusive- \norganisation.html;                            \nhttps://familycouncil.org/?p=25159 3 https://s\ntorage.googleapis.com/vds_storage/document/Sta\ntement%20on%20Debanking%20and%20Free%20Speech.\npdf. 4 https://www.truist.com/purpose/truist- \nfoundation/grant-application 5 https://www.vie\nwpointdiversityscore.org/news/how-they-scored-\ntruist 6                                      \nhttps://1792exchange.com/company/truist-      \nfinancial/                                    \n                                \n  2024 Proxy Statement\u2002|    85  \n                                \nProposal 5\u2014Shareholder Proposal Regarding A   \nReport on Board Oversight of Risks Related to \nDiscrimination STATEMENT OF THE TRUIST BOARD  \nOF DIRECTORS IN OPPOSITION TO THE SHAREHOLDER \nPROPOSAL Truist is proud of the rich diversity\nthat exists in the backgrounds, experiences,  \nperspectives, and views of its clients and    \nteammates, and we already evaluate and provide\npublic disclosure of the oversight of risks   \nrelated to discrimination against individuals.\nAs a result, the adoption of the proposal is  \nunnecessary and not in the best interests of  \nTruist or its shareholders. We already have   \nand regularly evaluate policies and processes \nfor overseeing risks related to discrimination\nagainst individuals. Truist is committed to   \nmeeting the banking needs of the communities  \nwe serve, and it is our policy not to         \ndiscriminate against any potential client or  \ncredit applicant on a prohibited basis,       \nincluding race, color, ethnicity, religion,   \nnational origin, sex/gender, sexual           \norientation, gender identity, military status,\ndisability, marital or familial status, or age\nconsistent with applicable law. It is also our\npolicy not to discriminate on the basis of the\ncurrent or prospective location of a          \ncustomer\u2019s residence or business location. The\nequal and fair treatment of all credit        \napplicants and existing and former clients in \nall aspects of a credit transaction, without  \nregard to any of the prohibited               \ncharacteristics referenced above, is an       \nintegral part of Truist\u2019s fundamental mission \nto help our clients achieve economic success  \nand financial security. In addition, we will  \nnot deny services to current or prospective   \nclients on the basis of the client\u2019s political\nopinions, speech or affiliations, or the      \nclient\u2019s religious beliefs, religious exercise\nor religious affiliations. Denying or limiting\nequal access to basic economic opportunities, \nsuch as home ownership or credit, to any      \nsegment of our communities is contrary to     \nTruist\u2019s core values. As part of our          \ncommitment to treating clients in a non-      \ndiscriminatorymanner, we deploy fair-lending  \ntraining to our branch, lending, and other    \nteammates on an annual basis. Complaints of   \ndiscrimination from clients\u2014including any     \nbased on religion\u2014are escalated to Truist\u2019s   \nFair and Responsible Banking Compliance Group \nfor review. In addition, Truist has a Bias    \nComplaint Review Team that includes members of\nlegal, ethics, fair banking, branch           \noperations, human resources, client advocacy, \ncorporate investigations, corporate security, \nand financial crimes. The Bias Complaint      \nReview Team reviews complaint reporting and   \ntrends and also attends escalation meetings to\nprovide guidance, action plans, and feedback  \nfor complaints. As described in the Truist    \nCode of Ethics (available on our investor-    \nrelations website at https://ir.truist.com),  \nTruist is also committed to treating teammates\nin a fair, non-discriminatory,and inclusive   \nmanner. As an equal-opportunity employer,     \nTruist\u2019s employment decisions must be based   \nupon individual qualifications and conduct    \nwithout regard to any protected               \nclassifications. Truist is committed to       \nrecruiting, hiring, compensating, training,   \ndisciplining, promoting, terminating, and     \nadministering all personnel actions and terms \nand privileges of employment in a non-        \ndiscriminatoryand non-retaliatorymanner. To   \ncreate a workplace environment that fosters   \ninclusivity and respect, Truist does not      \ntolerate bullying, harassment, abuse, or      \ndiscrimination. Harassment and discrimination \nof any kind, whether intentional or not, have \nno place in Truist\u2019s work environment. We     \nalready publicly report on the status and     \noutcomes of anti-discrimination efforts. The  \nanti-discrimination efforts associated with   \nour diversity, equity, and inclusion program  \nare already disclosed in existing publicly    \navailable reports, such as our Corporate      \nResponsibility Reports. These public reports  \nset forth our commitment to responsible sales \nand lending practices and the equal and fair  \ntreatment of credit applicants and existing   \nborrowers. They also provide an overview of   \nour programs and policies aimed at reinforcing\nan inclusive culture and building a diverse   \nworkforce. Our Board and its committees       \noversee risks related to discrimination       \nagainst individuals. Fair treatment of clients\nand teammates is part of the \u201ctone at the top\u201d\nset by our Board.

We may not\nbe able to address all such questions asked   \nduring the time allotted for questions during \nthe Annual Meeting and will focus on those    \nissues that appear to be of the greatest      \ninterest to shareholders. You may log into and\nattend the virtual Annual Meeting beginning at\n10:45 a.m. ET on April 23, 2024. The Annual   \nMeeting will begin promptly at 11:00 a.m. ET. \nIf you experience any technical difficulties  \nduring the meeting, please call               \n844-976-0738(U.S.) or                         \n303-562-9301(International) for assistance.   \nEven if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting,\nwe encourage you to vote your shares in       \nadvance online, or if you received or         \nrequested printed copies of the proxy         \nmaterials, by phone or by mail, to ensure that\nyour shares will be represented at the Annual \nMeeting. Shareholders who participate in the  \nAnnual Meeting virtually by way of the link   \nprovided above will be deemed to be present in\nperson, including for purposes of determining \na quorum. Please note that participation in   \nthe virtual Annual Meeting is subject to      \ncapacity limits of the virtual meeting        \nplatform provider and access to the meeting   \nwill be granted on a first-come, first-served \nbasis. Additional information regarding the   \nrules and procedures for participating in our \nAnnual Meeting will be provided in our meeting\nrules of conduct, which shareholders can view \nduring the meeting on the meeting website.    \nVotes Required, Non-Votes,Abstentions and     \nRevocations For the election of directors,    \neach director nominee must receive the        \naffirmative vote of a majority of votes cast  \nin order to be elected. Proposals 2 through 5 \nrequire the affirmative vote of a majority of \nvotes cast on each proposal. An affirmative   \nmajority of the votes cast means the number of\nvotes cast \u201cfor\u201d the applicable director or   \nproposal exceeds the number of votes cast     \n\u201cagainst\u201d the applicable director or proposal.\nA broker or other nominee may generally vote  \nyour shares without instruction on routine    \nmatters but not on non-routinematters. A      \nbroker \u201cnon-vote\u201doccurs when your broker      \nsubmits a proxy for your shares but does not  \nindicate a vote for a particular \u201cnon-        \nroutine\u201dproposal because your broker does not \nhave authority to vote on that proposal and   \nhas not received specific voting instructions \nfrom you. Brokers and other nominees who are  \nNew York Stock Exchange members are expected  \nto have discretionary voting power only for   \nProposal 2, the ratification of               \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent \nauditor, but not for any other proposals. As a\nresult, if you do not provide specific voting \ninstructions to your record holder, New York  \nStock Exchange rules will allow the record    \nholder to vote only on Proposal 2, and not on \nProposals 1 or 3-5.Broker non-votes,as well as\nabstentions, will be counted in the number of \nshares represented for purposes of determining\nwhether a quorum is present, but they will not\nbe counted as votes cast for or against any of\nthe proposals, and therefore will not affect  \nthe outcome of the vote. Holders of our common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights in \nthe election of directors. A proxy may be     \nrevoked by a shareholder at any time before it\nis exercised by submitting to the Corporate   \nSecretary of Truist an instrument revoking it,\nsubmitting a duly executed proxy bearing a    \nlater date (including a proxy given over the  \ninternet or by telephone), or by attending the\nvirtual Annual Meeting and electing to vote   \nusing the virtual platform. Even if you plan  \nto attend the virtual Annual Meeting, you are \nencouraged to vote your shares by proxy.      \nDelivering Proxy Materials We deliver proxy   \nmaterials primarily through the internet in   \naccordance with SEC rules. In addition to     \nreducing the amount of paper used in producing\nthe materials, this method lowers the costs   \nassociated with mailing the proxy materials to\nshareholders. Shareholders who own Truist     \ncommon shares directly and not through a bank,\nbroker or nominee (\u201crecord holders\u201d) will have\nproxy materials or the Notice of Internet     \nAvailability delivered directly to their      \nmailing address or electronically if they have\npreviously consented to delivery by email.    \nShareholders whose shares are held for them by\nbanks, brokers or other nominees (\u201cbeneficial \nholders\u201d) will have the proxy materials or the\nNotice of Internet Availability forwarded to  \nthem by the intermediary that holds the       \nshares.                                       \n                                \n  90    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nVoting and Other Information If you received  \nonly a Notice of Internet Availability by     \nmail, you will not receive a printed copy of  \nthe proxy materials unless you request a copy \nby following the instructions on the notice.  \nThe Notice of Internet Availability also      \ncontains instructions for accessing and       \nreviewing the proxy materials over the        \ninternet and provides directions for          \nsubmitting your vote over the internet. In    \naccordance with SEC rules, we sent proxy      \nmaterials or a Notice of Internet Availability\non or about March 11, 2024 to our shareholders\nof record as of the close of business on      \nFebruary 15, 2024. To reduce the expenses of  \ndelivering duplicate proxy materials to       \nshareholders, we rely on SEC rules that permit\nus to deliver only one set of applicable proxy\nmaterials to multiple shareholders who share  \nan address, unless we receive contrary        \ninstructions from any shareholder at that     \naddress. All shareholders sharing an address  \nwill continue to receive separate proxy cards \nbased on their registered ownership of Truist \ncommon stock. Any shareholder sharing an      \naddress who does not receive an individual    \nproxy statement, our 2023 Annual Report and   \nour Annual Report on Form 10-Kmay write or    \ncall Broadridge Investor Communication        \nSolutions, Inc., as specified below, and we   \nwill promptly deliver the materials at no     \ncost.

The forward-looking statements in this\nproxy statement are made as of the date of    \nthis proxy statement, unless otherwise        \nindicated, and Truist undertakes no obligation\nto revise or update any forward-looking       \nstatements, except to the extent required by  \napplicable law or regulation.                 \n                                \n  92    |\u20022024 Proxy Statement  \n                                \nAnnex A\u2014Non-GAAPFinancial Measures As         \npreviously described, for the purposes of     \nmeasuring Truist\u2019s performance under Truist\u2019s \ncompensation plans, the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee typically makes adjustments \nto Truist\u2019s GAAP results so that the          \nparticipants are compensated for Truist\u2019s core\nperformance. For 2023, the Compensation and   \nHuman Capital Committee made adjustments to   \nTruist\u2019s GAAP net income, as set forth in the \ntables below (\u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d).         \nTypically, the Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee adjusts Truist\u2019s GAAP net income for\ngains or losses on sales of businesses,       \nmerger-related and restructuring charges and  \nsimilar non-coreperformance items, on a pre-  \ntaxbasis, provided the adjustment is not      \nsolely a tax-relateditem. Results for 2023    \nalso included adjustments for unusual economic\nactivity, including deposit cost increases    \nbeyond expected levels, a significant         \nunplanned shift in deposit mix from           \nnoninterest bearing to interest bearing       \ndeposits, and higher than expected increases  \nin loan loss reserves in comparison to the    \nCompany\u2019s financial plan primarily driven by  \nconsideration of inflation and refinancing    \nrisk in a rising interest rate environment in \nthe wholesale portfolios. These adjustments   \nare made so that participants are compensated \nfor Truist\u2019s core performance in comparison to\nplanned levels and are neither penalized nor  \nrewarded for non-corecharges, unusual gains,  \nor similar non-coreevents. Senior management  \nalso uses these financial measures in         \nevaluating Truist\u2019s financial performance. To \nthe extent practicable, the Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee also makes similar    \nadjustments to the reported performance of    \npeer group members for awards that measure    \nTruist\u2019s performance relative to the peer     \ngroup. The adjustments for 2023 affect the AIP\nawards\u2019 performance metrics, EPS and PPNR, and\nthe three-year average ROACE and ROATCE for   \nLTIP and PSU purposes. Truist derives the     \nadjusted version of each of these performance \nmetrics from its Adjusted Net Income, which is\na non-GAAPfinancial measure, and accordingly, \neach of these adjusted financial measures is  \ndetermined by methods other than in accordance\nwith GAAP and are thus non-GAAPmetrics. The   \nadjusted EPS measure is calculated in the same\nmanner as its GAAP counterpart, except that   \nAdjusted Net Income for the applicable        \nperformance metric is substituted for its GAAP\ncounterpart in the calculation. The adjusted  \nPPNR measure is calculated in the same manner \nas its unadjusted counterpart, except that the\nadditional adjustments shown in the table     \nbelow are taken into account in the           \ncalculation.
