in\nTruist\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2022:\n\n\u2022 current and future economic and market\nconditions, such as the interest rate\nenvironment, including the replacement of\nLIBOR as an interest rate benchmark; U.S.\nfiscal debt, budget and tax matters;\ngeopolitical matters (including conflicts in\nthe Ukraine, Israel, and the Gaza Strip); and\nany slow down in global economic growth could\nresult in, among other things, slower deposit\nor asset growth, a deterioration in credit\nquality, or a reduced demand for credit,\ninsurance, or other services;\n\n\u2022 the monetary and fiscal policies of the\nfederal government and its agencies, including\nin response to higher inflation, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the economy and\nTruist\u2019s profitability;\n\n\u2022 regulatory and supervisory matters,\nlitigation, or other legal actions may result\nin, among other things, costs, fines,\npenalties, restrictions on Truist\u2019s business\nactivities, reputational harm, negative\npublicity, or other adverse consequences;\n\n\u2022 evolving legislative, accounting standards,\nregulatory and supervisory standards,\nincluding with respect to climate, deposit,\ncapital, liquidity, and long-term debt\nrequirements, which may become more stringent\nin light of recent turmoil in the banking\nindustry and results of regulatory\nexaminations, which may adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations;\n\n\u2022 increased scrutiny regarding Truist\u2019s\nconsumer sales practices, training practices,\nincentive compensation design, and governance\ncould damage its reputation and adversely\nimpact business and revenues;\n\n\u2022 Truist may be impacted by actual or\nperceived soundness of other financial\ninstitutions, including as a result of the\nfinancial or operational failure of a major\nfinancial institution, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a financial\ninstitution or its ability to fulfill its\nobligations, which can cause substantial and\ncascading disruption within the financial\nmarkets and increased expenses, including FDIC\ninsurance premiums, and could affect our\nability to attract and retain depositors and\nto borrow or raise capital;\n\n\u2022 Truist is subject to credit risk by lending\nor committing to lend money, may have more\ncredit risk and higher credit losses to the\nextent that loans are concentrated by loan\ntype, industry segment, borrower type or\nlocation of the borrower or collateral, and\nmay suffer losses if the value of collateral\ndeclines in stressed market conditions;\n\n\u2022 inability to access short-term funding or\nliquidity, loss of client deposits, or changes\nin Truist\u2019s credit ratings could increase the\ncost of funding, limit access to capital\nmarkets, or negatively affect Truist\u2019s overall\nliquidity or capitalization;\n\n\u2022 unexpected outflows of uninsured deposits\nmay require Truist to sell investment\nsecurities at a loss;\n\n\u2022 a loss of value of Truist\u2019s investment\nportfolio could negatively impact market\nperceptions of Truist and could lead to\ndeposit withdrawals;\n\n\u2022 risk management oversight functions may not\nidentify or address risks adequately, and\nmanagement may not be able to effectively\nmanage credit risk;\n\n\u2022 there are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in Truist\u2019s business, which may\nimpact decisions made by management and\nregulators;\n\n\u2022 deposit attrition, client loss, or revenue\nloss following completed mergers or\nacquisitions may be greater than anticipated;\n\n\u2022 Truist could fail to execute on

financial resources or be subject to\ndifferent regulatory standards or compliance\ncosts, and (ii) products and services offered\nby non-bank financial technology companies,\nwhich may reduce Truist\u2019s client base, cause\nTruist to lower prices for its products and\nservices in order to maintain market share or\notherwise adversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses\nor results of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services, and technology, whether we\nfail to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause our technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public opinion could damage\nTruist\u2019s reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues, including the effects\nof social media on market perceptions of\nTruist and banks generally;\n\n\u2022 Truist faces substantial legal and\noperational risks in safeguarding personal\ninformation;\n\n\u2022 accounting policies and processes require\nmanagement to make estimates about matters\nthat are uncertain, including the potential\nwrite down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of time\nor if there is a decline in a reporting unit\u2019s\nforecasted net income;\n\n\u2022 Truist faces risks related to originating\nand selling mortgages, including repurchase\nand indemnity demands from purchasers related\nto representations and warranties on loans\nsold, which could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 there are risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as\na loan servicer, including an increase in the\nscope or costs of the services Truist is\nrequired to perform without any corresponding\nincrease in servicing fees or a breach of\nTruist\u2019s obligations as servicer;\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s success depends on hiring and\nretaining key teammates, and if these\nindividuals leave or change roles without\neffective replacements, Truist\u2019s operations\ncould be adversely impacted, which could be\nexacerbated in the increased work-from-home\nenvironment as job markets may be less\nconstrained by physical geography;\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s operations rely on its ability, and\nthe ability of key external parties, to\nmaintain appropriate-staffed workforces, and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health and\nsafety of teammates;\n\n\u2022 Truist faces the risk of fraud or misconduct\nby internal or external

preferences, could have\nan adverse effect on Truist\u2019s financial\ncondition and results of operations, lead to\nmaterial disruption of Truist\u2019s operations or\nthe ability or willingness of clients to\naccess Truist\u2019s products and services; and\n\n\u2022 the effects of COVID-19 adversely impacted\nthe Company\u2019s operations and financial\nperformance and similar adverse

Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company\nupdated its accounting policies in connection\nwith recently adopted accounting standards,\nwhich are described in this footnote. There\nwere no other significant changes to the\nCompany\u2019s accounting policies from those\ndisclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 that\ncould have a material effect on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial statements.\nReclassifications\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, Truist\nreclassified certain portfolios within the\nconsumer portfolio segment to delineate home\nequity from other consumer portfolios.\nAdditionally, Truist realigned Prime Rate\nPremium Finance Corporation, which includes\nAFCO Credit Corporation and CAFO Holding\nCompany, into the C&CB segment from the IH\nsegment. Prior period results have been\nrevised to conform to the current\npresentation.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, Truist\nupdated its segment cost allocation\nmethodology. Results for the first quarter of\n2023 have been revised to conform to the\ncurrent presentation. Management concluded the\nimpact to 2022 was not material.\nCertain other amounts reported in prior\nperiods\u2019 consolidated financial statements\nhave been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent presentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nLoan Modifications\nIn certain circumstances, the Company enters\ninto agreements to modify the terms of loans\nto borrowers that are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The scope of these loan\nmodifications varies from portfolio to\nportfolio but generally falls into one of the\nfollowing categories:\n\u2022 Renewals: represent the renewal of a loan\nwhere the Company has concluded that the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nCommercial renewals result in an extension of\nthe maturity date of the loan (or in some\ncases a contraction of the loan term), and\nother significant terms of the loan (e.g.,\ninterest rate, collateral, guarantor support,\netc.) are re-evaluated in connection with the\nrenewal event.\n\u2022 Term extensions: represent an adjustment to\nthe maturity date of the loan that typically\nresults in a reduction to the borrower\u2019s\nscheduled payment over the remainder of the\nloan.\n\u2022 Capitalizations: represents the\ncapitalization of forborne loan payments\nand/or other amounts advanced on behalf of the\nborrower into the principal balance of a\nresidential mortgage loan.\n\u2022 Payment delays: provide the borrower with a\ntemporary postponement of loan payments that\nis considered other-than-insignificant, which\nhas been defined as a payment delay that\nexceeds 90 days, or three payment cycles, over\na rolling 12-month period. These postponed\nloan payments may result in an extension of\nthe ultimate maturity date of the loan or may\nbe capitalized into the principal balance of\nthe loan in certain circumstances.\n\u2022 Combinations: in certain circumstances more\nthan one type of a modification is provided to\na borrower (e.g., interest rate reduction and\nterm extension).\n\u2022 Other: represents other types of loan\nmodifications that are not considered\nsignificant for disclosure purposes.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nThe Company has identified borrowers that are\nincluded in the Loan Modifications disclosures\nin \u201cNote 5. Loans and ACL\u201d as follows:\n\n\u2022 Commercial: the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of loans to commercial borrowers\nthat are rated substandard or worse and\nincludes the modifications in its disclosure\nto the extent that the modification is\nconsidered other-than-insignificant.\n\n\u2022 Consumer and credit card: loan modifications\nto consumer and credit card borrowers are\ngenerally limited to borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty. As a\nresult, the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of consumer and credit card\nloans and includes them in the disclosure to\nthe extent that they are considered other-than\ninsignificant.\n\nRefer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 for\naccounting policies related to prior period,\nincluding the Company\u2019s TDR policies.\nALLL\nThe ALLL represents management\u2019s best estimate\nof expected future credit losses related to\nits loan and lease portfolio at the balance\nsheet date. The Company\u2019s ALLL estimation\nprocess gives consideration to relevant\navailable information from internal and\nexternal sources relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The quantitative models\nused to forecast expected credit losses use\nportfolio balances, macroeconomic forecast\ndata, portfolio composition and loan\nattributes as the primary inputs. Loss\nestimates are informed by historical loss\nexperience that includes losses incurred on\nloans that were previously modified by the\nCompany. As a result, the Company has\nconcluded that aside from the limited\ncircumstances where principal forgiveness is\ngranted to a borrower, the financial effect of\nloan modifications is already inherently\nincluded in the ALLL.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified tax credit investments. In\ncomputing the provision for income taxes, the\nCompany evaluates the technical merits of its\nincome tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The proportional amortization method\nof accounting is used on affordable housing\nand other qualified tax credit investments,\nsuch that the initial cost of the investment\ngiving rise to tax credits is amortized in\nproportion to the allocation of tax credits in\neach period as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes.

Business Combinations, Divestitures,\nand Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNoncontrolling Interest\n\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company completed its\nsale of a 20% stake of the common equity in\nIH, which was previously wholly owned by\nTruist, to an investor group led by Stone\nPoint Capital, LLC for $ 1.9billion, with the\nproceeds, net of tax, recognized as an\nincrease to shareholders\u2019 equity. In\nconnection with the transaction, the\nnoncontrolling interest holder received\nprofits interest representing 3.75% coverage\non IH\u2019s fully diluted equity value at\ntransaction close, and certain consent and\nexit rights commensurate with a noncontrolling\ninvestor. Including these profits interests,\nthe noncontrolling interest holder is\nallocated approximately 23% of IH pretax net\nincome. The transaction allows Truist to\nmaintain strategic flexibility and future\nupside in IH, which will continue to benefit\nfrom Truist\u2019s operations, access to capital,\nand client relationships, while creating\nadditional opportunities for the growth of IH\nthrough the support of a strong blue-chip\ninvestor in Stone Point Capital, LLC. Also in\nconjunction with the same transaction, IH\ngranted certain event-vested profits interests\nand appreciation units, representing 4.50%\ncoverage on IH\u2019s fully diluted equity value at\ngrant, to various IH employees and officers in\nthe second quarter of 2023. These awards,\nsubject to continued employment through the\napplicable event or date, will vest either\nupon, or from 6 months to two years following,\na change in control of IH, depending on the\nnature of the change in control. No\ncompensation expense is recognized for these\nevent-vested awards until such an event is\nprobable. The Company intends these awards to\nstrengthen IH\u2019s ability to incent and retain\ntop talent, and realize IH\u2019s full potential.\n                                              \n  NOTE 3.

Charge-\noffs include $ 98million related to the sale.\n\nThe commercial ALLL increased $ 74million and\n$ 442million and the consumer ALLL increased $\n4million and decreased $ 140million during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respectively. The increase in the\ncommercial ALLL primarily reflects an increase\nin reserves related to the CRE and commercial\nconstruction portfolios. The slight increase\nin the consumer ALLL compared to the prior\nquarter reflects loan growth in certain\nindirect consumer portfolios, offset by run-\noff primarily in indirect auto and residential\nmortgage. The decrease in the consumer ALLL\nfor the year-to-date period primarily reflects\nthe sale of the student portfolio in the\nsecond quarter as well as impacts associated\nwith the adoption of the Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosure\naccounting standard in the first quarter of\n2023.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nU.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nrental rates, property values, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the September 30, 2023 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2022. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, each\nforecast scenario reflected deterioration in\ncertain economic variables over the reasonable\nand supportable forecast period when compared\nto the prior period. The overall economic\nforecast shaping the ACL estimate at September\n30, 2023 included GDP growth in the low-single\ndigits and an unemployment rate near mid-\nsingle digits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The September\n30, 2023 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

The Company considered such declines in\nthe context of industry related factors,\nincluding a decline in bank share prices,\nconcluding that a triggering event had\noccurred for its CB&W and C&CB reporting\nunits, and therefore Truist performed a\nquantitative test for these reporting units as\nof August 1, 2023. Based on the results of the\nimpairment analyses, the Company concluded\nthat the fair values of the reporting units\nexceed their respective carrying values;\ntherefore, there was no goodwill impairment.\nHowever, for the CB&W, and C&CB reporting\nunits, the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value by less than 10%,\nindicating that the goodwill of these\nreporting units may be at risk of impairment.\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from August 1, 2023 through\nSeptember 30, 2023, including macroeconomic\nand market factors, industry and banking\nsector events, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nAugust 1, 2023 quantitative impairment test,\nand the sensitivity of the August 1, 2023\nquantitative test results to changes in\nassumptions through September 30, 2023. Based\non these considerations, the Company concluded\nthat it was not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of one or more of its reporting\nunits is below its respective carrying amount\nas of September 30, 2023.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third-party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change. The\nfollowing table provides a summary of the TRS\ntransactions with VIE purchases.

The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets, and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

The matters range from\nindividual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with many\nclass members and can involve claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate alleged damages\nor for injunctive or other relief.\nInvestigations may involve both formal and\ninformal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations,\nand could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, and/or alterations in Truist\u2019s\nbusiness practices. These legal proceedings\nare at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, or investigation and may consist\nof a variety of claims, including common law\ntort and contract claims, as well as statutory\nantitrust, securities, and consumer protection\nclaims. The ultimate resolution of any\nproceeding and the timing of such resolution\nis uncertain and inherently difficult to\npredict. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of September 30,\n2023. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company deemed the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nwill change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses are based upon currently available\ninformation and involve considerable judgment,\ngiven that claims often include significant\nlegal uncertainties, damages alleged by\nplaintiffs are often unspecified or\noverstated, discovery may not have started or\nmay not be complete, and material facts may be\ndisputed or unsubstantiated, among other\nfactors.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the case\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. Such matters are not\naccrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint\nasserts claims for violations of civil and\ncriminal usury laws, conversion, and money had\nand received, and seeks damages on a class-\nwide basis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. On\nbehalf of the certified class as currently\ndefined, Plaintiff seeks a return of up to $\n452million in paid overdraft fees from the\n2006 to 2017 period above, plus prejudgment\ninterest. Truist intends to file motions to\namend the class definition to narrow the scope\nof the class, to compel arbitration against\ncertain class members, and for summary\njudgment by the current dispositive motion\ndeadline of October 31, 2023. Trial is\npresently set to commence on April 29, 2024.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has\nsubstantial defenses against the underlying\nclaims.\n\nUnited Services Automobile Association v.\nTruist Bank\n\nUSAA filed a lawsuit on July 29, 2022 against\nthe Company in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas\nalleging that the Company\u2019s mobile remote\ndeposit capture (\u201cRDC\u201d) systems infringed\nthree patents held by USAA. The complaint\nsought damages, including for alleged willful\ninfringement and a corresponding request that\nthe amount of actual damages be trebled, as\nwell as injunctive and other equitable relief.\nUSAA later amended its complaint to assert two\nadditional RDC patents in the lawsuit. The\nCompany filed its answer and affirmative\ndefenses on October 11, 2022, denying that it\ninfringed any of the patents at issue in the\nlawsuit and asserting that USAA\u2019s patents were\ninvalid or unenforceable. The Company further\nasserted counterclaims seeking damages as well\nas injunctive relief against USAA for\ninfringing six patents owned by the Company\nand practiced by USAA\u2019s mobile RDC systems.\nThe Company also filed petitions for inter\npartes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) at the Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board challenging the validity of each\nof the five patents asserted by USAA in the\nlawsuit, and review was granted for two of the\npatents and denied for one of the patents.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nEffective September 29, 2023, the Company and\nUSAA entered into a Settlement and Patent\nLicense Agreement resolving the lawsuit. The\nlawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on\nOctober 10, 2023, and the Company\u2019s pending\nIPR proceedings regarding USAA\u2019s RDC patents\nhave been terminated. The financial impact of\nthe resolution did not have a material adverse\neffect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or\noperating results.\n\nRecordkeeping Matters\n\nThe SEC and CFTC have requested information\nfrom various subsidiaries of the Company that\nconduct broker-dealer, investment adviser, and\nswap dealer activities regarding compliance\nwith applicable recordkeeping requirements for\nbusiness-related electronic communications.\nThe Company is cooperating with these\nrequests. The SEC and CFTC have been\nconducting similar investigations of other\nfinancial institutions regarding business-\nrelated communications sent over unapproved\nelectronic messaging channels and have entered\ninto a number of resolutions with various\ninstitutions to date.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the FDIC\nissued a proposed rule to impose a special\nassessment to recover the losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund following the recent\nbank failures. The assessment would be based\non an insured depository institution\u2019s\nestimated uninsured deposits reported as of\nDecember 31, 2022. If the final rule is\nadopted as proposed, the special assessment\nfor Truist is estimated at approximately $\n460million to be recognized at the time the\nrule is finalized and paid in eight quarterly\ninstallments beginning in the first quarter of\n2024. The actual assessment may vary as a\nresult of the final rule, including any\nchanges to the calculation methodology.\nAdditionally, the FDIC would have the ability\nto cease collection early, extend the\ncollection period to collect any difference\nbetween the estimated and actual losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund, and impose a final\nshortfall assessment on a one-time basis.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

Company\u2019s corporate and\ninvestment banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At September 30,\n2023, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 14 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  (Dollars

The Company\nelected not to restate prior periods for this\nchange based on IH\u2019s previous status as a\ncorporate entity. The Company recognized $\n30million and $ 84million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively, of tax provision related to IH\nin OT&C. In the third quarter of 2023, IH\nrecognized $ 3million of taxes for certain\nstate jurisdictions that impose income taxes\non partnerships and LLCs.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 43\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n44 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. The\ndescriptions below summarize certain updates\nsince the filing of the Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 to\nstate and federal laws to which Truist is\nsubject. These descriptions do not summarize\nall possible or proposed changes in current\nlaws or regulations and are not intended to be\na substitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions. Refer to Truist\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional disclosures.\n\nIn March 2023, the FRB created the Bank Term\nFunding Program to support American businesses\nand households by making additional funding\navailable to eligible depository institutions.\nThis program offers loans up to one year in\nlength to banks, savings associations, credit\nunions, and other eligible depository\ninstitutions pledging any collateral eligible\nfor purchase by the FRB in open market\noperations, such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S.\nagency securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-\nbacked securities. These assets are valued at\npar.\n\nIn July 2023, the SEC finalized rules\nrequiring registrants to disclose material\ncybersecurity incidents that they experience\non Form 8-K and to disclose on an annual basis\nmaterial information regarding their\ncybersecurity risk management, strategy, and\ngovernance. Annual disclosures will be\nrequired in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended 2023. The Form 8-K\ndisclosure requirements will become effective\nbeginning on December 18, 2023.\n\nBanking agencies have proposed certain actions\ndescribed below. We continue to evaluate these\nproposals and the potential impacts, if\nadopted as proposed, on the Company and Truist\nBank.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators\nissued a proposal to revise the risk-based\ncapital standards applicable to the Company\nand Truist Bank. This proposal would introduce\nnew approaches for credit risk, operational\nrisk, market risk and credit valuation\nadjustment risk that generally align with the\napproaches for these risks under the global\nBasel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee.\nThe proposal would introduce a new measure of\nrisk-weighted assets, which would reflect the\nproposed new standardized approaches for\ncredit risk, operational risk and credit\nvaluation adjustment risk, as well as a\nproposed new measure for market risk that\nwould be based on both internal models and\nstandardized supervisory models of market\nrisk. The proposal includes a proposed\neffective date of July 1, 2025, subject to a\nthree-year transition period ending July 1,\n2028, over which the expanded total risk-\nweighted assets would be phased in.\n\nIn August 2023, the U.S. banking regulators\nproposed a rule that would require banking\norganizations with $100 billion or more in\ntotal assets to comply with long-term debt\nrequirements and clean holding company\nrequirements that currently apply only to\nglobal systemically important banking\norganizations. This proposal would also impose\na long-term debt requirement on certain\ncategories of insured depository institutions\nthat are not consolidated subsidiaries of U.S.\nGSIBs, including insured depository\ninstitutions with $100 billion or more in\ntotal assets, such as Truist Bank. If adopted,\nthis proposal would require the Company and\nTruist Bank to each maintain a minimum\noutstanding eligible long-term debt amount of\nno less than the greatest of (i) 6% of risk-\nweighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage\nexposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total\nconsolidated assets. Truist Bank would be\nrequired to issue the minimum amount of\neligible long-term debt to the Company, and\nthe Company would be required to issue the\nminimum amount of eligible long-term debt\nexternally. In addition, if adopted as\nproposed, the clean holding company\nrequirement would limit or prohibit the\nCompany from entering into certain\ntransactions that could impede its orderly\nresolution, including, for example,\nprohibiting the Company from entering into\ntransactions that could spread losses to\nsubsidiaries and third parties, as well as\nlimiting the amount of the Company\u2019s\nliabilities that are not eligible long-term\ndebt.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 45\nIn August 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal to\namend its rules requiring covered insured\ndepository institutions, including Truist\nBank, to periodically submit resolution plans\nto the FDIC. If adopted as proposed, Truist\nBank would be required to submit a full\nresolution plan to the FDIC every two years\nand submit an interim supplement in each year\nthat it is not required to submit a full\nresolution plan. In addition, this proposal\nwould increase the content requirements for\nplan submissions and introduce a new\ncredibility standard for the FDIC\u2019s evaluation\nof resolution plans, which would be\nenforceable against the covered insured\ndepository institutions. Separately, the FRB\nand FDIC also proposed updated guidance on\nresolution planning requirements applicable to\nthe Company under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-\nFrank Act.\n\nIn addition, the FDIC proposed a special\nassessment to repay losses to the FDIC\u2019s\nDeposit Insurance Fund. If the final rule is\nadopted as proposed, the special assessment\nfor Truist is estimated at approximately $460\nmillion to be recognized at the time the rule\nis finalized and paid in eight quarterly\ninstallments beginning in the first quarter of\n2024. Refer to the \u201cNote 14. Commitments and\nContingencies\u201d for additional information\nrelated to the FDIC\u2019s special assessments.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nThe transformative work we announced in the\nthird quarter to improve our financial\nperformance is well underway. We are driving\nswift and meaningful actions to simplify our\norganization and reduce expenses. Our\ncontinued focus on core clients, paring back\nnon-core and lower-return portfolios, and\npaying down higher-cost borrowings has made\nour balance sheet more efficient and helped\ndrive a modest improvement in our net interest\nmargin.\n\nNoninterest expense was flat compared to the\nsecond quarter, and down 50 basis points on an\nadjusted basis, reflecting our expense\ndiscipline. Our $750 million gross cost saves\nprogram and efforts to simplify the\norganization are underway and we are focused\non expense discipline while also investing in\nour core franchise and risk management\nsystems.\n\nOur cost save program includes:\n\n\u2022 Reductions in force\n\n\u25e6 Spans and layers\n\n\u25e6 Consolidation of redundant/similar functions\n\n\u25e6 Select business restructuring\n\n\u25e6 Geographic simplification\n\n\u2022 Organizational alignment and simplification\n\n\u25e6 Consolidate businesses for operational\nefficiency\n\n\u25e6 More efficient branch network and staffing\nstructure\n\n\u25e6 Simplified and streamlined compensation and\nbenefits programs\n\n\u25e6 Reallocate investments to core businesses\n\n\u2022 Rationalize technology spend\n\n\u25e6 Focus on opportunities in core businesses\n\nWe remain strongly committed to improving our\ncapital position, which increased 29 basis\npoints in the third quarter. Asset quality\ncontinues to normalize but remains in-line\nwith our expectations and allowance coverage\nratios.\n\nAs we continue to diligently execute on this\ncritical work to capitalize on our competitive\nadvantages and drive efficiencies, we are\nfundamentally changing how we operate to drive\nrevenue growth, franchise value and increased\nbenefit to our shareholders, now and into the\nfuture.\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Truist announced changes\nto its Board of Directors. On December 31,\n2023, the retirements of directors Kelly S.\nKing, Nido R. Qubein, David M. Ratcliffe and\nThomas N. Thompson will occur due to these\ndirectors reaching Truist\u2019s mandatory\nretirement age. In addition, Board members\nAnna R. Cablik, Paul D. Donahue, Easter A.\nMaynard and Frank P. Scruggs, Jr. notified\nTruist on September 26, 2023, that they have\nchosen to conclude their service as directors\neffective as of December 31, 2023. Their\ndecisions are to address other professional\nand personal commitments and are not due to\nany disagreement with Truist on any matter\nrelating to Truist\u2019s operations, policies or\npractices. The Board and Truist\u2019s management\nexpress their deep appreciation to these\ndirectors for their dedicated service and many\nsignificant contributions to Truist.\n\n46 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Financial Results                           \n                                              \nNet income available to common shareholders\nfor the third quarter of 2023 of $1.1 billion\nwas down 30% compared with the third quarter\nof 2022. On a diluted per common share basis,\nearnings for the third quarter of 2023 were\n$0.80, a decrease of $0.35, or 30%, compared\nto the third quarter of 2022. Truist\u2019s results\nof operations for the third quarter of 2023\nproduced an annualized return on average\nassets of 0.86% and an annualized return on\naverage common shareholders\u2019 equity of 7.5%\ncompared to prior year returns of 1.19% and\n10.7%, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Results for the third quarter of 2023\nincluded merger-related and restructuring\ncharges of $75 million ($58 million after-tax,\nor $0.04 per share).\n\n\u2022 Results for the third quarter of 2022\nincluded $62 million ($48 million after-tax,\nor $0.04 per share) of merger-related and\nrestructuring charges and $90 million ($69\nmillion after-tax, or $0.05 per share) of\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger.\n\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nthird quarter of 2023 was down $162 million,\nor 4.3%, compared to the third quarter of 2022\nprimarily due to higher funding costs and\nlower purchase accounting accretion, partially\noffset by higher market interest rates. Net\ninterest margin was 2.95%, down 17 basis\npoints.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the total loan portfolio was\n6.25%, up 176 basis points, primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion. The yield on the average securities\nportfolio was 2.26%, up 31 basis points\nprimarily due to the higher rate environment.\nAverage deposits decreased $19.1 billion, or\n4.5%, average short-term borrowings increased\n$7.5 billion, and average long-term debt\nincreased $12.0 billion.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was\n1.81%, up 150 basis points. The average cost\nof short-term borrowings was 5.47%, up 313\nbasis points. The average cost of long-term\ndebt was 4.51%, up 208 basis points. The\nincrease in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nNoninterest income was relatively stable\ncompared to the third quarter of 2022 due to\nhigher other income and insurance income,\npartially offset by lower service charges on\ndeposits and lower investment banking and\ntrading income. Service charges on deposits\ninclude an $87 million reduction due to client\nrefund accruals resulting from a revision in\ndeposit service fee protocols.\n\nNoninterest expense was up $134 million, or\n3.7%, compared to the third quarter of 2022\ndue to higher personnel expense, other\nexpense, and regulatory costs, partially\noffset by lower professional fees and outside\nprocessing, marketing and customer\ndevelopment, and equipment expenses. Merger-\nrelated costs, which included merger-related\nand restructuring charges, as well as\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nmerger, decreased $77 million, primarily due\nto the completion of integration-related\nactivities. Adjusted noninterest expenses,\nwhich exclude merger-related costs, the\namortization of intangibles, and gains and\nlosses on the early extinguishment of debt,\nincreased $221 million, or 6.7%, and includes\nthe impact of $70 million of higher other\nexpenses due to costs associated with the\nchange to the deposit service fee protocols\nand resolution of certain legal matters.\n\nThe effective tax rate decreased compared to\nthe third quarter of 2022 primarily driven by\ndecreases in the full year forecasted\neffective tax rate, partially offset by\nchanges in discrete tax items.\n\nAn increase in the loan loss reserve reflects\nnormalization of asset quality.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment were 0.46% of loans and leases held\nfor investment at September 30, 2023, down one\nbasis point compared to June 30, 2023.\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses was $5.0\nbillion and includes $4.7 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $277\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.49%, up six\nbasis points compared with June 30, 2023.\n\n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $497\nmillion compared to $234 million for the third\nquarter of 2022. The increase in the current\nquarter provision expense primarily reflects\nhigher net charge-offs and an allowance build.\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off ratio was 51 basis\npoints, up 24 basis points compared to the\nthird quarter of 2022 due to higher charge-\noffs in the CRE, commercial and industrial,\nand indirect auto portfolios.\n\nCapital strengthened during the third quarter\nof 2023.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s CET1 ratio was 9.9% as of September\n30, 2023. The increase since June 30, 2023\nresulted from organic capital generation and\nRWA optimization.\n\n\u2022 Truist declared common dividends of $0.52\nper share during the third quarter of 2023.\nThe dividend payout ratio for the third\nquarter of 2023 was 65%. Truist did not\nrepurchase any shares in the third quarter of\n2023.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s average consolidated LCR was 110%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023,\ncompared to the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\n                                              \n  Analysis of Results of Operations           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Net Interest Income and NIM                 \n                                              \nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nthird quarter of 2023 was down $162 million,\nor 4.3%, compared to the third quarter of 2022\nprimarily due to higher funding costs and\nlower purchase accounting accretion, partially\noffset by higher market interest rates. Net\ninterest margin was 2.95%, down 17 basis\npoints.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets increased $6.4\nbillion, or 1.3%, primarily due to growth in\naverage total loans of $8.0 billion, or 2.6%,\nand growth in other earning assets of $9.4\nbillion, or 48%, primarily due to an increase\nin balances held at the Federal Reserve to\nsupport liquidity, partially offset by a\ndecrease in average securities of $9.9\nbillion, or 6.8%.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the total loan portfolio was\n6.25%, up 176 basis points, primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates,\npartially offset by lower purchase accounting\naccretion. The yield on the average securities\nportfolio was 2.26%, up 31 basis points\nprimarily due to the higher rate environment.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $19.1 billion, or\n4.5%, average short-term borrowings increased\n$7.5 billion, and average long-term debt\nincreased $12.0 billion.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was\n1.81%, up 150 basis points. The average cost\nof short-term borrowings was 5.47%, up 313\nbasis points. The average cost of long-term\ndebt was 4.51%, up 208 basis points. The\nincrease in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 was up\n$792 million, or 7.6%, compared to the same\nperiod in 2022 primarily due to higher market\ninterest rates and strong loan growth. These\nincreases were partially offset by lower\npurchase accounting accretion. Net interest\nmargin was 3.01% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, up eight basis points\ncompared to the prior period.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets increased $21.9\nbillion, or 4.6%, compared to the prior period\nprimarily due to growth in average total loans\nof $23.7 billion, or 7.9%, and growth in other\nearning assets of $9.9 billion, or 50%,\nprimarily due to an increase in balances held\nat the Federal Reserve to support liquidity\nbuild, partially offset by a $10.8 billion, or\n7.2%, decrease in average securities.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the total loan portfolio was\n6.04% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, up 200 basis points, compared to the\nprior period primarily reflecting higher\nmarket interest rates, partially offset by\nlower purchase accounting accretion. The yield\non the average securities portfolio was 2.19%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nup 37 basis points compared to the prior\nperiod primarily due to the higher rate\nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $16.6 billion, or\n4.0%, while average short-term borrowings\nincreased $13.0 billion, or 114%, compared to\nthe prior period and average long-term debt\nincreased $20.0 billion, or 61%.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was 1.48%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nup 133 basis points compared to the prior\nperiod. The average cost of short-term\nborrowings was 5.13% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, up 345 basis points\ncompared to the prior period. The average cost\non long-term debt was 4.41% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, up 253 basis\npoints compared to the prior period. The\nincreases in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe higher rate environment.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio and long-term debt were $528\nmillion and $49 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized\nfair value marks on the loan and lease\nportfolio and long-term debt were $741 million\nand $81 million, respectively.\n\nThe remaining unamortized purchase accounting\nfair value mark on loans and leases consists\nof $367 million for consumer loans and leases,\nand $161 million for commercial loans and\nleases. These amounts will be recognized over\nthe remaining contractual lives of the\nunderlying instruments or as paydowns occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n\n48 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Represents daily average balances.\nExcludes basis adjustments for fair value\nhedges.\n\n(2) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

Truist also\nreceives notification when the first lien\nholder, whether Truist or another financial\ninstitution, has initiated foreclosure\nproceedings against the borrower. When\nnotified that the first lien is in the process\nof foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to\ndetermine if any additional charge-offs or\nreserves are warranted. These valuations are\nupdated at least annually thereafter.\n\nTruist has limited ability to monitor the\ndelinquency status of the first lien, unless\nthe first lien is held or serviced by Truist.\nTruist estimates credit losses on second lien\nloans where the first lien is delinquent based\non historical experience; the increased risk\nof loss on these credits is reflected in the\nALLL. As of September 30, 2023, Truist held or\nserviced the first lien on 32% of its second\nlien positions.\n                                              \n  Other Assets                                \n                                              \nThe components of other assets are presented\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Table 14:                                   \n  Other                                       \n  Assets as                                   \n  of Period                                   \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Sep 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank-own\u2026                                   \n  life         $       7,694    $      7,618  \n  insurance                                   \n  Tax                                         \n  credit                                      \n  and other            7,449           6,825  \n  private                                     \n  equity                                      \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  Prepaid                                     \n  pension              5,964           4,539  \n  assets                                      \n  DTAs                 3,545           3,027  \n  Accounts             2,659           2,682  \n  receivab\u2026                                   \n  Accrued              2,335           2,265  \n  income                                      \n  Leased                                      \n  assets                                      \n  and                  1,914           2,082  \n  related                                     \n  assets                                      \n  FHLB                 1,284           1,279  \n  stock                                       \n  ROU                  1,112           1,193  \n  assets                                      \n  Prepaid              1,143           1,162  \n  expenses                                    \n  Equity                                      \n  securiti\u2026              330             898  \n  at fair                                     \n  value                                       \n  Derivati\u2026              749             684  \n  assets                                      \n  Other                  615             874  \n  Total                                       \n  other        $      36,793    $     35,128  \n  assets                                      \n                                              \n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Funding Activities                          \n                                              \nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents average deposits:\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       J\u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \nAverage deposits for the third quarter of 2023\nwere $401.0 billion, an increase of $1.2\nbillion, or 0.3%, compared to the prior\nquarter.\n\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n3.9% compared to the prior quarter and\nrepresented 29.6% of total deposits for the\nthird quarter of 2023 compared to 30.9% for\nthe second quarter of 2023 and 34.8% compared\nto the year ago quarter. Average time deposits\nincreased 14% due to increases in retail\nclient time deposits, primarily due to\nmigration from other deposit products, and\nbrokered time deposits. Average brokered\ndeposits were $33.0 billion, up $6.8 billion\ncompared to the prior quarter.\n\nTruist has a very granular and relationship-\nbased deposit franchise. Approximately 64% of\ndeposits are insured or collateralized. Truist\ndeposit accounts are typically based on long-\nterm relationships and include multiple\nproducts and services.\n\nThe estimated amount of deposits that are\nuninsured was $164.5 billion, $171.8 billion,\n$175.9 billion, and $189.6 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, March 31,\n2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively,\ncalculated using the same methodology as the\nCall Report for Truist Bank. The decrease in\nuninsured deposits from December 31, 2022 to\nJune 30, 2023 was largely due to commercial\nclients that chose to diversify into money\nmarket mutual funds or across multiple banks\nlate in the first quarter. These outflows were\nprimarily higher-cost, non-operational\ndeposits. The decrease in uninsured deposits\nduring the third quarter of 2023 was primarily\ndue to the maturity of large denominated\nnegotiable certificates of deposit.\n\nBorrowings\n\nAt September 30, 2023, short-term borrowings\ntotaled $23.5 billion, an increase of $63\nmillion compared to December 31, 2022. Average\nshort-term borrowings were $24.3 billion, or\n5.1% of total funding, for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, as compared to $11.4\nbillion, or 2.4%, for the same period in the\nprior year.\n\nLong-term debt provides funding and, to a\nlesser extent, regulatory capital, and\nprimarily consists of senior and subordinated\nnotes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-\nterm debt totaled $41.2 billion at September\n30, 2023, a decrease of $2.0 billion compared\nto December 31, 2022.

Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses two methods to\nmeasure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income based on instantaneous and\ngradual changes in interest rates and (ii)\nanalysis of economic value of equity based on\nchanges in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist applies an\naverage deposit beta of approximately 50% to\nits interest-bearing accounts when determining\nits interest rate sensitivity, which is\nconsistent with Truist\u2019s long-term\nexpectations. Truist also regularly conducts\nsensitivity analyses on other key variables,\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits, to\ndetermine the impact these variables could\nhave on the Company\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition. The predictive value of the\nsimulation model depends upon the accuracy of\nthe assumptions, but management believes that\nit provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \nNet interest income is liability sensitive as\nelevated rates and quantitative tightening\nhave led to a reduction in deposits, rotation\ninto interest bearing deposits, and higher\ndeposit betas.\n\nInterest rate scenarios in table 17 assume no\nchange in deposit mix. Further rotation from\nnon-interest bearing into interest bearing\ndeposits would increase the liability\nsensitivity of Truist\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of additional demand\ndeposits and an associated increase in managed\nrate deposits versus current projections under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. For purposes\nof this analysis, Truist modeled the\nincremental beta of managed rate deposits for\nthe replacement of the demand deposits at 100%\n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\n.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  18:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n                        Resu\u2026                 \n  Grad\u2026      Base       Assu\u2026                 \n  Chan\u2026    Scena\u2026           a                 \n  in           at       Decr\u2026                 \n  Rates    Septe\u2026          in                 \n  (bps)       30,       Noni\u2026                 \n           2023(\u2026       Dema\u2026                 \n                        Depo\u2026                 \n              $20         $40                 \n           Billi\u2026       Bill\u2026                 \n  Up        -1.03  %    -1.81  %    -2.58  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50     -0.67       -1.23       -1.80     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at September 30, 2023 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nmortgage banking operations, long-term debt,\nand other funding sources. Truist has utilized\nderivatives to facilitate transactions on\nbehalf of its clients and as part of\nassociated hedging activities. As of September\n30, 2023, Truist had derivative financial\ninstruments outstanding with notional amounts\ntotaling $379.8 billion. See \u201cNote 16.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d for\nadditional disclosures. In the third quarter\nof 2023, there was a $125 billion decrease in\nnotional amounts on derivatives with central\nclearing parties as a result of conversion\nfrom LIBOR to SOFR. The decline in notional is\ndue to the maturity of short-term LIBOR swaps\nentered into in the second quarter of 2023 to\nmaintain LIBOR cashflows until the phase out\nof the LIBOR reference rate on June 30th,\n2023. All remaining short-term impacts of the\nconversion are expected to mature in the\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nThe remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR\nceased publication on June 30, 2023. Truist\nprovided timely notices and information to\nimpacted clients about the transition to new\ninterest rates post cessation. Most contracts\nwere transitioned to new rates in July and\nAugust 2023. A small number of contracts\nutilize longer tenor LIBOR rates and will\ntransition by late 2023 (3-month LIBOR) or\nearly 2024 (6-month and 12-month LIBOR) based\non contractual agreements. Truist has\nmaterially completed LIBOR transition efforts,\nprimarily utilizing SOFR replacement rates,\nand closed formal project efforts as of\nSeptember 2023.\n\nFallback language used to remediate loan\nagreements was generally consistent with ARRC\nrecommendations and included use of \u201chardwired\nfallback\u201d language, which transitioned loans\nto a SOFR based rate after June 30, 2023. For\ncontracts remaining without fallback language,\nTruist leveraged the LIBOR Act and\ncorresponding safe harbor provision to\ntransition these loans to SOFR. Truist\u2019s\nadjustable-rate mortgage products had\nconsistent and adequate fallback language to\ntransition to SOFR, based on lender discretion\nand as supported by the LIBOR Act; therefore,\nthese contracts did not require remediation.\nFor many consumer lending portfolios, LIBOR\ntransitioned to the SOFR rate specified in the\nLIBOR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder\nby the FRB and benefit from the safe harbor\nprovisions of the LIBOR Act.\n\nDerivatives that reference LIBOR transitioned\nto a SOFR-based replacement rate as set forth\nin the ISDA protocol addressing LIBOR\nfallbacks between the Company and its\ncounterparties which have adhered to the\nprotocol, through bilateral amendments between\nthe Company and each of its counterparties, or\nas established under the LIBOR Act and rules\npromulgated thereunder by the FRB. Fallback\nlanguage used to remediate LIBOR based\nderivatives was generally consistent with ISDA\npublications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s preferred securities and the\nCompany\u2019s and Truist Bank\u2019s floating rate\nnotes that reference LIBOR transitioned to a\nSOFR based rate utilizing application of the\nLIBOR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder\nby the FRB. Truist announced that these\nsecurities would move to a 3-month adjusted\nTerm SOFR in accordance with the LIBOR Act.\nSee \u201cNote 12.

Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$91 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of September 30, 2023.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three\nmonths and nine months ended September 30,\n2023 and 2022. Average one and ten-day VaR\nmeasures for the three months ended September\n30, 2023 increased from the same period of\nlast year, primarily driven by higher market\nmaking inventory.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 67\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended September 30,\n2023. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRO policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $83.8 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 110% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At September 30,\n2023, Truist was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 21:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Sep 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      54,633    $     49,250  \n  FHLB                23,615          20,770  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           73,010          85,401  \n  (after                                      \n  haircuts)                                   \n  Available                                   \n  secured            151,258         155,421  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             24,177          15,556  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     175,435    $    170,977  \n                                              \nAt September 30, 2023, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 3.5 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless. Truist additionally has the ability to\nincrease sources of funding by pledging\navailable investment securities to receive the\npar value of the collateral under the FRB Bank\nTerm Funding Program.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on and, from time-to-time, potential\nrepurchases or redemptions of a portion of an\noutstanding tranche of the long-term debt of\nthe Parent Company or the Bank (as may be\npermitted by the terms of each respective\nseries). See \u201cNote 22. Parent Company\nFinancial Information\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional information\nregarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt\ntransactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Parent Company had 42\nmonths and 37 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n25 months and 22 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings: Recent changes in\nthe Company\u2019s credit ratings and outlooks\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 On March 31, 2023, S&P Global Ratings\naffirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\nand revised the outlook on those ratings to\n\u201cstable\u201d from \u201cpositive,\u201d citing heightened\nmarket volatility in the wake of recent bank\nfailures and, with inflation still elevated,\nhigher uncertainty, and greater downside risk\nin the economic outlook. The change in outlook\nwas part of a broader action by S&P Global\nRatings whereby the \u201cpositive\u201d outlook on\nthree other large U.S. banks was revised to\n\u201cstable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 On August 7, 2023, Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nplaced the long-term ratings and certain\nshort-term ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\n\u201cunder review for downgrade,\u201d citing Truist\u2019s\ncomparatively low, though improving, level of\ncapitalization, along with weaknesses in\nasset-liability management. The review also\nreflects Moody\u2019s Investor Service view that\nthe stability of U.S. banks\u2019 deposit funding\nhas declined, as reflected in the agency\u2019s\ndecision to lower the U.S. macro profile.\n\n\u2022 On August 11, 2023, DBRS, Inc. affirmed the\nratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nmaintained a \u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook, citing\nTruist\u2019s highly scaled and diversified\nregional banking franchise, conservative risk\nprofile, and sound liquidity management and\ncapital levels. In affirming the ratings,\nDBRS, Inc. also noted the ratings take into\naccount the more challenging operating\nenvironment and the expectation that funding\ncosts and asset quality metrics could worsen\nfrom current levels, providing some pressure\nto earnings, and that credit deterioration\nassociated with normalization of the credit\ncycle would be manageable.\n\n\u2022 On August 21, 2023, S&P Global Ratings\naffirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank\nand maintained a \u201cstable\u201d ratings outlook,\nciting Truist\u2019s strong market position and\ndiversified business model as a substantial\noffset to deposit and margin pressures. S&P\nGlobal Ratings viewed Truist\u2019s capital ratios\nunfavorably after considering unrealized\nlosses on securities but also wrote that\nTruist has the earnings capacity to build its\ncapital ratios and support franchise growth\nover time.\n\n\u2022 After the end of the third quarter, on\nOctober 16, 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed the\nratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised\nthe ratings outlook to \u201cnegative\u201d from\n\u201cstable.\u201d In affirming Truist\u2019s ratings, Fitch\nRatings cited the company\u2019s diverse revenue\nmodel, solid asset quality, and expected\ncapital build over the rating horizon;\nhowever, \u201cnegative\u201d ratings outlook reflects\nthe view of Fitch Ratings that Truist\ncurrently has less \u201cheadroom\u201d to face\nincreasing earnings pressures than similarly-\nrated peers.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis.

Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital limits, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented internal stress\ncapital ratio minimums to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above internal minimums.

Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations, and related disclosures. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nsecurities, MSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and\nderivative assets and liabilities; goodwill\nand other intangible assets; income taxes; and\npension and postretirement benefit\nobligations. Understanding Truist\u2019s accounting\npolicies is fundamental to understanding the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations. The\ncritical accounting policies are discussed in\nMD&A in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSignificant accounting policies and changes in\naccounting principles and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDisclosures regarding the effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are included in\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in this\nreport. There have been no changes to the\nsignificant accounting policies during 2023.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nThe Company performs goodwill impairment\nanalysis annually as of October 1 or more\noften if events or circumstances indicate that\nit is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is below its carrying\nvalue. During the third quarter of 2023, the\nCompany observed continuing declines in its\nfinancial forecasts for its CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units. The Company considered such\ndeclines in the context of industry related\nfactors, including a decline in bank share\nprices, concluding that a triggering event had\noccurred for its CB&W and C&CB reporting\nunits, and therefore Truist performed a\nquantitative test for these reporting units as\nof August 1, 2023. Truist also elected to\nperform a quantitative test for the IH\nreporting unit concurrent with the other\nunits. The quantitative impairment test\nestimates the fair value of the reporting\nunits using the income approach (weighted 50%)\nand two market based approaches: the guideline\npublic company (weighted 30%) and guideline\ntransaction (weighted 20%) methods. The income\napproach utilizes a discounted cash flow\nanalysis. The guideline public company\napproach utilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples, and\nconsiders a market control premium associated\nwith cost synergies and other cash flow\nbenefits that arise from obtaining control\nover a reporting unit, and guideline\ntransactions, when applicable. The guideline\ntransaction method uses market observable\ntransaction multiples for non-regulatory\nassisted transactions occurring within the\npast 12 months, which inherently incorporate a\npremium associated with the benefits of\nobtaining control.\n\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates, applicable\nvaluation multiples based on the comparable\npublic company information, and guideline\ntransaction information. Truist also assesses\nthe reasonableness of the aggregate estimated\nfair value of the reporting units by\ncomparison to its market capitalization over a\nreasonable period of time, including\nconsideration of expected acquirer expense\nsynergies, historic bank control premiums, and\nthe current market.\n\nMulti-year financial forecasts are developed\nfor each reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions such as net interest\nmargin, expected credit losses, noninterest\nincome, noninterest expense, and required\ncapital. The projection of net interest margin\nand noninterest expense are the most\nsignificant inputs to the financial\nprojections of the CB&W and C&CB reporting\nunits. The long-term growth rate used in\ndetermining the terminal value of each\nreporting unit was 3% as of August 1, 2023,\nbased on management\u2019s assessment of the\nminimum expected terminal growth rate of each\nreporting unit. Discount rates are estimated\nbased on the Capital Asset Pricing Model,\nwhich considers the risk-free interest rate,\nmarket risk premium, beta, and unsystematic\nrisk adjustments specific to a particular\nreporting unit. The discount rates are also\ncalibrated based on risks related to the\nprojected cash flows of each reporting unit.\nThe discount rates utilized for the CB&W,\nC&CB, and IH reporting units as of August 1,\n2023 were 12.5%, 11.5%, and 10.0%,\nrespectively.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nBased on the Company\u2019s interim impairment test\nof goodwill, it was determined for the CB&W,\nC&CB, and IH reporting units that the\nrespective reporting units\u2019 fair value was in\nexcess of its respective carrying value as of\nAugust 1, 2023; however, for the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units the fair value of the\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\nless than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of\nthese reporting units may be at risk of\nimpairment. Circumstances that could\nnegatively impact the fair value for the CB&W\nand C&CB reporting units in the future include\nsustained decrease in Truist stock price,\ncontinued decline in industry peer multiples,\nan increase in the applicable discount rate\nand further deterioration in the reporting\nunits\u2019 forecasts.\n\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value. The\nCompany performs sensitivity analyses around\nthese assumptions in order to assess the\nreasonableness of the assumptions, and the\nresulting estimated fair values. The analysis\nof the CB&W and C&CB reporting unit at August\n1, 2023, indicated that if the discount rates\nwere increased 120 basis points and 100 basis\npoints, respectively, the reporting unit\u2019s\nfair value would be less than its carrying\nvalue, resulting in goodwill impairment.\nUltimately, future potential changes in these\nassumptions may impact the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit and cause the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit to be below its\ncarrying value. Additionally, a reporting\nunit\u2019s carrying value could change based on\nmarket conditions, change in the underlying\nmakeup of the reporting unit, or the risk\nprofile of those reporting units, which could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from August 1, 2023 through\nSeptember 30, 2023, including macroeconomic\nand market factors, industry and banking\nsector events, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nAugust 1, 2023 quantitative impairment test,\nand the sensitivity of the August 1, 2023\nquantitative test results to changes in\nassumptions through September 30, 2023. Based\non these considerations, management concluded\nthat it was not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of one or more of its reporting\nunits is below its respective carrying amount\nas of September 30, 2023.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 4.
