                              \n  Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is intensely\ncompetitive and constantly evolving.\nManagement believes that Truist\u2019s purpose,\nmission, and values, including a caring\nclient-first approach, are a competitive\nadvantage that strengthens the Company\u2019s\nability to provide financial products and\nservices to businesses and individuals in its\nmarkets. The Company has recently made\nsignificant investments to develop its digital\nplatform, including enhancements to its mobile\nand online applications to meet its clients\u2019\ndigital expectations. Legislative, regulatory,\neconomic, and technological changes, as well\nas continued consolidation within the\nindustry, have resulted in increased\ncompetition from new and existing market\nparticipants, which is expected to continue in\nthe future. Truist competes actively with\nnational, regional, and local financial\nservices providers, including banks, thrifts,\ncredit unions, investment advisers, asset\nmanagers, securities brokers and dealers,\nprivate-equity funds, hedge funds, mortgage-\nbanking companies, finance companies, and\nfinancial technology companies. At the same\ntime, non-banking entities, including\nfinancial technology companies, have increased\ncompetition by providing financial products\nand services directly to customers and\nindirectly through partnerships.\n\nMany of our competitors have substantial\npositions nationally or in the markets in\nwhich we operate. Some also have greater\nscale, financial and operational resources,\ninvestment capacity, product and service\nofferings, and brand recognition. Our\ncompetitors may be subject to different and,\nin some cases, less stringent legislative,\nregulatory, and supervisory regimes than\nTruist. Certain competitors differ from us in\ntheir strategic and tactical priorities and,\nfor example, may be willing to suffer\nmeaningful financial losses in the pursuit of\ndisruptive innovation and client growth or to\naccept more aggressive business, compliance,\nand other risks in the pursuit of higher\nreturns and market valuations. Competition\naffects every aspect of our business,\nincluding product and service offerings,\nrates, pricing and fees, credit limits, and\nclient service. Successfully competing in our\nmarkets also depends on our ability to\ninnovate, to invest in technology and\ninfrastructure, to execute transactions\nreliably and efficiently, to maintain and\nenhance our reputation, and to attract,\nretain, and motivate talented teammates, all\nwhile effectively managing risks and expenses.\nWe expect that competition will only intensify\nin the future.\n                                              \n  Purpose, Mission, and Values                \n                                              \nOur purpose is to inspire and build better\nlives and communities.\n\nOur mission is to:\n\n\u2022 Provide clients with distinctive, secure,\nand successful experiences through touch and\ntechnology;\n\n\u2022 Create an inclusive and energizing\nenvironment that empowers teammates to learn,\ngrow, and have meaningful careers; and\n\n\u2022 Optimize long-term value for stakeholders\nthrough safe, sound, and ethical practices.\n\nOur values are:\n\n\u2022 Trustworthy \u2013 we serve with integrity\n\n\u2022 Caring \u2013 everyone and every moment matters\n\n\u2022 One Team \u2013 together we can accomplish\nanything\n\n\u2022 Success \u2013 when our clients win, we all win\n\n\u2022 Happiness \u2013 positive energy changes lives\n                                              \n  Strategy                                    \n                                              \nOur strategic direction is to build the top\nsuper regional bank that grows with our\nclients with care. Our 2025 strategic\nobjectives are to:\n\n\u2022 Leverage our capital position by growing and\ncapturing additional share within our high\ngrowth markets and existing client base in key\nfocus areas in WB and CSBB and in areas,\nmarkets, and client solutions where we have\ninvested significantly and have momentum.\n\n\u2022 In WB, deepen and grow existing client\nrelationships in areas like Payments and\nWealth, enhance the client digital experience,\ncontinue our momentum in Investment Banking\nand Trading, and capture more share of the\ncommercial middle market.\n\n\u2022 In CSBB, grow core deposits, deepen existing\nrelationships with Premier clients, enhance\nthe client digital experience, and drive\nadditional fee and loan growth through our\ndifferentiated consumer lending solutions.\n\n\u2022 Continue to invest in important areas like\nnew and existing talent, technology, risk, and\ncybersecurity, while maintaining our expense\ndiscipline with a goal of driving positive\noperating leverage.\n\n\u2022 Maintain our credit and risk discipline.\n\n\u2022 Return capital to shareholders through our\ncommon stock dividend and share repurchase\nauthorization.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 5\nAlthough mergers and acquisitions are not a\ntop capital deployment priority for Truist,\nthe Company will assess opportunities when\nstrategic and business objectives,\nprofitability, cultural fit, market and\nregulatory conditions, capital and liquidity,\nand risk-management considerations favorably\nalign.\n\nChallenges and unforeseen events could have an\nadverse impact on Truist\u2019s financial\ncondition, results of operations, and\nstrategy. See the sections titled \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for\nexamples of such challenges and events.\n                                              \n  Regulatory and Supervisory Considerations   \n                                              \nWe are subject to significant regulatory\nframeworks that affect the products and\nservices that we may offer and the manner in\nwhich we may offer them, the risks that we may\ntake, the ways in which we may operate, and\nthe corporate and financial actions that we\nmay take.\n\nVarious governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations oversee our business\nactivities and therefore supervise and\nperiodically examine us. These agencies and\norganizations generally have broad authority\nand discretion in restricting and otherwise\naffecting our businesses and operations and\nmay take formal or informal supervisory,\nenforcement, and other actions against us\nwhen, in the applicable agency\u2019s or\norganization\u2019s judgment, our businesses or\noperations fail to comply with applicable law,\ncomport with safe and sound practices, or meet\nsupervisory expectations.\n\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework\napplicable to banking organizations is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and other customers, the DIF, the\nbroader economy, and the stability of the U.S.\nfinancial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and non-deposit\ncreditors. In addition to banking statutes,\nregulations, and other laws, Truist is subject\nto various other laws that directly or\nindirectly affect its business and operations,\nincluding its ability to make distributions to\nshareholders. Governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations also issue policy\nstatements, interpretive letters, guidance,\nand other documents and communications that\nsimilarly impact Truist. The scope,\ncomplexity, intensity, and interpretation of\nthese laws, documents, communications, and\nactions can vary based on such factors as the\nstate of the economy, the prevailing political\nenvironment, and the performance of businesses\nand operations by us and other financial\ninstitutions.\n\nThe scope of the laws, documents,\ncommunications, and actions, including the\nintensity of the supervision to which the\nbanking industry is subject, have increased in\nrecent years. Regulatory enforcement and fines\nhave also increased across the banking and\nfinancial services sector. Truist expects to\nremain subject to extensive regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nThis section summarizes some relevant\nprovisions of the principal statutes,\nregulations, and other laws that apply to us.\nThese descriptions, however, are qualified in\ntheir entirety by the full text and judicial\nor administrative interpretations of those\nlaws. This summary also does not cover all\npossible or proposed changes in laws\napplicable to us.\n                                              \n  General                                     \n                                              \nAs a BHC, Truist is subject to the BHCA and to\nregulation, supervision, and examination by\nthe FRB. Truist Bank, a North Carolina state-\nchartered commercial bank that is not a member\nof the Federal Reserve System, is subject to\nregulation, supervision, and examination by\nthe NCCOB and the FDIC. Truist Bank and its\naffiliates are also subject to examination by\nthe CFPB for compliance with most federal\nconsumer financial protection laws.\n\nTruist and certain of its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, including those that engage in\nderivatives transactions, securities\nunderwriting, market making, brokerage, and\ninvestment advisory activities, are subject to\nother federal and state laws and regulations,\nas well as supervision and examination by\nother federal and state regulatory agencies\nand other regulatory authorities, including\nthe SEC, CFTC, FINRA, and NFA. Truist Bank is\nsubject to additional state and federal laws,\nas well as various regulations, which govern\nits activities, the investments it may make,\nand the aggregate amount of loans that may be\ngranted to one borrower.\n\nExaminations by regulators consider not only\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations,\nand supervisory policies of the agency, but\nalso capital levels, asset quality, risk\nmanagement effectiveness, the ability and\nperformance of management and the Board, the\neffectiveness of internal controls, earnings,\nliquidity, and various other factors.\nFollowing examinations by banking supervisors,\nTruist and Truist Bank may receive supervisory\nfindings and ultimately are assigned\nsupervisory ratings. Examination reports,\nsupervisory ratings, and other actions under\nthis supervisory framework, which are\nconsidered confidential supervisory\ninformation, can impact the conduct, growth,\nand profitability of Truist\u2019s operations,\npossibly to a significant degree. Refer to\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information\non legal, regulatory, and compliance risks.\n\n6 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nUnder the FRB\u2019s Large Financial Institution\nRating System, component ratings are assigned\nfor capital planning and positions, liquidity\nrisk management, and governance and controls.\nTo be considered \u201cwell managed\u201d under this\nrating system, a firm must be rated \u201cbroadly\nmeets expectations\u201d or \u201cconditionally meets\nexpectations\u201d for each of its three component\nratings.\n\nDepending on the results of examinations of\nTruist, federal or state bank regulators can\nimpose significant limitations on our\nactivities and growth. These regulatory\nagencies generally have broad enforcement\nauthority and discretion to impose\nrestrictions and limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity. Examples of\nrestrictions and limitations include the\nimposition of substantial monetary penalties\nand nonmonetary requirements where the\nrelevant agency determines that the operations\nof the regulated entity or any of its\nsubsidiaries fail to comply with applicable\nlaws or regulations, are conducted in an\nunsafe or unsound manner, engage in an unfair,\ndeceptive, abusive act or practice, or do not\nmeet supervisory expectations. The intensity\nof supervision has increased in recent years.\n                                              \n  FHC Regulation                              \n                                              \nTruist has elected to be treated as a FHC,\nwhich allows it to engage in a broader range\nof activities than would otherwise be\npermissible for a BHC, including activities\nthat are financial in nature or incidental\nthereto, such as securities underwriting or\nmerchant banking. Although FHCs may engage in\ncertain acquisitions of nonbank companies\nwithout prior approval of the FRB, any\nacquisition of a nonbank company or voting\nshares of a nonbank company with total\nconsolidated assets of $10 billion or more\nwould require prior approval of the FRB. To\nmaintain its standing as a FHC, Truist and its\naffiliated IDI must be well-capitalized and\nwell managed and Truist Bank must have at\nleast a satisfactory CRA rating. If the FRB\ndetermines that a FHC is not well-capitalized\nor well managed, the FRB may impose corrective\ncapital and managerial requirements on the\nFHC. In such a situation, the FRB may also\nplace limitations on the ability of an FHC to\nconduct certain business activities that FHCs\nare generally permitted to conduct, as well as\nthe FHC\u2019s ability to make certain\nacquisitions. If the failure to meet these\nstandards persists, a FHC may be required to\ndivest its IDI subsidiaries or cease all\nactivities other than those activities that\nmay be conducted by BHCs that are not FHCs.\nFurthermore, if an IDI subsidiary of a FHC has\nnot maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the\nFHC would not be able to commence any new\nfinancial activities or acquire a company that\nengages in such activities, although the FHC\nwould still be allowed to engage in activities\nclosely related to banking and make\ninvestments in the ordinary course of\nconducting banking activities. Federal\nregulations require a FHC to act as a source\nof financial and managerial strength for its\nsubsidiary banks. In times of severe financial\nstress, the obligation to serve as a source of\nstrength could cause Truist to commit\nsignificant resources to supporting Truist\nBank that otherwise would be available to\nTruist\u2019s creditors and shareholders.\n                                              \n  Resolution Planning                         \n                                              \nAs a Category III banking organization, Truist\nis required to submit to the FRB and FDIC a\nresolution plan every three years with\nsubmissions alternating between a full\nresolution plan and a targeted resolution plan\n(a \u201c165(d) Resolution Plan\u201d). Upon review of\nthe plan, the agencies may jointly determine\nthat a resolution plan is not credible or\nwould not facilitate an orderly resolution\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon making\nthis determination, the agencies would provide\na joint notice identifying one or more\ndeficiencies that could undermine the\nfeasibility of the resolution plan. If Truist\nreceives such a notice and fails to submit a\ntimely revised resolution plan or a revised\nresolution plan that fails to adequately\naddress the deficiencies, the agencies could\nsubject Truist to more stringent capital,\nleverage, or liquidity requirements, or\nrestrictions on growth, activities, or\noperations. Truist submitted its inaugural\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC in\nSeptember 2021. On September 30, 2022, the FRB\nand FDIC announced that they did not identify\nany shortcomings or deficiencies in Truist\u2019s\nresolution plan. Truist\u2019s next full 165(d)\nResolution Plan is due October 1, 2025.\n\nIn addition, Truist Bank, as an IDI, is\nrequired by FDIC regulation to file a separate\nbank level resolution plan every three years\n(an \u201cIDI Resolution Plan\u201d). Truist Bank\nsubmitted its inaugural IDI Resolution Plan to\nthe FDIC in November 2022. In 2024, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule that significantly\nmodified the required frequency and\ninformational content of IDI Resolution Plans.\nAs a result of the rule, Truist Bank must\nsubmit a full IDI Resolution Plan to the FDIC\nevery three years and an interim supplement in\nthe years in which a full IDI Resolution Plan\nis not due. Further, the final rule introduces\na new credibility standard for evaluating the\nadequacy of IDI Resolution Plan submissions,\nincluding increased engagement and\ncapabilities testing. The application of this\nnew credibility standard may require the\nexercise of a meaningful degree of judgment by\nthe FDIC. A failure by Truist Bank to satisfy\nthe credibility standard, or any other\nprovision of the rule, may cause the FDIC to\nrequire Truist Bank to reconsider portions of\nits IDI Resolution Plan or result in an\nenforcement action by the FDIC. Truist Bank\u2019s\nfirst interim supplement is due July 1, 2025,\nand its full IDI Resolution Plan submission is\ndue July 1, 2026.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory\nTailoring Rules\n\nU.S. BHCs, including Truist, are subject to a\nrange of prudential standards based on their\nsize and complexity. Truist is subject to more\nstringent liquidity and capital requirements,\nleverage limits, stress testing, single-\ncounterparty credit limits, resolution\nplanning, and enhanced risk management\nstandards than those applicable to smaller\ninstitutions, while certain larger banking\norganizations are subject to even more\nenhanced prudential standards than Truist.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 7\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Truist is subject\nto the standards applicable to Category III\nbanking organizations, which generally include\nBHCs with greater than $250 billion, but less\nthan $700 billion, in total consolidated\nassets and less than $75 billion in certain\nrisk-related exposures.\n                                              \n  Capital Requirements                        \n                                              \nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to certain\nrisk-based and leverage capital ratio\nrequirements. These are established by the\nFRB, for Truist, and by the FDIC, for Truist\nBank. These requirements are based on the\ncapital framework developed by the BCBS for\nstrengthening the regulation, supervision, and\nrisk management of banks under Basel III\nrules, as well as certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. These quantitative\ncalculations prescribe minimum capital levels,\nand the FRB and FDIC may determine that a\nbanking organization, based on its size,\ncomplexity, or risk profile, must maintain a\nhigher level of capital to operate in a safe\nand sound manner. Failure to be well-\ncapitalized or to meet minimum capital\nrequirements could result in certain mandatory\nand discretionary actions by regulators that,\nif undertaken, could have an adverse material\neffect on our operations or financial\ncondition. These actions could include\nrequiring Truist to commit capital to Truist\nBank in abnormal operating conditions which\nwould otherwise be available to Truist\u2019s\ncreditors and shareholders. Failure to be\nwell-capitalized or to meet minimum capital\nrequirements could also result in restrictions\non Truist\u2019s or Truist Bank\u2019s ability to pay\ndividends or otherwise distribute capital or\nto receive regulatory approval for\nacquisitions.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, Truist\u2019s\nand Truist Bank\u2019s assets, exposures, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items are subject to\nrisk weights under the standardized approach\nused to determine the institutions\u2019 risk-\nweighted assets. These risk-weighted assets\nare used to calculate the following minimum\ncapital ratios for Truist and Truist Bank:\n\n\u2022 CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\nCET1 capital primarily includes common\nshareholders\u2019 equity subject to certain\nregulatory adjustments and deductions,\nincluding with respect to goodwill, intangible\nassets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n\n\u2022 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised\nof CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock,\nand certain qualifying capital instruments.\n\n\u2022 Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of total capital, including CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital,\nto risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital\nprimarily includes qualifying subordinated\ndebt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also\nincludes, among other things, certain trust\npreferred securities.\n\nUnder the FRB\u2019s capital framework for BHCs,\nTruist is subject to capital requirements,\nincluding the SCB, that are determined from\nthe supervisory stress test results. The SCB\nis equal to the greater of (i) the difference\nbetween Truist\u2019s starting and minimum\nprojected CET1 capital ratios under the\nseverely adverse scenario in the supervisory\nstress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount\nof its planned common stock dividends for each\nof the fourth through seventh quarters of the\nplanning horizon as a percentage of risk-\nweighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. The FRB\nassigned Truist an SCB of 2.8%, which is\neffective from October 1, 2024 to September\n30, 2025, at which point a revised SCB will be\ncalculated and provided to Truist. Truist is\nrequired to describe its planned capital\nactions in its CCAR capital plan, but is no\nlonger required to seek prior approval if it\nmakes capital distributions in excess of those\nincluded in its CCAR capital plan. Instead,\nTruist is subject to automatic distribution\nlimitations if its capital ratios fall below\nits buffer requirements, which include the\nSCB.\n\nFor certain large banking organizations, the\nSCB could be supplemented by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently\nset at zero. An FRB policy statement\nestablishes the framework and factors the FRB\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the countercyclical capital buffer. Covered\nbanking organizations would generally have 12\nmonths after the announcement of any increase\nin the countercyclical capital buffer to meet\nthe increased buffer requirement, unless the\nFRB determines to establish an earlier\neffective date. If the full countercyclical\nbuffer amount is implemented, Truist would be\nrequired to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of\nat least 9.8%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at\nleast 11.3%, and a Total capital ratio of at\nleast 13.3% to avoid limitations on capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary\nincentive compensation payments. In addition,\nTruist Bank would be required to maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of at least 11.0%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 13.0%.\n\nCertain large banking organizations with\ntrading assets and liabilities above certain\nthresholds, including Truist, are subject to\nthe Market Risk Rule and must adjust their\nrisk-based capital ratios to reflect the\nmarket risk of their trading activities. Refer\nto the \u201cMarket Risk\u201d section of the MD&A for\nadditional disclosures related to market risk\nmanagement.\n\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to a Tier 1\nleverage ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to quarterly average assets, net of\ngoodwill, certain other intangible assets, and\ncertain other deductions. Category III banking\norganizations are also subject to a minimum\n3.0% supplementary leverage ratio. The\nsupplementary leverage ratio is calculated by\ndividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage\nexposure, which takes into account on-balance\nsheet assets as well as certain off-balance\nsheet items, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure of derivative\ncontracts.\n\n8 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe FRB has not yet revised the well-\ncapitalized standard for BHCs to reflect\ncapital requirements imposed under the Basel\nIII Rules. For purposes of certain FRB rules,\nincluding determining whether a BHC meets the\nrequirements to be a FHC, BHCs, such as\nTruist, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based\nCapital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total\nRisk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater\nto meet the well-capitalized minimum. The FRB\nmay require BHCs, including Truist, to\nmaintain capital ratios in excess of mandated\nminimum levels, depending upon general\neconomic conditions and a BHC\u2019s particular\ncondition, risk profile, and growth plans.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators\nissued a proposal to revise the risk-based\ncapital standards applicable to Truist and\nTruist Bank. This proposal would introduce new\napproaches for credit risk, operational risk,\nmarket risk, and credit valuation adjustment\nrisk that generally align with the approaches\nfor these risks under the global Basel Accord\nadopted by the Basel Committee. The proposal\nwould introduce a new measure of risk-weighted\nassets, which would reflect the proposed new\nstandardized approaches for credit risk,\noperational risk, and credit valuation\nadjustment risk, as well as a proposed new\nmeasure for market risk that would be based on\nboth internal models and standardized\nsupervisory models of market risk. In\naddition, the proposal requires Category III\nand IV financial institutions to include\ncertain components of AOCI in the calculation\nof regulatory capital, as well as change the\ncalculation of certain deductions consistent\nwith standards in place for Category I and II\nfinancial institutions. The FRB has indicated\nthe intent to re-propose the revised risk-\nbased capital standards. The potential impacts\non Truist and Truist Bank of a final rule\nremains uncertain.\n\nRefer to the \u201cCapital\u201d section in MD&A for\ndisclosures containing the minimum regulatory\ncapital ratios and well-capitalized minimum\nratios applicable to Category III banking\norganizations.\n                                              \n  Capital Planning and Stress Testing         \n  Requirements                                \n                                              \nIn addition to the regulatory capital\nrequirements, under the FRB\u2019s CCAR process and\nrelated capital plan rule, Truist must submit\nan annual capital plan to the FRB that\nreflects its projected financial performance\nunder hypothetical macro-economic scenarios,\nincluding stress scenarios designed by Truist\nand a supervisory severely adverse scenario\nprovided by the FRB.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank\nAct stress testing framework also require BHCs\nsubject to Category III standards, such as\nTruist, to conduct company-run stress tests\nand submit to supervisory stress tests\nconducted by the FRB. The company-run stress\ntests employ stress scenarios provided by the\nFRB and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital\nactions, which are intended to normalize\ncapital distribution assumptions across large\nU.S. BHCs. In addition, Truist is required to\nconduct annual stress tests using internally-\ndeveloped scenarios intended to stress the\nunique risk profile of the institution. The\nFRB also conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act\nsupervisory stress tests employing internal\nsupervisory models on the supervisory stress\nscenarios. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to supervisory\nstress testing on an annual basis and company-\nrun stress testing on a biennial basis.\n\nTruist is required to submit its next capital\nplan and the results of its own stress tests\nto the FRB by April 5, 2025. The FRB is\nrequired to announce the results of its\nsupervisory stress tests by June 30, 2025.\n\nIn addition to the CCAR stress testing for\nTruist, Truist Bank conducts company-run\nstress tests on an annual basis, though those\ntests are only required biennially. Truist and\nTruist Bank also conduct periodic company-run\nstress tests that are not related to\nsupervisory stress testing requirements.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Requirements                      \n                                              \nCertain BHCs and their bank subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, are subject\nto a minimum LCR and NSFR. The LCR rule\nrequires that banking organizations maintain\nan amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient\nwithin the parameters of the rule to meet\nestimated total net cash outflows over a\nprospective 30 calendar-day period of stress.\nThe NSFR rule defines a minimum amount of\nstable, long-term funding that banking\norganizations must maintain in relation to\ntheir asset composition and off-balance sheet\nactivities. The NSFR, calculated as the ratio\nof available stable funding to required stable\nfunding, must exceed 1.0x. Available stable\nfunding represents a weighted measure of a\ncompany\u2019s funding sources over a one-year time\nhorizon, calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to the company\u2019s equity and\nliabilities based on their expected stability.\nRequired Stable Funding is calculated by\napplying standardized weightings to assets,\nderivatives exposures, and certain other items\nbased on their liquidity characteristics. As a\nCategory III banking organization, Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to LCR and NSFR\nrequirements equal to 85% of the full\nrequirement.\n\nTruist also is subject to FRB rules that\nrequire certain large BHCs to conduct internal\nliquidity stress tests over a range of time\nhorizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid\nassets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity\nstress test, and maintain a contingency\nfunding plan that meets certain requirements.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\nLong-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company\nRequirements\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed\na rule that would require banking\norganizations with $100 billion or more in\ntotal assets to comply with long-term debt\nrequirements and clean holding company\nrequirements that currently apply only to\nGSIBs. This proposal would also impose a long-\nterm debt requirement on certain categories of\ninsured depository institutions, including\ninsured depository institutions with $100\nbillion or more in total assets, such as\nTruist Bank. If adopted, this proposal would\nrequire Truist and Truist Bank to each\nmaintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-\nterm debt amount equal to the largest of (i)\n6% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total\nleverage exposure, and (iii) 3.5% of average\ntotal consolidated assets. Truist Bank would\nbe required to issue the minimum amount of\neligible long-term debt to Truist, and Truist\nwould be required to issue the minimum amount\nof eligible long-term debt externally. In\naddition, if adopted as proposed, the clean\nholding company requirement would limit or\nprohibit Truist from entering into certain\ntransactions that could impede its orderly\nresolution, including, for example,\nprohibiting Truist from entering into\ntransactions that could spread losses to\nsubsidiaries and third parties, as well as\nlimiting the amount of Truist\u2019s liabilities\nthat are not eligible long-term debt. The\ntiming and form of any final rule implementing\nthe long-term debt requirements and clean\nholding company requirements remains\nuncertain.\n                                              \n  Payment of Dividends                        \n                                              \nThe Parent Company is a legal entity separate\nand distinct from its subsidiaries, and it\ndepends in part upon dividends received from\nits direct and indirect subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist Bank, to fund its activities,\nincluding its ability to make capital\ndistributions, such as paying dividends or\nrepurchasing shares. Under federal law, there\nare various limitations on the extent to which\nTruist Bank can declare and pay dividends to\nthe Parent Company, including those related to\nregulatory capital requirements, general\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices, and federal banking law\nrequirements concerning the payment of\ndividends out of net profits, surplus, and\navailable earnings. Certain contractual\nrestrictions also may limit the ability of\nTruist Bank to pay dividends to the Parent\nCompany. No assurances can be given that\nTruist Bank will, in any circumstances, pay\ndividends to the Parent Company.\n\nThe Parent Company\u2019s ability to declare and\npay dividends is similarly limited by federal\nbanking law and FRB regulations and policy.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from\nmaking capital distributions if they would be\ndeemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice.\nThe FRB has indicated generally that it may be\nan unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay\ndividends unless a BHC\u2019s net income is\nsufficient to fund the dividends and the\nexpected rate of earnings retention is\nconsistent with the organization\u2019s capital\nneeds, asset quality, and overall financial\ncondition. In addition, the Parent Company\u2019s\nability to make capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends and repurchasing\nshares, is subject to the FRB\u2019s automatic\nrestrictions on capital distributions under\nthe FRB\u2019s capital rules. Truist\u2019s risk-based\ncapital and leverage ratio requirements are\ndiscussed above in the \u201cCapital Requirements\u201d\nsection.\n\nNorth Carolina law provides that, as long as a\nbank does not make distributions that reduce\nits capital below its applicable required\ncapital, the board of directors of a bank\nchartered under the laws of North Carolina may\ndeclare such distributions as the directors\ndeem proper.\n                                              \n  Prompt Corrective Action                    \n                                              \nThe federal banking agencies are required to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect\nto FDIC-insured depository institutions that\ndo not meet minimum capital requirements. The\nlaw establishes five categories for this\npurpose: \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d\n\u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d To be\nconsidered \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d an IDI must\nmaintain minimum capital ratios and must not\nbe subject to any order or written directive\nto meet and maintain a specific capital level\nfor any capital measure. An institution that\nfails to remain well-capitalized becomes\nsubject to a series of restrictions that\nincrease in severity as its capital condition\nweakens. Such restrictions may include a\nprohibition on capital distributions,\nrestrictions on asset growth, or restrictions\non the ability to receive regulatory approval\nof applications. The regulations apply only to\nbanks and not to BHCs. However, the FRB is\nauthorized to take appropriate action at the\nholding company level, based on the\nundercapitalized status of the holding\ncompany\u2019s subsidiary banking institutions. In\ncertain instances relating to an\nundercapitalized banking institution, the BHC,\nin its capacity as a source of strength would\nbe required to guarantee the performance of\nthe undercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital\nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those\nguarantee commitments.\n\nIn addition, failure to meet capital\nrequirements may cause an institution to be\ndirected to raise additional capital. Federal\nlaw further mandates that the agencies adopt\nsafety and soundness standards generally\nrelating to operations and management, asset\nquality, and executive compensation; and\nauthorizes administrative action against an\ninstitution that fails to meet such standards.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines may subject\na banking organization to a variety of other\nenforcement remedies, including additional\nsubstantial restrictions on its operations and\nactivities, termination of deposit insurance\nby the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver.\n\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Transactions with Affiliates                \n                                              \nThere are various legal restrictions on the\nextent to which Truist and its nonbank\nsubsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in\ncertain types of transactions with Truist\nBank. Under the Federal Reserve Act and FRB\nregulations, Truist Bank and its subsidiaries\nare subject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit, purchases of\nassets, and certain other transactions\ninvolving its nonbank affiliates. In addition,\ntransactions between Truist Bank and its\nnonbank affiliates are required to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                              \n  Acquisitions                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to numerous laws that may\nrequire regulatory approval for acquisitions.\nFor example, under the BHCA, a BHC may not\ndirectly or indirectly acquire ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares\nor substantially all of the assets of any BHC\nor bank or merge or consolidate with another\nBHC without the prior approval of the FRB. The\nBHCA and other federal laws enumerate the\nfactors the FRB must consider when reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC. These factors include the\ncompetitive effects of the proposal in the\nrelevant geographic markets; the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; the effect of the transaction on\nthe financial stability of the U.S.; the\norganizations\u2019 compliance with anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved; and the records of performance under\nthe CRA of the IDIs involved in the\ntransaction.\n\nFederal law authorizes interstate acquisitions\nof banks and BHCs without geographic\nlimitation, and a bank headquartered in one\nstate is authorized to merge with a bank\nheadquartered in another state, subject to\nmarket share limitations, regulatory\napprovals, and any state requirement that the\ntarget bank shall have been in existence and\noperating for a minimum period of time. The\nmarket share limitations impose conditions\nthat the acquiring BHC, after and as a result\nof the acquisition, control no more than 10%\nof the total amount of deposits of IDIs in the\nU.S. and no more than 30%, subject to\nvariation by state law, of such deposits in\napplicable states. FRB rules also prohibit a\nFHC from combining with another company if the\nresulting company\u2019s liabilities would exceed\n10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities\nof all financial companies.\n\nAfter a bank has established branches in a\nstate through an interstate merger\ntransaction, the bank may establish and\nacquire additional branches at any location in\nthe state where a bank headquartered in that\nstate could have established or acquired\nbranches under applicable federal or state\nlaw. These regulatory considerations are\napplicable to privately negotiated acquisition\ntransactions.\n\nThe standards by which bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions are evaluated have\nbeen undergoing review and change by the\nfederal agencies. As a result, it is uncertain\nhow these new policies will be applied.\n\nIn July 2024, the FDIC released a proposed\nrule to amend its regulations under the Change\nin Bank Control Act, which generally provides\nthat no person may directly or indirectly\nacquire control of an insured depository\ninstitution unless the person has given the\nappropriate federal banking agency prior\nnotice of the proposed transaction and the\nagency has not disapproved it. The FDIC\u2019s\nregulations contain a rebuttable presumption\nthat the acquisition of voting securities of a\nholding company like Truist that directly or\nindirectly controls an insured state nonmember\nbank like Truist Bank constitutes such an\nacquisition of control requiring prior notice\nto the FDIC if, immediately after the\ntransaction, the acquiring person will own,\ncontrol, or hold with power to vote 10% or\nmore of any class of voting securities of the\nholding company and other specified conditions\nare met. The proposed rule removes an explicit\nexemption for transactions where the FRB\nreviews a notice under the Change in Bank\nControl Act. We continue to evaluate this\nproposal and its potential impacts, if adopted\nas proposed, on Truist and Truist Bank.\n\nIn September 2024, the FDIC adopted a final\nstatement of policy regarding its review of\nBank Merger Act applications. The final policy\nstatement addresses, among other things, the\nscope of transactions subject to FDIC\napproval, a more rigorous FDIC process for\nevaluating Bank Merger Act applications, and\nthe FDIC Board\u2019s heightened expectations with\nrespect to the Bank Merger Act\u2019s statutory\nfactors. As a result, Bank Merger Act\napplications to the FDIC will now require\nadditional information and transactions that\nwould result in a bank with $100 billion or\nmore in total consolidated assets will be\nsubject to heightened scrutiny. It is unclear\nwhether and how the FDIC will implement its\nfinal statement of policy on bank mergers.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. DOJ clarified that it\nwill assess competition considerations in\nconnection with bank and bank holding company\nmergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines,\nwhich is the general merger review framework\nthe U.S. DOJ now uses to evaluate transactions\nin all segments of the economy, and a newly-\nissued 2024 Banking Addendum (\u201c2024 Banking\nAddendum\u201d). Previously the U.S. DOJ assessed\nbank and bank holding company mergers under\nthe 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, which focused\nprimarily on concentrations of deposits and\nbranches. Since the 2024 Banking Addendum\nallows for consideration of theories of harm\nand relevant markets not considered in the\n1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, it remains\nuncertain how the U.S. DOJ will ultimately\napply this new merger review framework to bank\nmergers.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\n                                              \n  Other Safety and Soundness Regulations      \n                                              \nThe FRB has supervisory and enforcement powers\nover BHCs and their non-banking subsidiaries.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit activities\nthat represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nconstitute violations of law, rule,\nregulation, administrative order, or written\nagreement with a federal regulator. These\npowers may be exercised through the issuance\nof confidential supervisory actions, cease and\ndesist orders, civil monetary penalties, or\nother actions.\n\nThere also are a number of obligations and\nrestrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI\nsubsidiaries by federal law and regulatory\npolicy that are designed to reduce potential\nloss exposure to depositors and the DIF in the\nevent the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of\nbecoming insolvent. For example, the FRB\nrequires a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and\nto commit financial resources to support such\ninstitutions in circumstances where it might\nnot do so otherwise.\n\nBanking regulators also have broad supervisory\nand enforcement powers over Truist Bank,\nincluding the power to impose confidential\nsupervisory actions, fines and other civil and\ncriminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver\nin order to conserve the assets of Truist Bank\nfor the benefit of depositors and other\ncreditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to\ntake possession of a North Carolina state bank\nin certain circumstances, including when it\nappears that such bank has violated its\ncharter or any applicable laws, is conducting\nits business in an unauthorized or unsafe\nmanner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition\nto transact its business or has an impairment\nof its capital stock.\n                                              \n  DIF Assessments                             \n                                              \nTruist Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC\nup to the applicable limits, which is\ncurrently $250,000 per account ownership type.\nThe FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium\nassessment system that determines assessment\nrates for an IDI based on an assessment rate\ncalculator, which is based on a number of\nelements to measure the risk each IDI poses to\nthe DIF. The assessment rate is applied to\ntotal average assets less tangible equity, as\ndefined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The\nassessment rate schedule can change from time\nto time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject\nto certain limits. Under the current system,\npremiums are assessed quarterly.\n\nThe FDIC implemented a special assessment to\nrecoup losses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in 2023. The assessment is based on\nan insured depository institution\u2019s estimated\nuninsured deposits reported as of December 31,\n2022. The special assessment for Truist Bank\nwas $64 million and $507 million for the years\nended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Truist Bank may be subject to\nadditional adjustments due to change in the\nestimated relevant losses to the DIF reported\nby the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided\nnotification that the collection period will\nbe extended an additional two quarters beyond\nthe initial eight quarterly installments. The\nspecial assessment will be paid in ten\nquarterly installments, which began in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley\nBank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank,\nwhich could result in additional expense.\n                                              \n  Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations    \n                                              \nIn connection with its lending and leasing\nactivities, Truist Bank is subject to federal\nand state laws designed to protect borrowers\nand promote lending to various sectors of the\neconomy and population. The CFPB examines\nTruist and Truist Bank for compliance with a\nbroad range of federal consumer financial laws\nand regulations, including the laws and\nregulations that relate to deposit products,\ncredit card, mortgage, automobile, student,\nand other consumer loans, and other consumer\nfinancial products and services offered. The\nfederal consumer financial protection laws\nthat are subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervision and\nenforcement powers include, among others, the\nTruth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act,\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collection Practices Act, and Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act. The CFPB also has\nauthority to take enforcement actions to\nprevent and remedy acts and practices relating\nto consumer financial products and services\nthat it deems to be unfair, deceptive, or\nabusive, and to impose new disclosure\nrequirements for any consumer financial\nproduct or service.\n\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn October 2024, the CFPB finalized a rule\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires\ncertain entities, including Truist and Truist\nBank, to, among other things, make available\nto a consumer, upon request, information in\nits control or possession concerning the\nconsumer financial product or service that the\nconsumer obtained from that entity. The rule\nalso requires data providers holding a\nconsumer account, such as Truist Bank, to\nestablish a developer interface satisfying\ncertain data security specifications and other\nstandards, through which the data provider can\nreceive requests for, and provide, specific\ntypes of data covered by the rule in\nelectronic, usable form to authorized third\nparties, including data aggregators. Data\nproviders are prohibited from charging\nconsumers or third parties fees for processing\nthese consumer data requests. The rule also\nplaces certain data security, authorization,\nand other obligations on third parties\naccessing covered data from data providers,\nwhich could include Truist and Truist Bank\nwhen acting in certain capacities. The rule\nalso requires such third parties to limit\ntheir collection, use, and retention of the\ndata received from the applicable data\nprovider to only what is reasonably necessary\nto provide the applicable consumer\u2019s requested\nproduct or service, including uses that are\nreasonably necessary to improve the product or\nservice. The compliance date for a data\nprovider that is a depository institution with\nover $250 billion in total assets is April 1,\n2026; however, the final rule is subject to\nongoing litigation that could impact whether\nand when Truist and Truist Bank are required\nto comply with the rule. We continue to\nevaluate the final rule and the potential\nimpacts on Truist and Truist Bank.\n\nThe CFPB may issue additional regulations that\nimpact products and services offered by Truist\nor Truist Bank. The regulations could reduce\nthe fees that Truist and Truist Bank receives,\nalter the way products and services are\nprovided, or increase the risk of private\nlitigation or regulatory enforcement action.\n                                              \n  BSA and Patriot Act                         \n                                              \nFinancial institutions, including Truist Bank,\nare subject to the anti-money laundering and\ncountering the financing of terrorism\nrequirements of the BSA and its implementing\nregulations. The BSA was amended by the\nPatriot Act to strengthen the ability of U.S.\nlaw enforcement agencies and intelligence\ncommunities to cooperate in the prevention,\ndetection, and prosecution of international\nmoney laundering and the financing of\nterrorism and was further amended by the Anti-\nMoney Laundering Act of 2020. The BSA, as\namended, contains anti-money laundering\nmeasures affecting IDIs, broker-dealers and\ncertain other financial institutions. The BSA\nrequires those financial institutions to\nimplement policies and procedures to combat\nmoney laundering and the financing of\nterrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S.\nTreasury broad authority to issue regulations\nand to impose requirements and restrictions on\nfinancial institutions\u2019 operations. The BSA\nfurther imposes substantial obligations on\nfinancial institutions to maintain appropriate\npolicies, procedures, and processes to detect,\nprevent, and report money laundering,\nterrorist financing, and other financial\ncrimes. Failure to comply with these\nregulations may result in fines, penalties,\nlawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputational\ndamage, or restrictions on business. In\naddition, the Patriot Act requires the federal\nbank regulatory agencies to consider the\neffectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s\nanti-money laundering activities when\nreviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.\n                                              \n  BSA/AML and Sanctions                       \n                                              \nFinancial institutions that are subject to the\nBSA are subject to examinations and ongoing\nmonitoring to assess compliance with BSA/AML\nand OFAC laws and regulations.

In general,\nthe statute requires that financial\ninstitutions provide explanations to consumers\non their policies and procedures regarding the\ndisclosure of such nonpublic personal\ninformation and, except as otherwise required\nby law, prohibits disclosing such personal\ninformation except as provided in the\nfinancial institution\u2019s policies and\nprocedures.\n\nA joint regulation from the FRB, OCC, and FDIC\nrequires a banking organization to notify its\nprimary federal regulators as soon as possible\nand within 36 hours after identifying a\n\u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d that the banking\norganization believes in good faith has\nmaterially disrupted or degraded, or is\nreasonably likely to materially disrupt or\ndegrade its business or operations in a manner\nthat would, among other things, jeopardize the\nviability of its operations, result in\ncustomers being unable to access their deposit\nand other accounts, result in a material loss\nof revenue, profit or stock price, or pose a\nthreat to the financial stability of the U.S.\n\nIn addition, once implementing regulations are\nfinalized, the Cyber Incident Reporting for\nCritical Infrastructure Act (\u201cCIRCIA\u201d) will\nrequire, among other things, covered entities\nto report significant cyber incidents,\nincluding ransomware attacks, to the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (\u201cCISA\u201d) within 72 hours from the time\nthe covered entity reasonably believes the\nincident occurred (and within 24 hours of\nmaking a ransom payment as a result of a\nransomware attack). The CISA proposed a rule\nunder the CIRCIA in April 2024 that would\nclarify the scope of cyber incidents to be\nreported and would further define covered\nentities subject to the CIRCIA to include\nbanking organizations like Truist.\n\nTruist\u2019s nonbank subsidiaries are also subject\nto rules and regulations issued by the Federal\nTrade Commission, which regulates unfair or\ndeceptive acts or practices, including with\nrespect to data privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has\nrecently considered, and is expected to\ncontinue to consider various proposals for,\nmore comprehensive data privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity legislation.\n\nLike other lenders, Truist Bank uses credit\nbureau data in its underwriting activities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates\nreporting information to credit bureaus,\nprescreening individuals for credit offers,\nsharing of information between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate data for marketing purposes.\nSimilar state laws may impose additional\nrequirements on Truist Bank.\n\nStates are also increasingly proposing or\nenacting legislation that relates to data\nprivacy, data protection, and cybersecurity\nsuch as the California Consumer Privacy Act as\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act.\nTruist may be subject to similar laws in other\nstates where Truist does business or in states\nwhere Truist may collect personal information\nof residents. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S.\nstates generally require businesses to provide\nnotice under certain circumstances to\nindividuals whose personal information has\nbeen disclosed as a result of a data breach.\n\nMoreover, the New York Department of Financial\nServices Cybersecurity Regulation is driving\nsignificant cybersecurity compliance\nactivities for Truist. This regulation\nincludes phased compliance periods as well as\nattestation of compliance by certain Truist\nentities.\n\nTruist has undertaken significant efforts to\ncomply with these laws and regulations and\ncontinues to assess their requirements and\napplicability to Truist. These laws and\nregulations, as well as proposed legislation\nand regulation, are subject to revision or\nformal guidance and may be interpreted or\napplied in a manner inconsistent with the\nCompany\u2019s understanding, which may result in\nfurther uncertainty and require Truist to\nincur additional costs to comply. Refer to\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information\non the risks related to compliance with\napplicable privacy laws and regulations.\n                                              \n  CRA                                         \n                                              \nThe CRA requires the FDIC to assess the bank\u2019s\nrecord in meeting the credit needs of the\ncommunities served by the bank, including low-\nand moderate-income neighborhoods and persons.\nInstitutions are assigned one of four ratings:\n\u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to\nImprove,\u201d or \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d This\nassessment is considered for any bank that\napplies to merge or consolidate with or\nacquire the assets or assume the liabilities\nof an IDI, or to open or relocate a branch\noffice. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank\nof a FHC also is assessed by the FRB in\nconnection with the review of any proposed\nacquisition or merger application. For its\nmost recent CRA examination period, Truist\nBank received the highest possible overall\nrating of \u201cOutstanding\u201d from the FDIC.\n\n14 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn October 2023, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued\na final rule to amend their regulations\nimplementing the CRA. The rule materially\nrevises the current CRA framework, including\nthe assessment areas in which a bank is\nevaluated to include activities associated\nwith online and mobile banking, the tests used\nto evaluate the bank in its assessment areas,\nnew methods of calculating credit for lending,\ninvestment, and service activities, and\nadditional data collection and reporting\nrequirements. The rule was expected to result\nin a significant increase in the thresholds\nfor large banks to receive \u201cOutstanding\u201d\nratings in the future. The rule was expected\nto take effect on April 1, 2024, with most of\nthe provisions becoming applicable on January\n1, 2026. Reporting of the collected data will\nnot be required until 2027. Several banking\nindustry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to\ninvalidate the CRA final rule, in which they\nargued that the federal banking agencies\nexceeded their statutory authority. In March\n2024, a federal judge granted an injunction to\nextend the CRA final rule\u2019s effective date.\nThe effective date will be extended each day\nthe injunction remains in place, pending the\nresolution of the lawsuit. It is unknown\nwhether and when the CRA final rule will\nbecome effective.\n                                              \n  Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation      \n                                              \nThere are federal consumer protection laws\nrelated to automated overdraft payment\nprograms offered by financial institutions.\nThe CFPB prohibits financial institutions from\ncharging consumers fees for paying overdrafts\non automated teller machine and one-time debit\ncard transactions, unless a consumer consents,\nor opts in, to the overdraft service.\nFinancial institutions must also provide\nconsumers with a notice that explains the\nfinancial institution\u2019s overdraft services,\nincluding the associated fees and the\nconsumer\u2019s choices. In addition, FDIC-\nsupervised institutions must monitor overdraft\npayment programs for \u201cexcessive or chronic\u201d\nclient use and undertake \u201cmeaningful and\neffective\u201d follow-up action with clients that\noverdraw their accounts more than six times\nduring a rolling 12-month period. Financial\ninstitutions must also impose daily limits on\noverdraft charges, review and modify check-\nclearing procedures, prominently distinguish\naccount balances from available overdraft\ncoverage amounts, and provide for board and\nmanagement oversight regarding overdraft\npayment programs. In response to direct client\nfeedback, Truist offers checking accounts that\nare not subject to overdraft fees.\n\nIn December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule\nto financial institutions with more than $10\nbillion in assets to either limit the cost of\noverdraft services to the amount of their\ncosts and losses, or adhere to a fee cap of\n$5. The rule was expected to take effect on\nOctober 1, 2025. Several banking industry\ngroups seeking to invalidate the rule through\nlitigation are arguing, among other things,\nthat the CFPB did not have the statutory\nauthority to issue the rule under the Truth in\nLending Act. It is unknown whether the\nlitigation or other government actions in the\nfuture will impact the effective date or\nsubstance of the rule.\n                                              \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nTruist is prohibited under the Volcker Rule\nfrom (i) engaging in proprietary trading\nactivities, and (ii) having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with covered\nprivate funds. The fundamental prohibitions of\nthe Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of\nany size, including Truist and its affiliates.\nThe Volcker Rule regulations contain\nexemptions or exclusions, including for\nmarket-making, hedging, underwriting, trading\nin U.S. government and agency obligations, and\nalso permit certain ownership interests in\ncertain types of funds. They also permit the\noffering and sponsoring of funds under certain\nconditions. Truist maintains compliance\nprograms in response to the significant\ncompliance obligations mandated by the Volcker\nRule regulations.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Regime for Swaps                 \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive\nregulatory regime for the OTC swaps market,\naimed at increasing transparency, and reducing\nsystemic risk in the derivatives markets,\nincluding requirements for central clearing,\nexchange trading, capital adequacy, margin,\nreporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank\nAct requires that certain swap dealers and\nsecurity-based swap dealers register with one\nor both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the\nnature of the swaps business. Truist Bank is\nregistered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and\nis conditionally registered with the SEC as a\nsecurity-based swap dealer, subjecting Truist\nBank to requirements under the CFTC\u2019s and\nSEC\u2019s regulatory regimes. This includes trade\nreporting and recordkeeping requirements,\nbusiness conduct requirements (including daily\nvaluations, disclosure of material risks\nassociated with swaps and disclosure of\nmaterial incentives and conflicts of\ninterest), and mandatory clearing and exchange\ntrading requirements for certain standardized\nswaps designated by the CFTC. The NFA is the\nprimary self-regulatory organization for\nTruist\u2019s swap dealer. Truist Bank\u2019s uncleared\nswaps and security-based swaps are subject to\nvariation margin and initial margin\nrequirements.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 15\n                                              \n  Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser        \n  Regulation                                  \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulation by the\nSEC. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory\norganization for Truist\u2019s registered broker-\ndealer subsidiaries. Truist\u2019s broker-dealer\nand investment adviser subsidiaries also are\nsubject to additional regulation by states or\nlocal jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have\nactive enforcement functions that oversee\nbroker-dealers and investment advisers and can\nbring actions that result in fines,\nrestitution, a limitation on permitted\nactivities, disqualification to continue to\nconduct certain activities and an inability to\nrely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain\ntypes of infractions and violations also can\naffect Truist\u2019s ability to issue new\nsecurities expeditiously. In addition, certain\nchanges in the activities of a broker-dealer\nrequire approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes\ninto account a variety of considerations in\nacting upon applications for such approval,\nincluding internal controls, capital levels,\nmanagement experience and quality, prior\nenforcement and disciplinary history, and\nsupervisory concerns.\n                                              \n  FDIC Recordkeeping Requirements             \n                                              \nTruist is subject to certain enhanced deposit\ninsurance recordkeeping requirements adopted\nby the FDIC. To facilitate prompt payment of\nFDIC-insured deposits when large IDIs fail,\nFDIC rules require IDIs with two million or\nmore deposit accounts to maintain complete and\naccurate data on each depositor\u2019s ownership\ninterest by right and capacity and to develop\nthe capability to calculate the insured and\nuninsured amounts for each deposit owner by\nownership right and capacity.\n                                              \n  Other Regulatory Matters                    \n                                              \nTruist is subject to examinations by federal\nand state banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFTC, FINRA, NFA, various taxing\nauthorities, and various state securities\nregulators.

           \nThe following discussion sets forth some of\nthe more important risk factors that could\nmaterially affect Truist\u2019s financial condition\nand operations. When a risk factor spans\nseveral risk categories, the risks have been\nlisted by their primary risk category. The\nrisks described are not all inclusive.\nAdditional risks that are not presently known\nor risks deemed immaterial may have an adverse\neffect on Truist\u2019s financial condition,\nresults of operations, business, and\nprospects.\n                                              \n  Market Risks                                \n                                              \nThe levels of or changes in interest rates\ncould adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nWe are highly dependent on net interest\nincome, which is the difference between\ninterest income on earning assets, such as\nloans and investments, and interest expense on\ndeposits and borrowings. Net interest income\nis significantly affected by market rates of\ninterest, which in turn are influenced by\nmonetary and fiscal policies, general economic\nand market conditions, including heightened\nlevels of inflation, the political and\nregulatory environments, business and consumer\nsentiment, competitive pressures, and\nexpectations about the future, including\nfuture changes in interest rates and the\nfrequency and timing of such changes. Refer to\nthe later risk factor titled Changes in\nmonetary, fiscal, and other policies, and\nchanges in the U.S. political environment,\ncould adversely affect us. Our net interest\nincome has in the past been adversely affected\nand could in the future be adversely affected\nby policies, laws, and events that have the\neffect of flattening or inverting the yield\ncurve (that is, the difference between long-\nterm and short-term interest rates),\ndepressing the interest rates associated with\nour earning assets to levels near the rates\nassociated with our interest expense,\nincreasing the volatility of market rates of\ninterest, including the rate of change, or\nchanging the spreads among different interest\nrate indices.\n\nThe levels of or changes in interest rates\ncould adversely affect us beyond our net\ninterest income, including by increasing the\ncost or decreasing the availability of\ndeposits or other variable-rate funding\ninstruments, reducing the yield on or demand\nfor loans or increasing the prepayment speed\nof loans, increasing client or counterparty\ndelinquencies or defaults, and reducing the\nvalue of our loans, retained interests in\nsecuritizations, and fixed-income securities\nin our investment portfolio and the efficacy\nof our hedging strategies. Certain of our\ninvestment securities, notably MBS, are\nsensitive to changes in rates. Generally, when\nrates rise, market values will decline,\nprepayments of principal will decrease and the\nduration of MBS will increase. Conversely,\nwhen rates fall, market values will rise,\nprepayments of principal will increase and the\nduration of MBS will decrease.\n\nThe levels of and changes in market rates of\ninterest, and the related risks and\nuncertainties, are beyond our control. The\ndynamics among these risks and uncertainties\nare also challenging to assess and manage. For\nexample, while an accommodative monetary\npolicy may benefit us to some degree by\nspurring economic activity among our clients,\nsuch a policy may ultimately cause us more\nharm by inhibiting our ability to grow or\nsustain net interest income. A heightened\ninterest rate environment, which we have\nexperienced in recent years and may continue\nto experience, can pose different challenges,\nsuch as potentially slowing the demand for\ncredit, increasing delinquencies and defaults,\nand reducing the values of our loans and fixed\nincome securities. Market volatility in\ninterest rates, including the rate of change,\ncan create particularly difficult conditions.\nRefer to the \u201cMarket Risk\u201d section of the MD&A\nand \u201cNote 19. Derivative Financial\nInstruments.\u201d\n\nThe Company\u2019s hedging strategies may not be\nsuccessful in mitigating our interest rate,\nforeign exchange, and market risks, which\ncould adversely affect our financial results.\n\nThe Company employs various hedging strategies\nto mitigate the interest rate, foreign\nexchange, and market risks inherent in many of\nour assets and liabilities. The Company\u2019s\nhedging strategies rely considerably on\nassumptions and projections regarding our\nassets and liabilities as well as general\nmarket factors. If any of these assumptions or\nprojections prove to be incorrect or our\nhedges do not adequately mitigate the impact\nof changes in interest rates, foreign exchange\nrates, and other market factors, the Company\nmay experience volatility in our earnings that\ncould adversely affect our profitability and\nfinancial condition. In addition, the Company\nmay not be able to find market participants\nthat are willing to act as its hedging\ncounterparties on acceptable terms or at all,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on the\nsuccess of our hedging strategies. The\nCompany\u2019s hedging strategies are not designed\nto eliminate all interest rate, foreign\nexchange, and market risks.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nChanges in monetary, fiscal, and other\npolicies, and changes in the U.S. political\nenvironment, could adversely affect us.\n\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies,\nincluding those established by the FRB and\nother central banks, and uncertainty\nconcerning the future path of interest rates,\ngovernment shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding\nfor the government, and tariffs and other\ntrade policies, can cause volatility in the\nfinancial markets and adversely affect our\nbusiness and operations\u2014for example, the\nconditions for commercial and consumer\nlending, the creditworthiness of our clients,\nthe cost of our deposits and other interest-\nbearing liabilities, and the yield on our\nearning assets. Truist cannot control or\npredict the nature or timing of future changes\nin monetary, fiscal, or other policies or the\nprecise effects such changes may have on the\nCompany\u2019s activities and financial results.\nThese policies can:\n\n\u2022 Meaningfully influence the availability and\ndemand for loans and deposits, the rates and\nother terms for loans and deposits, and the\nconditions in equity, fixed-income, currency,\nand other markets;\n\n\u2022 Significantly impact the cost of funds, as\nwell as the return on assets, both of which\ncan have an impact on interest income;\n\n\u2022 Adversely affect borrowers through higher\ndebt servicing costs and potentially increase\nthe risk they may fail to repay their loan\nobligations; and\n\n\u2022 Artificially inflate asset values during\nprolonged periods of accommodative policy,\nwhich could in turn cause volatile markets and\nrapidly declining collateral values during\ntimes of restrictive monetary and fiscal\npolicies.\n\nA fractious or volatile political environment\nin the U.S., including any related social\nunrest, could negatively impact business and\nmarket conditions, economic growth, financial\nstability, and business, consumer, investor,\nand regulatory sentiments, any one or more of\nwhich in turn could cause our business and\nfinancial results to suffer. We also could be\nnegatively impacted by political scrutiny of\nthe financial services industry in general or\nour business or operations in particular.\n\nFinancial results, lending, and other business\nactivities could be adversely affected by weak\nor deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nOur businesses are driven by robust economic\nand market activity, monetary and fiscal\nstability, and positive investor, business,\nand consumer sentiment. A prolonged period of\nslow growth in the U.S. economy as a whole or\nin any regional markets that Truist serves, or\nany deterioration in economic conditions or\nthe financial markets, may disrupt or dampen\nthe economy, which could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition and results.\n\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, the\nCompany could see lower demand for loans by\ncreditworthy clients, reducing the Company\u2019s\ninterest income. In addition, if unemployment\nlevels increase or if real estate prices\ndecrease, the Company could incur higher\ncharge-offs and could incur higher expenses\ndue to increased credit loss provisions. These\nconditions may adversely affect not only\nconsumer borrowers but also commercial and\nindustrial and commercial real estate\nborrowers, especially for those businesses\nthat rely on the health of industries or\nproperties that may suffer from deteriorating\neconomic conditions. The ability of these\nborrowers to repay their loans may be reduced,\ncausing the Company to incur higher credit\nlosses. In addition, inflation may lead to a\ndecrease in consumer and clients\u2019 purchasing\npower, and adversely affect demand for our\nproducts and services, reducing the Company\u2019s\nincome.\n\nA weakening or deterioration of economic\nconditions also could adversely affect\nfinancial results for the Company\u2019s fee-based\nbusinesses. Truist earns fee income from,\namong other activities, investment banking,\nmanaging assets for clients, and providing\nbrokerage and other investment advisory and\nwealth management services. Investment\nmanagement fees are often based on the value\nof assets under management and a decrease in\nthe market prices of those assets could reduce\nthe Company\u2019s fee income. Changes in stock or\nfixed income market prices or client\npreferences could affect the trading activity\nof investors, reducing commissions and other\nfees earned from the Company\u2019s brokerage\nbusiness. Poor economic conditions and\nvolatile or unstable financial markets would\nlikely adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nfinancial advisory and capital markets-related\nbusinesses.\n\nIn addition, the bank failures in 2023 focused\nmarket attention on the industry\u2019s interest\nrate and deposit risks due to rapidly rising\ninterest rates, which, among other things,\nresulted in unrealized losses on longer\nduration securities and loans held by banks. A\ndecrease in the supply of deposits or\nsignificant increase in competition for\ndeposits could result in substantial increases\nin costs to retain and service deposits.\nIncreased adoption of consumer banking\ntechnology can result in reduced deposit\ndemand due to the relative ease with which\ndepositors may transfer deposits to a\ndifferent depository institution in the event\nthat the Bank\u2019s products and services are less\ncompetitive or confidence is lost in the Bank.\nThe cost of resolving the bank failures in\n2023 also prompted the FDIC to issue a special\nassessment to recover costs to the DIF. Refer\nto the \u201cRegulatory Considerations\u201d section in\nItem 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d for additional details\nrelated to the FDIC\u2019s special assessment.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 23\nGeopolitical conditions, the outbreak or\nescalation of hostilities, acts or threats of\nterrorism, and related volatility and\ninstability in global economic and market\nconditions could adversely affect us.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have an adverse\neffect on the Company\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition. In addition,\ndisruptions in foreign relations of the U.S.\ncould adversely affect industries and markets\non which our business depends. The\nmacroeconomic environment in the U.S. is\nsusceptible to geopolitical events and\nvolatility in financial markets. For example,\ntrade and other negotiations between the U.S.\nand other nations remain uncertain and could\nadversely impact economic and market\nconditions for the Company and its clients and\ncounterparties.\n\nGeopolitical conditions, including tensions in\nforeign relations of the U.S., the outbreak or\nescalation of hostilities between countries or\nwithin a country or region, and acts or\nthreats of terrorism, could have an adverse\neffect on the global economy, financial\nmarkets, and on Truist\u2019s business operations.\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or\ngroups, including armed conflict or\nintensified cyberattacks, could expand or\nescalate in unpredictable ways, with\npotentially catastrophic consequences.\nGeopolitical events and instability could\nresult in worldwide economic disruption,\nheightened volatility in financial markets,\nsevere declines in asset values, disruption of\nglobal trade and supply chains, higher and\nmore volatile commodity and food prices, and\ndiminished consumer, business, and investor\nconfidence. Any of the above consequences\ncould have significant negative effects on the\nU.S. economy, and, as a result, Truist\u2019s\noperations and earnings. Truist, its service\nproviders, and participants in the financial\nsystem could also experience increasing levels\nand more aggressive cyberattacks launched by\nor under the sponsorship of one or more of the\nadversaries in such a conflict.\n                                              \n  Credit Risks                                \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to credit risk, and the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not\nbe adequate to cover realized and future\nlosses.\n\nTruist incurs credit risk, which is the risk\nto current or anticipated earnings or capital\narising when a borrower, obligor, issuer, or\ncounterparty does not meet its financial\nobligations to us. Credit risk is primarily\nincurred through lending activities in the\nCompany\u2019s WB and CSBB operating segments. A\nnumber of products expose the Company to\ncredit risk, including loans and leases,\nlending commitments, derivatives, trading\nassets, and investment securities. Changes in\ncredit quality can have a significant impact\non the Company\u2019s earnings and capital\nposition. The Company estimates and\nestablishes contractual lifetime reserves for\ncredit risks and credit losses inherent in its\ndetermination of credit exposure. This\nprocess, which is critical to the Company\u2019s\nfinancial results and condition, requires\ncomplex calculations and extensive use of\njudgment, considering both external and\nborrower-specific factors that might impair\nthe ability of borrowers to repay their loans.\nIf the Company fails to identify all pertinent\nfactors, or fails to accurately estimate the\nimpacts of factors identified, the Company\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses may not be\nadequate to cover realized and future losses.\n\nCredit losses may exceed the amount of the\nCompany\u2019s reserves due to changing economic\nconditions, falling collateral values, falling\ncommodity prices, higher unemployment, losses\non a client / sector where Truist has an\noutsized exposure, or other factors such as\nchanges in borrower behavior. There is no\nassurance that reserves will be sufficient to\ncover all credit losses. In the event of\nsignificant deterioration in current or\nprojected future economic conditions, the\nCompany could experience reduced demand for\ncredit and increased delinquencies or\ndefaults. In addition, the Company could be\nrequired to increase reserves in future\nperiods, which would reduce the Company\u2019s\nearnings and potentially impact its capital.\n\nThe Company could have more credit risk and\nhigher credit losses if our underwriting\nstandards and practices are inadequate, we\nadopt more liberal underwriting standards for\ncompetitive or other reasons, or our\nconcentration and other risk limits are not\nwell calibrated.\n\nThe Company\u2019s credit risk and credit losses\ncan increase if the Company\u2019s loans are\nconcentrated in borrowers engaged in the same\nor similar activities or in borrowers who as a\ngroup may be uniquely or disproportionately\naffected by economic conditions or market\nconditions, including as a result of climate\nchange or natural disasters. Increased\ndelinquencies or defaults could also result\nfrom our failing to appropriately underwrite\nloans and other products that we originate or\npurchase or from our adopting\u2014for strategic,\ncompetitive, or other reasons\u2014more liberal\nunderwriting standards. There can be no\nassurance that our forecasts of economic\nconditions, our assessments and monitoring of\ncredit risk, and our efforts to mitigate\ncredit risk through risk-based pricing,\nappropriate underwriting and investment\npolicies, loss-mitigation strategies, and\ndiversification are or will be sufficient to\nprevent an adverse impact to our business and\nfinancial results.\n\nThe Company may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in weak, deteriorating, or\nstressed economic or market conditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or\nilliquidity, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be\nfurther increased if it fails to realize the\nexpected value of the collateral it holds,\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are\nnot sufficient to recover the full amount owed\nto Truist, or counterparties are unable to\npost collateral, whether for operational or\nother reasons. Furthermore, disputes with\ncounterparties concerning the valuation of\ncollateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility, or\nilliquidity, and Truist could suffer losses\nduring these periods if it is unable to obtain\nadditional collateral from counterparties,\nmanage declines in the value of collateral, or\nrealize the expected value of collateral.\n\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risks                             \n                                              \nOur inability to retain and grow deposits or a\nchange in deposit costs or mix could\nnegatively impact our funding strategy and\nfinancial results.\n\nDeposits are a relatively low cost and stable\nsource of funding. Truist competes with banks\nand other financial institutions for deposits\nand as a result, the Company could lose\ndeposits in the future, clients may shift\ntheir deposits into higher yielding or\nalternate savings vehicles, or the Company may\nneed to raise interest rates to avoid deposit\nattrition. Funding costs may also increase if\ndeposits lost are replaced with wholesale\nfunding. Higher funding costs reduce Truist\u2019s\nnet interest margin, net interest income, and\nnet income. For example, in 2024, maintaining\nand growing deposits continued to be\nchallenging with the FRB continuing to reduce\nthe size of its balance sheet through\nquantitative tightening and sustained\nincreased interest rates giving clients an\nincentive to move deposits to money market\nfunds and other higher-yielding alternatives.\nIn addition, our ability to maintain, grow, or\nfavorably price deposits may be constrained by\ngaps in our product and service offerings,\nchanges in consumer trends, our scale relative\nto other financial institutions, competition\nfrom fintech companies and emerging financial-\nservices providers, any failures or\ndeterioration in our client service, or any\nloss of confidence in our brand or our\nbusiness.\n\nTruist\u2019s liquidity could be impaired by an\ninability to access short-term funding, an\nunforeseen outflow of cash, or an inability to\nmonetize liquid assets.\n\nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in\nassets and meet obligations as they come due,\nall without incurring unacceptable costs.\nBanks are especially vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk because of their reliance on demand or\nshort-term deposits to fund longer-term loans\nor other extensions of credit. We, like other\nfinancial-services companies, rely to a\nsignificant extent on external sources of\nfunding, such as deposits and borrowings, for\nthe liquidity needed to conduct our business\nand operations. A number of factors beyond our\ncontrol, however, could have a detrimental\nimpact on the availability or cost of that\nfunding and thus on our liquidity. When\nvolatility or disruptions occur in the\nwholesale funding markets, the Company\u2019s\nability to access short-term liquidity could\nbe impaired. In addition, idiosyncratic\nfactors, including realization of other risks\ndescribed herein, as well as other factors\noutside of the Company\u2019s control, such as a\ngeneral market disruption or an operational\nproblem that affects third parties, could\nimpair the Company\u2019s ability to access short-\nterm or contingent funding sources or create\nan unforeseen outflow of cash due to, among\nother factors, draws on unfunded commitments\nor deposit attrition. The Company\u2019s inability\nto monetize liquid assets without unacceptable\nlosses or to access short-term funding or\ncapital markets could constrain the Company\u2019s\nability to make new loans or meet existing\nlending commitments and could ultimately\njeopardize the Company\u2019s overall liquidity and\ncapitalization. While our policies and\ncontrols are designed to enable us to maintain\nadequate liquidity to conduct our business in\nthe ordinary course even in a stressed\nenvironment, our liquidity position could\nstill become compromised. Such an event could\ndamage the performance and value of our\nbusiness, prompt regulatory intervention and\nprivate litigation, harm our reputation, and\ncause a loss of client and investor\nconfidence, and if the condition were to\npersist for any appreciable period of time,\nour viability as a going concern could be\nthreatened.\n\nA disruption in our access to the mortgage\nsecondary market and GSEs for liquidity could\nnegatively affect us.\n\nTruist sells a portion of the mortgage loans\nthat it originates to reduce the Company\u2019s\nretained credit risk and to provide funding\ncapacity for originating additional loans. The\nGSEs could limit their purchases of conforming\nloans due to capital constraints or other\nchanges in their eligibility criteria for\nconforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or\nborrower eligibility). This potential\nreduction in purchases could limit the\nCompany\u2019s ability to fund new loans.\n\nProposals have been presented to reform the\nhousing finance market in the U.S., including\nthe role of the GSEs in the housing finance\nmarket. The extent and timing of any such\nregulatory reform of the housing finance\nmarket and the GSEs, as well as any effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business and financial results,\nare uncertain.\n\nThe Company\u2019s cost of funding or access to the\nbanking and capital markets could be adversely\naffected if our credit ratings are downgraded\nor otherwise fail to meet investor\nexpectations.\n\nCredit ratings are influenced by many factors,\nincluding the Company\u2019s profitability, asset\nquality, capital levels, liquidity, business\nmix, operations, and risk management\npractices. Credit ratings may also be\ninfluenced by other factors, some of which are\noutside the Company\u2019s control, such as recent\nand anticipated economic trends, geopolitical\nrisk, legislative and regulatory developments,\nincluding implied levels of government support\nduring a crisis, environmental, social, and\ngovernance considerations, and litigation, as\nwell as changes to the rating agencies\u2019\nmethodologies. There can be no assurance we\nwill be able to maintain our current ratings\nand outlooks. Truist\u2019s failure to maintain\ncredit ratings could adversely affect funding\ncosts and increase the Company\u2019s cost of\ncapital. A ratings downgrade could affect the\nCompany\u2019s ability to attract or retain\nfunding, including deposits from commercial\nand corporate clients. Additionally, a\ndowngrade to Truist\u2019s credit ratings might\nalso adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to\nconduct derivatives business with certain\nclients and counterparties and could trigger\nobligations to make cash or collateral\npayments to certain clients and\ncounterparties.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\nThe Parent Company could have less access to\nfunding sources and its liquidity could be\nconstrained if the Bank becomes unable to pay\ndividends.\n\nThe Parent Company relies upon capital markets\naccess and dividends from affiliates for\nfunding and has less access to contingent\nfunding sources than the Bank. If the Bank\nwere subject to a financial stress, its\ndividends to the Parent Company could be\nreduced or eliminated in order to support Bank\ncapital ratios or other regulatory\nrequirements. This would increase the Parent\nCompany\u2019s reliance on capital markets at a\ntime when credit spreads and funding costs are\nlikely elevated due to the stress impacting\nthe Bank and would also impair the Parent\nCompany\u2019s ability to serve as a source of\nstrength to its subsidiaries.\n\nThe financial system is highly interrelated,\nand financial or systemic shocks or the\nfailure of even a single financial institution\nor other participant in the financial system\ncould adversely impact us.\n\nAdverse developments affecting the overall\nstrength and soundness of other financial\ninstitutions, the financial services industry\nas a whole, the macroeconomic climate, and the\nU.S. Treasury market could have a negative\nimpact on perceptions about the strength and\nsoundness of our business even if we are not\nsubject to the same adverse developments. In\naddition, adverse developments with respect to\nthird parties with whom we have important\nrelationships could also negatively impact\nperceptions about us. These perceptions about\nus could cause our business to be negatively\naffected and exacerbate the other risks that\nwe face.\n\nTruist may be impacted by actual or perceived\nsoundness of other financial institutions,\nincluding as a result of the financial or\noperational failure of a major financial\ninstitution, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a financial\ninstitution or its ability to fulfill its\nobligations, which can cause substantial and\ncascading disruption within the financial\nmarkets and increased expenses, including FDIC\ninsurance premiums or special assessments, and\ncould affect our ability to attract and retain\ndepositors and to borrow or raise capital. The\nfailure of other banks and financial\ninstitutions and the measures taken by\ngovernments, businesses, and other\norganizations in response to these events\ncould adversely impact the Company\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition, and results of\noperations.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine\nfunding transactions could be adversely\naffected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are\ninterrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty, and other relationships. Truist\nhas exposure to many different industries and\ncounterparties and routinely executes\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial industry, including brokers and\ndealers, central counterparties, commercial\nbanks, investment banks, mutual and hedge\nfunds, and other institutional investors and\nclients. As a result, defaults by, or even\nrumors or questions about, one or more\nfinancial services institutions or the\nfinancial services industry generally, in the\npast have led to market-wide liquidity\nproblems and could lead to losses or defaults\nby Truist or by other institutions. Many of\nthese transactions expose the Company to\ncredit risk in the event of default of the\nCompany\u2019s counterparty or client. In addition,\nthe Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated\nwhen the collateral held by Truist cannot be\nliquidated or is liquidated at prices not\nsufficient to recover the full amount of the\nCompany\u2019s exposure. Any such losses could\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition.\n                                              \n  Technology Risks                            \n                                              \nThe Company\u2019s operating systems and\ninfrastructure, as well as operational\ncapabilities managed or supplied by third\nparties on whom we rely, could fail or be\ninterrupted, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and adversely impact the Company\u2019s\noperations, financial condition, prospects,\nand reputation, and cause significant legal\nand financial exposure.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operational and security\nsystems, networks, and infrastructure,\nincluding computer systems and networks, data\nmanagement, and internal processes, as well as\nthose of third parties, are integral to the\nCompany\u2019s performance. The Company\u2019s business\nrelies on the secure collection, transmission,\nstorage, use, retrieval, and other processing\nof confidential, proprietary, and other\nsensitive information in the Company\u2019s\ninformation systems, networks and those of\nthird parties. In addition, to access the\nCompany\u2019s systems, networks, products, and\nservices, the Company\u2019s clients and other\nthird parties may use personal mobile devices\nor computing devices that are outside of the\nCompany\u2019s control and network environments.\nThe Company\u2019s operating systems and\ninfrastructure are vulnerable to damage or\ninterruption from, among other things,\nsoftware bugs, server malfunctions, software\nor hardware failure, and human error. These\nrisks may increase in the future as Truist\ncontinues to evolve its internal and external\noperating systems and infrastructure.\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure\nexists throughout the Company\u2019s business, and\nbecause of the Company\u2019s interactions with and\nreliance on third parties, is not limited to\nthe Company\u2019s own internal operational\nfunctions. Truist\u2019s vendors, service\nproviders, and other third parties may expose\nthe Company to risk as a result of human\nerror, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure\nor breach of systems, networks, and\ninfrastructure. In addition, third-party\nsystem breakdowns or failures, could affect\ntheir ability to deliver a product or service\nto the Company or result in lost or\ncompromised information of the Company or its\nclients. Truist cannot be certain that it will\nreceive timely notification of such incidents\nor be able to exert any meaningful control or\ninfluence over how and when they are\naddressed. The Company\u2019s ability to conduct\nbusiness may be adversely affected by any such\nsignificant disruptions to third parties with\nwhom the Company interacts or relies upon.\n\nIn addition, as a result of increasing\nconsolidation, interdependence, and complexity\nof financial entities and technology systems\nand networks, a technology failure that\nsignificantly degrades, deletes, or\ncompromises the systems, networks, or data of\none or more financial entities could have an\nadverse impact on counterparties or other\nmarket participants. This consolidation,\ninterconnectivity, and complexity increases\nthe risk of operational failure, on both\nindividual and industry-wide bases, as\ndisparate systems need to be integrated, often\non an accelerated basis. Any third-party\ntechnology failure, other information or\nsecurity breach, termination, or constraint\ncould, among other things, adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s ability to conduct transactions,\nservice the Company\u2019s clients, manage the\nCompany\u2019s exposure to risk, or expand the\nCompany\u2019s business.\n\nTruist is heavily reliant on technology, and a\nfailure to effectively anticipate, develop,\nand implement new technology could negatively\nimpact our financial results, business,\noperations, or security.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing\nrapid technological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services, including those related\nto AI and migration to the cloud. Truist has\ninvested in technology to automate functions\npreviously performed manually, to facilitate\nthe ability of clients to engage in financial\ntransactions and otherwise to enhance the\nclient experience with respect to the\nCompany\u2019s products and services.\n\nTruist expects to make additional investments\nin innovation and technology to address\ntechnological disruption in the industry and\nimprove client offerings and service. Although\nchanges are designed to allow the Company to\nbetter serve the Company\u2019s clients and to\nreduce costs, many of these initiatives take a\nsignificant amount of time to develop and\nimplement, are tied to critical systems, and\nrequire substantial financial, human, and\nother resources. Although we take steps to\nmitigate the risks and uncertainties\nassociated with these initiatives, they are\nnot always implemented, and may not in the\nfuture be implemented, on time, within budget,\nor without negative financial, operational, or\nclient impact. In addition, these initiatives\ndo not always perform, and may not in the\nfuture perform, as we or our clients expect.\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in\npart, upon the Company\u2019s ability to address\nclients\u2019 needs by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that satisfy client\ndemands, including demands for faster,\nsimpler, and more secure payment services, to\ncreate efficiencies in the Company\u2019s\noperations, and to integrate those offerings\nwith legacy platforms or to update those\nlegacy platforms. A failure to maintain or\nenhance the Company\u2019s competitive position\nwith respect to technology, whether because of\na failure to anticipate client expectations or\nkeep pace with new or enhanced product or\nservice offerings by competitors, a failure in\nthe performance of technological developments,\nor an untimely roll out of developments, may\ncause the Company to lose market share or\nincur additional expense.\n\nOur use of systems and other technologies also\ndepends on rights or interests in the\nunderlying intellectual property, which we or\nour service providers may own or license. If\nwe or a service provider were alleged or found\nto be infringing on the intellectual-property\nrights of another person or entity, we could\nbe liable for significant damages for past\ninfringement, substantial fees for continued\nuse, and deprivation of access to or use of\nsuch intellectual property for limited or\nextended periods of time without the practical\navailability of an alternative, or we could\nenter into a settlement agreement to resolve\nsuch claims. For example, in 2023 we settled a\nlawsuit brought by another financial\ninstitution alleging that our mobile remote\ndeposit capture systems infringed patents\nowned by the other financial institution.\n\nThe Company faces risks associated with the\nquality, availability, and retention of key\ndata for operational, strategic, regulatory,\nand compliance purposes.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial and regulatory\nreporting, public disclosures, and key\nbusiness decisions are reliant on the quality,\navailability, and retention of data, including\npersonal information. A control failure, for\nexample, may lead to data breaches, data loss,\ndata misuse, and data integrity and quality\nrisks. These failures may result in\ninaccuracies in financial and regulatory\nreports, inhibited management decision-making,\nfinancial loss, reputational risk, and\nregulatory compliance risk, including data\nprivacy, data protection, and cybersecurity\ncompliance risks. We also can experience\nenforcement and other supervisory actions,\ndamage to our reputation, and private\nlitigation as a result of these failures.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\nThe Company and its suppliers and service\nproviders face a wide array of cybersecurity\nrisks, which could result in the loss,\nalteration, or disclosure of confidential,\nproprietary, personal, and other sensitive\ninformation; adversely impact the Company\u2019s\noperations, financial condition, prospects,\nand reputation; and cause significant legal\nand financial exposure.\n\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network\ninfrastructure and those of its suppliers and\nservice providers are continuously targeted in\ncyberattacks and vulnerable to damage or\ninterruption from, among other things, fraud,\ndenial of service attacks, social engineering\nschemes (such as phishing), hacking, malware\nor ransomware intrusion, data corruption\nattempts, terrorist activities, or identity\ntheft. Such incidents have exposed and may\ncontinue to expose security vulnerabilities in\nthe Company\u2019s systems, networks, or other\nsecurity measures, or those of third parties,\nand have resulted and could result in the\nunauthorized access, gathering, monitoring,\nmisuse, release, loss, or destruction of\nconfidential, proprietary, or other sensitive\ninformation, including personal information.\nSuch incidents could also damage the Company\u2019s\nsystems and networks by introducing material\ndisruptions to the network access or business\noperations of the Company, its clients, or\nother third parties.\n\nIn addition, Truist\u2019s clients, regulators, and\nother third parties, including other financial\nservices institutions and companies engaged in\ndata processing, have been subject to and will\ncontinue to be the target of cyberattacks and\nother similar incidents. The Company also\nfaces cybersecurity risks relating to partners\nand other third parties that the Company\nrelies upon to facilitate or enable business\nactivities, including vendors, service\nproviders, and providers of critical\ninfrastructure such as internet access and\nelectrical power. While the Company performs\ncybersecurity due diligence on its vendors and\nservice providers, the Company does not\ncontrol its vendors or service providers and\nits ability to monitor their cybersecurity is\nlimited. Therefore, the Company cannot ensure\nthat the cybersecurity measures they take will\nbe sufficient to protect information the\nCompany shares with them or prevent disruption\narising from a cyberattack. In addition, the\nexistence of cyberattacks or security breaches\nat third-party vendors and service providers\nwith access to the Company\u2019s data and systems\nmay not be disclosed to the Company in a\ntimely manner.\n\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions\nhave significantly increased in recent years\nand will likely continue to increase, in part\nbecause of the proliferation of new\ntechnologies to facilitate and conduct\nfinancial transactions. In addition,\ncybersecurity risks have significantly\nincreased in recent years in part due to the\nincreased sophistication and activities of\norganized crime affiliates, terrorist\norganizations, hostile foreign governments,\nstate-sponsored actors, disgruntled teammates\nor vendors, hackers, activists, and other\nexternal parties, including those involved in\ncorporate espionage, any of which may see\ntheir effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI,\nincluding the use of generative AI to conduct\nmore sophisticated social engineering attacks\non the Company or its clients. Even the most\nadvanced internal control environment may be\nvulnerable to compromise. Persistent attackers\nmay succeed in penetrating defenses given\nenough resources, time, and motive. The\ntechniques used by cybersecurity threat actors\nchange frequently and may not be recognized\nuntil launched or well after a breach has\noccurred.\n\nA successful penetration or circumvention of\nsystem or network security could cause serious\nnegative consequences, including loss of\nclients and business opportunities; costs\nassociated with maintaining business\nrelationships after a cyberattack or security\nbreach; significant disruption to the\nCompany\u2019s operations and business;\nmisappropriation, exposure or destruction of\nthe Company\u2019s confidential, proprietary, and\nother sensitive information, including\npersonal information, and funds and those of\nthe Company\u2019s clients; damage to the Company\u2019s\nor the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or third parties\u2019\ncomputers, systems, or networks; and a\nviolation of applicable laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to data privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity. This could\nresult in litigation exposure, regulatory\nfines, penalties, loss of confidence in the\nCompany\u2019s security measures, reputational\ndamage, reimbursement or other compensatory\ncosts, and additional compliance costs, which\ncould adversely impact the Company\u2019s results\nof operations, liquidity, and financial\ncondition. In addition, we may not have\nadequate insurance coverage to compensate for\nlosses from any of the foregoing, our existing\ninsurance coverage may not continue to be\navailable on acceptable terms or at all, and\nour insurers may deny coverage as to any\nfuture claims.\n\nIn addition, cybersecurity and data-privacy\nrisks have received heightened legislative,\nregulatory, and supervisory attention.\nLegislation and regulations on cybersecurity\nand data privacy, as well as related\nsupervisory expectations, can compel us to\nenhance or modify our systems and\ninfrastructure, invest in new systems and\ninfrastructure, change our service providers,\naugment our scenario and vulnerability\ntesting, and alter our business practices or\nour policies on security, data governance, and\nprivacy. Any of these, in turn, can cause a\nsignificant increase in the complexity and\ncosts of our operations and expose us to\nenforcement and other supervisory actions,\nrelated litigation by private plaintiffs,\nreputational damage, and a loss of client or\ninvestor confidence.\n\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Other External Risks                        \n                                              \nPhysical, transition, and other risks\nassociated with climate change, together with\ngovernmental responses to them, may negatively\nimpact our business, operations, reputation,\nand clients.\n\nClimate change presents physical risks from\nthe direct impacts of changing climate\npatterns and acute weather events, such as\ndamage to physical assets and service\ndisruptions, and transition risks from changes\nin regulations, disruptive technologies, and\nshifting market dynamics towards a lower\ncarbon economy. The physical risks of climate\nchange include discrete events, such as\nflooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, and\nwildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate\npatterns, such as extreme heat, sea level\nrise, and more frequent and prolonged drought.\nPhysical risks may alter the Company\u2019s\nstrategic direction in order to mitigate\ncertain financial risks. Such events could\nalso disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or those\nof its clients or third parties the Company\nrelies on, not only through direct damage to\nassets, but also from indirect impacts due to\nsupply chain disruption and market volatility.\nPhysical risks ultimately could result in\ndeclines in asset values (which could be\nexacerbated by specific portfolio or\ngeographic concentrations), reduced\navailability and therefore increased costs of\ninsurance for our clients and third parties,\ninterruptions of supply chains and business\noperations, and population migration or\ndepressed economies and increased unemployment\nin affected regions, any or all of which could\nresult in increased credit risk to Truist or\nhave other negative impacts.\n\nTransition risks, including changes in\nconsumer preferences, longer-term shifts in\nmarket dynamics, additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes, and additional\ncounterparty or client requirements, could\nhave an adverse impact on asset values and the\nfinancial performance of Truist\u2019s businesses,\nand those of its clients, and could be\nexacerbated in specific industries that may be\nmore sensitive or vulnerable to a transition\nto a low carbon economy. Climate change could\nalso present incremental risks to the\nexecution of the Company\u2019s long-term strategy.\nWhile material impact from climate change is\nexpected to occur over a longer time horizon,\nthe acceleration of a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy could present idiosyncratic\nrisks for individual companies. Additionally,\ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy will\nentail extensive policy, legal, technology,\nand market initiatives. Transition risks could\nresult in the sudden devaluation of assets,\nincreased costs for energy and operations, and\ntherefore could have unforeseen and negative\nconsequences on business models for us, our\nclients and other third parties.\n\nGovernments have been focused on the effects\nof climate change and environmental issues,\nand how they act to mitigate related risks\ncould have an adverse effect on our business\nand financial results. This focus could\nultimately result in legislation or\nregulations that could, among other things:\ndirectly or indirectly compel us to alter our\nbusinesses or operations in ways that would be\ndetrimental to our results of operations and\nprospects; negatively impact our capital\nplans; or cause us to incur additional\ncapital, compliance, and other costs.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces potential\nreputational risks as a result of its\npractices related to climate change, including\nas a result of the Company\u2019s direct or\nindirect involvement, or lack of involvement,\nin certain industries, as well as any\ndecisions management makes in response to\nmanaging climate risk, especially as views on\nclimate-related matters become subject to\nincreased polarization. Further, there is\nincreased scrutiny of climate change-related\npolicies, goals, and disclosures, which could\nresult in litigation and regulatory\ninvestigations and actions or reputational\ndamage. We may incur additional costs and\nrequire additional resources as we evolve our\nstrategy, practices, and related disclosures\nwith respect to these matters.\n\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses\nfrom fraud.\n\nIncreased and evolving activity perpetrated by\nbad actors intending to defraud,\nmisappropriate property, or circumvent the law\nusing different channels, products. and means\nmay outpace and outmaneuver the Truist control\nenvironment and monitoring activities\nimpacting clients, teammates, and\nstakeholders. Fraud attacks in the banking\nsector have surged in recent years, driven by\nincreasingly sophisticated and rapid\ntechniques. Many bad actors, often linked to\nlarge criminal organizations, share strategies\nto execute schemes, such as debit and credit\ncard fraud, peer-to-peer payment fraud,\ncounterfeit checks, social engineering, ATM\nskimming, and phishing, and recent advances in\nartificial intelligence may make it more\ndifficult to detect fraud. Fraudulent schemes\nexploit products like real-time payments, ACH,\nand wire transfers to steal funds. Fraudsters\nimpersonate legitimate clients using stolen\nidentities, employ other individuals to\ninteract with Truist, or create fraudulent\nidentities. In some cases, fraud is even\ncommitted by existing clients. A failure to\ndetect, prevent, and address fraud could\nresult in financial loss to the Company or its\nclients, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s\nsecurity measures, client dissatisfaction,\nlitigation exposure, regulatory\ninvestigations, fines, penalties or\nintervention, reimbursement, or other\ncompensatory costs (including the costs of\ncredit monitoring services), additional\ncompliance costs, and harm to the Company\u2019s\nreputation, all of which could adversely\naffect the Company.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 29\nNatural disasters, pandemics, and other\ncatastrophic events could adversely impact us.\n\nThe occurrence of, or increased severity and\nfrequency of, natural disasters, extreme\nweather events, health crises, disease\noutbreaks or pandemics, or other catastrophic\nevents, as well as government actions or other\nrestrictions in connection with such events,\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or results of operations. Truist has\nsignificant operations and clients along the\nGulf and Atlantic coasts as well as other\nregions of the U.S., which could be adversely\nimpacted by hurricanes, wildfires, flooding,\ntornadoes, and other severe weather in those\nareas. Rising insurance costs as well as\ndecreasing insurance provider options\nresulting from natural disasters, extreme\nweather events, and other catastrophic events\ncould cause supply chain issues, population\nmigration, or the weakening of economic\nconditions in certain regions. In addition,\nnatural and other types of disasters,\nincluding as a result of climate change, could\ndisrupt the Company\u2019s operations or the\nability or willingness of the Company\u2019s\nclients to access the financial services\noffered by Truist, and could adversely impact\nCompany borrowers\u2019 ability to timely repay\ntheir loans and the value of any collateral\nheld. These events could reduce the Company\u2019s\nearnings and cause volatility in the Company\u2019s\nfinancial results for any fiscal quarter or\nyear and have an adverse effect on the\nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. Although Truist has\nbusiness continuity plans and other safeguards\nin place, there can be no assurance that such\nbusiness continuity plans will be effective.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risks                            \n                                              \nTruist is subject to extensive and evolving\ngovernment regulation and supervision, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and\nprospects.\n\nThe banking and financial services industries\nare highly regulated. Truist is subject to\nsupervision, regulation, and examination by\nregulators, including the FRB, FDIC, NCCOB,\nSEC, CFTC, CFPB, FINRA, MSRB, NFA, and various\nother federal and state regulatory agencies.\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework\napplicable to banking organizations is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and other customers, the DIF, the\nbroader economy, and the stability of the U.S.\nfinancial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and non-deposit\ncreditors. In addition to banking statutes,\nregulations, and other laws, Truist is subject\nto various other laws that directly or\nindirectly affect its business and operations,\nincluding its ability to make distributions to\nshareholders. Governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations also issue policy\nstatements, interpretive letters, guidance,\nand other documents and communications that\nsimilarly impact Truist. The scope,\ncomplexity, intensity, and interpretation of\nthese laws, documents, communications, and\nactions can vary based on such factors as the\nstate of the economy, the prevailing political\nenvironment, and the performance of business\nand operations by us and other financial\ninstitutions.\n\nTruist is also subject to heightened\nrequirements under the enhanced prudential\nstandards and increased supervisory scrutiny,\nincluding, for example, single counterparty\ncredit limits, heightened expectations with\nrespect to governance, risk management and\ninternal controls, and additional capital and\nliquidity requirements.\n\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide\nvariety of laws, rules, and regulations\nvarying across Truist\u2019s lines of business,\ncorporate functions, and jurisdictions, and\ninclude risks related to financial products\nand services, relationships and interactions\nwith clients, and teammate activities.\nCompliance risks include those associated with\nanti-money laundering compliance, trading\nactivities, market conduct, and the laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the offering\nof financial products and services. Compliance\nrisk is also inherent in Truist\u2019s fiduciary\nactivities, including the failure to exercise\nthe applicable standard of care to act in the\nbest interest of fiduciary clients or to treat\nfiduciary clients fairly.\n\nThe regulation and supervision of Truist\nsignificantly affects the way that we conduct\nour business and operations. Laws and\nregulations that are applicable to us, and\nTruist\u2019s inability to act in certain instances\nwithout receiving prior regulatory approval,\naffect Truist\u2019s lending practices, capital\nstructure, investment practices, dividend\npolicy, ability to repurchase common stock,\nand ability to pursue strategic acquisitions,\namong other activities. Changes to statutes,\nregulations, or regulatory policies or their\ninterpretation or implementation and the\ncontinued heightening of regulatory\nrequirements could affect Truist in\nsubstantial and unpredictable ways. Federal\nand state banking regulators also possess\nbroad powers to take supervisory actions as\nthey deem appropriate. These supervisory\nactions may result in higher capital and\nliquidity requirements, higher deposit\ninsurance premiums, higher compliance\nexpenses, changes to our business or\noperations, and monetary penalties. These\nactions could also negatively impact the\nproducts and services that we offer and our\nability to engage in business opportunities.\nThe restrictions imposed by any of these\nactions could have an adverse effect on our\noperations, strategy, profitability, and\nreputation.\n\nTruist has elected to be treated as an FHC,\nwhich permits us to engage in a number of\nfinancial and related activities beyond\nbanking, including securities, advisory, and\nmerchant banking activities. Truist and Truist\nBank are subject to ongoing requirements for\nTruist to qualify as an FHC. If a BHC or any\nof its insured depository institutions were\nfound not to be well capitalized or well\nmanaged, as defined under applicable law, the\nBHC can be restricted from engaging in the\nbroader range of financial and related\nactivities permitted for FHCs, including the\nability to acquire companies engaged in those\nactivities, and can be required to discontinue\nthese activities or even divest any of its\ninsured depository institutions. In addition,\nif an insured-depository-institution\nsubsidiary of a BHC were to fail to achieve a\nsatisfactory or better rating under the CRA,\nthe ability of the BHC to expand its financial\nand related activities or make acquisitions\ncould be restricted.\n\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nFinancial regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad power\nand discretion to direct Truist\u2019s actions, and\nthey have assumed an active oversight,\nexamination, and enforcement role across the\nfinancial services industry on both the\nfederal and state levels. Areas of focus in\nthe recent past have been with respect to\nclimate change, deposits, interest-rate risk\nmanagement, commercial real estate, risk\ngovernance and controls, capital, liquidity,\nlong-term debt requirements, consumer loan\npractices, data privacy, data protection,\ncybersecurity, overdraft and other fees,\nretention and recordkeeping of electronic\ncommunications, reimbursement for fraudulent\ntransactions, and other compliance matters.\n\nTruist must comply with laws and regulations\nrelating to AML, economic sanctions, embargo\nprograms, and anti-corruption, which can\nincrease its risks of non-compliance and costs\nassociated with the implementation and\nmaintenance of complex compliance programs.\nThese laws and regulations are designed to\nprotect the financial system, consumers, and\nfinancial institutions from bad actors and\nillicit activities by requiring financial\ninstitutions to develop and implement programs\ndesigned to deter and when possible detect and\nprevent the use of the financial system to\nfacilitate the funding of criminal activities.\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal financial institution\nregulators, OFAC, and the U.S. DOJ, among\nother government agencies, with respect to\nthese laws and regulations. This enforcement\nauthority includes, among other things, the\nability to: assess significant civil or\ncriminal monetary penalties, fines, or\nrestitution; issue cease and desist or\nprohibition orders; and initiate injunctive\nactions against financial institutions and\ninstitution-affiliated parties, including\nindividual teammates. These enforcement\nactions may be initiated for violations of\nlaws and regulations or unsafe and unsound\npractices. Additionally, actual or alleged\nmisconduct by teammates, including unethical,\nfraudulent, improper, or illegal conduct, or\nunfair, deceptive, abusive, or discriminatory\npractices, can result in litigation, or\ngovernment investigations and enforcement\nactions, and cause significant reputational\nharm to Truist, even if allegations are\nultimately unsubstantiated.\n\nThe Company and other large financial\ninstitutions have become subject to increased\nscrutiny, more intense supervision and\nregulation, and more supervisory findings and\nactions, with increased operational and\ncompliance costs, as well as impacts on\ngeographic expansion and acquisitions, which\nmay continue. The financial services industry\nhas faced and may continue to face a stricter\nand more aggressive enforcement of laws at\nfederal, state, and local levels\u2014particularly\nin connection with business and other\npractices that may harm or appear to harm\nconsumers or affect the financial system more\nbroadly. Truist expects to remain subject to\nextensive regulation and supervision. Any\npotential new regulations or modifications to\nexisting regulations would likely necessitate\nchanges to Truist\u2019s existing regulatory\ncompliance and risk management infrastructure\nand could result in increased compliance\ncosts.\n\nOur regulatory and supervisory environments,\nwhether at federal, state, or local levels,\nare not static. No assurance can be given that\napplicable statutes, regulations, and other\nlaws will not be amended or construed\ndifferently, that new laws will not be\nadopted, or that any of these laws will not be\nenforced more aggressively, including as a\nresult of changes to control of branches of\nthe U.S. government. Truist could become\nsubject to future legislation and regulatory\nrequirements beyond those currently proposed,\nadopted, or contemplated in the U.S. or\nabroad, including limits on acquisitions, more\nstringent capital and liquidity requirements,\npolicies and rulemaking related to emerging\ntechnologies, cybersecurity, and data, and\nclimate risk management, governance, and\nreporting, including emissions and\nsustainability disclosure. In addition,\nconcerns over climate change may prompt\nchanges in regulations that, in turn, could\nhave an adverse impact on asset values and the\nfinancial performance of Truist\u2019s businesses\nand its clients. The cumulative effect of such\nlegislation and regulations on Truist\u2019s\nbusiness, operations, and profitability cannot\nbe accurately predicted. Such regulatory\nchanges may reduce Truist\u2019s revenues, limit\nthe types of financial services and products\nit may offer, alter the investments it makes,\naffect the manner in which it operates its\nbusinesses, increase its litigation and\nregulatory costs, and increase the ability of\nnonbanks to offer competing financial services\nand products. Further, our noncompliance with\napplicable laws, whether as a result of\nchanges in interpretation or enforcement,\nsystem or human errors, or otherwise and, in\nsome cases, regardless of whether\nnoncompliance was inadvertent, can result in\nthe suspension or revocation of authority to\nconduct business operations and in the\ninitiation of supervisory actions, enforcement\nproceedings, or private litigation.\n\nTruist also relies upon third parties who may\nexpose the Company to compliance and legal\nrisk. New or existing legal requirements also\ncould heighten the reputational impact of\nperceived misuses of client data by the\nCompany and third parties. See additional\ndisclosures in the \u201cRegulatory Considerations\u201d\nsection in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity standards and\nfuture revisions to them may negatively impact\nour business and financial results.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements established by the FRB\nand the FDIC. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the BCBS and then\napplied, with adjustments, in each country by\nthe appropriate domestic regulatory bodies.\nDomestic regulatory agencies have the ability\nto apply stricter capital and liquidity\nstandards than those developed by the BCBS. In\nseveral instances, the U.S. banking agencies\nhave done so with respect to U.S. banking\norganizations.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of the\nCompany\u2019s capital and liquidity may prevent\nthe Company from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force the Company to take\nactions contrary to their interests. For\nexample, Truist may be limited in its ability\nto pay or increase dividends or otherwise\nreturn capital to shareholders. In addition,\nthese requirements may impact the amount and\ntype of loans the Company is able to make.\nTruist may be constrained in its ability to\nexpand, either organically or through mergers\nand acquisitions. These requirements may cause\nthe Company to sell or refrain from acquiring\nassets where the capital requirements appear\ninconsistent with the assets\u2019 underlying\nrisks. In addition, liquidity standards\nrequire the Company to maintain holdings of\nhighly liquid investments, thereby reducing\nthe Company\u2019s ability to invest in less liquid\nassets, even if more desirable from a balance\nsheet return or interest rate risk management\nperspective. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to additional\ncapital and liquidity requirements. For\nexample, Truist is subject to a requirement to\nsubmit capital plans to the Federal Reserve\nfor review that include, among other things,\nprojected dividend payments and repurchases of\ncapital stock. As part of the capital planning\nand stress testing processes, our capital\nactions are assessed against our ability to\nsatisfy applicable capital requirements in the\nevent of a stressed market environment. If we\nfail to satisfy applicable capital\nrequirements, including the SCB, our ability\nto undertake capital actions may be\nrestricted.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements applicable to Truist\nand Truist Bank, the Company\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to capital\nrequirements established by the SEC.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nreceive periodic review and revision by the\nBCBS and the U.S. banking agencies. Proposed\nchanges to applicable capital and liquidity\nrequirements, such as the Basel III proposal\nand the long-term debt proposal, could result\nin increased expenses or cost of funding,\nwhich could negatively affect our financial\nresults or our ability to pay dividends and\nengage in share repurchases. For more\ninformation concerning our legal and\nregulatory obligations with respect to Basel\nIII and long-term debt requirements, please\nsee \u201cRegulatory Considerations\u201d in Item 1\n\u201cBusiness.\u201d\n\nTruist is subject to risks related to\noriginating and selling loans, including\nrepurchase and indemnification obligations.\n\nWhen loans are sold or securitized, it is\ncustomary to make representations and\nwarranties to the purchaser about the loans,\nincluding the manner in which they were\noriginated, and to agree to repurchase the\nloans or indemnify the buyer in the event of a\nbreach of the sale agreement, including a\nbreach of these representations or warranties.\nAn increase in the number of repurchase and\nindemnity demands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on sold loans\ncould result in an increase in the amount of\nlosses for loan repurchases. Truist also bears\na risk of loss from borrower defaults for\nmulti-family commercial mortgage loans sold to\nFNMA.\n\nIn addition to repurchase claims from GSEs,\nTruist could be subject to indemnification\nclaims from non-GSE purchasers of the\nCompany\u2019s loans. Claims could be made if the\nloans sold fail to conform to statements about\ntheir quality, the manner in which the loans\nwere originated and underwritten, or their\ncompliance with state and federal law.\n\nAdditional factors affecting the extent to\nwhich we may securitize loans and receivables\nin the future include the overall credit\nquality of our loans and receivables, the\ncosts of securitizing our loans and\nreceivables, the demand for consumer asset-\nbacked securities and the legal, regulatory,\naccounting or tax rules affecting\nsecuritization transactions and asset-backed\nsecurities, generally. In addition, proposals\nregarding reform to the U.S. housing finance\nmarket could impact our decisions regarding\nwhich loans should be securitized in the\nfuture.\n\nTruist faces risks as a servicer of loans.\n\nThe Company acts as servicer for a range of\nassets and products, primarily for loans in\nsecuritizations and unsecuritized loans owned\nby investors. As servicer for loans, the\nCompany has certain contractual obligations to\nthe securitization trusts, investors, or other\nthird parties, including foreclosing on\ndefaulted loans or, to the extent consistent\nwith the applicable securitization or other\ninvestor agreement, considering alternatives\nto foreclosure such as loan modifications or\nshort sales. Generally, the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations are set by contract, for\nwhich the Company receives a contractual fee.\nHowever, GSEs can amend their servicing\nguidelines unilaterally for certain government\nguaranteed mortgages, which can increase the\nscope or costs of the services required\nwithout any corresponding increase in the\nCompany\u2019s servicing fee. Federal and state\nlaws that impose additional servicing\nrequirements could increase the scope and cost\nof the Company\u2019s servicing obligations. As a\nservicer, the Company also advances expenses\non behalf of investors, which it may be unable\nto collect.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nA material breach of the Company\u2019s obligations\nas servicer may result in contract termination\nif the breach is not cured within a specified\nperiod of time following notice, causing the\nCompany to lose servicing income. In addition,\nthe Company may be required to indemnify the\nsecuritization trustee or other holder of the\nloan against losses from any failure by the\nCompany, as a servicer, to perform the\nCompany\u2019s servicing obligations or any act or\nomission on the Company\u2019s part that involves\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross\nnegligence. For certain investors and certain\ntransactions, Truist may be contractually\nobligated to repurchase a loan or reimburse\nthe investor for credit losses incurred on the\nloan as a remedy for servicing errors with\nrespect to the loan. The Company may be\nsubject to increased repurchase or indemnity\nobligations as a result of claims made that\nthe Company did not satisfy its obligations as\na servicer. The Company may also experience\nincreased loss severity on repurchases, which\nmay require a material increase to the\nCompany\u2019s repurchase reserve. While the number\nof such indemnification claims has been small,\nthese could increase in the future.\n\nTruist faces substantial risks in safeguarding\npersonal and other sensitive information.\n\nTruist\u2019s businesses are subject to complex and\nevolving laws, rules, and regulations\ngoverning data privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity, particularly with respect to\nthe privacy and protection of personal\ninformation of individuals. Individuals whose\npersonal information may be protected by law\ncan include the Company\u2019s clients (and in some\ncases its clients\u2019 clients), prospective\nclients, job applicants, teammates, and the\nemployees of the Company\u2019s vendors, and other\nthird parties. Complying with the laws, rules,\nand regulations applicable to the Company\u2019s\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage,\nand other processing of personal information\ncan increase operating costs, impact the\ndevelopment of new products or services, and\nreduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling\nor misuse of personal information by the\nCompany or a third-party affiliated with the\nCompany could expose the Company to litigation\nor regulatory fines, penalties, or other\nsanctions.\n\nAdditional risks could arise from the failure\nof the Company or third parties to provide\nadequate disclosure or transparency to the\nCompany\u2019s clients about the personal\ninformation collected from them and the use of\nsuch information; to receive, document, and\nhonor the privacy preferences expressed by the\nCompany\u2019s clients; to protect personal\ninformation from unauthorized disclosure; or\nto maintain training on data privacy, data\nprotection, or cybersecurity practices for all\nteammates or third parties who have access to\npersonal information. Concerns regarding the\neffectiveness of Truist\u2019s measures to\nsafeguard personal information, or even the\nperception that those measures are inadequate,\ncould cause Truist to lose existing or\npotential clients, and thereby reduce Truist\u2019s\nrevenues. Furthermore, any failure or\nperceived failure by the Company to comply\nwith applicable data privacy, data protection,\nor cybersecurity laws, rules, or regulations\nmay subject it to inquiries, examinations, and\ninvestigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant\nliabilities or regulatory fines, penalties, or\nother sanctions. Any of these could damage\nTruist\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely\naffect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents\ninvolving the inappropriate disclosure,\ncollection, use, sharing, storage, and other\nprocessing of personal information have led to\nexpanded governmental scrutiny of practices\nrelating to the safeguarding of personal\ninformation by companies. That scrutiny has in\nsome cases resulted in, and could in the\nfuture lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,\nrules, and regulations relating to the\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage,\nand other processing of personal information.\nTruist will likely be subject to new and\nevolving data privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations in\nthe U.S. and abroad, which could result in\nadditional costs of compliance, litigation,\nregulatory fines, and enforcement actions.\nThese types of laws, rules, and regulations\ncould prohibit or significantly restrict\nfinancial services firms such as Truist from\nsharing information among affiliates or with\nthird parties such as vendors, and thereby\nincrease compliance costs, or could restrict\nTruist\u2019s use of personal information when\ndeveloping or offering products or services to\nclients. These restrictions could also inhibit\nTruist\u2019s development or marketing of certain\nproducts or services or increase the costs of\noffering them to clients.\n\nFor more information concerning our legal and\nregulatory obligations with respect to data\nprivacy, data protection, and cybersecurity,\nplease see \u201cPrivacy, Data Protection, and\nCybersecurity\u201d in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\n\nDifferences in regulation and supervision can\naffect the Company\u2019s ability to compete\neffectively.\n\nThe content and application of laws and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as\nthe size of the firm, the jurisdiction in\nwhich it is organized or operates, and other\ncriteria. Large institutions, such as the\nCompany, often are subject to more stringent\nregulatory requirements and supervision than\nsmaller institutions. In addition, financial\ntechnology companies and other non-traditional\ncompetitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation or may be supervised by a national\nor state regulatory agency that does not have\nthe same regulatory priorities or supervisory\nrequirements as the Company\u2019s regulators.\nThese differences in regulation can impair the\nCompany\u2019s ability to compete effectively with\ncompetitors that are less regulated and do not\nhave similar compliance costs.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 33\n                                              \n  Regulatory and Legal Risks                  \n                                              \nThe Company may incur damages, fines,\npenalties, and other negative consequences\nfrom past, current, or future supervisory\nactions and regulatory or other legal\nviolations, including inadvertent or\nunintentional violations.\n\nTruist maintains systems and procedures\ndesigned to support its compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can\nbe no assurance that these will be effective.\nIn addition to fines and penalties, the\nCompany may suffer other negative consequences\nfrom supervisory actions and regulatory\nviolations, including restrictions on certain\nactivities and damage to the Company\u2019s\nreputation, which in turn might adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business and results of\noperations.\n\nFederal and state law grants substantial\nenforcement and supervisory powers to federal\nand state banking regulators and law\nenforcement agencies if the regulated entities\nfail to comply with applicable laws or to\nmaintain a risk and control environment that\nmeets the standards and expectations of the\nregulators. This enforcement and supervisory\nauthority includes, among other things, the\nability to assess significant civil or\ncriminal monetary penalties, fines, or\nrestitution; to issue cease and desist or\nremoval orders; to issue formal and informal\nenforcement orders; and to initiate injunctive\nactions against banking organizations and\ninstitution-affiliated parties. These\nenforcement and supervisory actions may be\ninitiated for violations of laws and\nregulations or unsafe and unsound practices.\nIn addition, governmental authorities have, at\ntimes, sought criminal penalties against\ncompanies in the financial services sector for\nviolations, and, at times, have required an\nadmission of wrongdoing, criminal pleas or\nother extraordinary terms from financial\ninstitutions in connection with resolving such\nmatters. Criminal convictions or criminal\npleas or admissions of wrongdoing in a\nsettlement with the government can lead to\ngreater exposure in civil litigation,\nreputational harm, and other significant\ncollateral consequences, such as restrictions\non engaging in new activities or acquisitions,\nloss of clients, restrictions on the ability\nto access the capital markets, and the\ninability to operate certain businesses or\noffer certain products for a period of time.\n\nThe Company could become subject to a\nsignificant regulatory investigation or\nsupervisory action and be unable to disclose\nspecific information concerning it to the\npublic if such a disclosure would violate the\nCompany\u2019s obligations under applicable rules\nand regulations to maintain the\nconfidentiality of confidential supervisory\ninformation. Regulatory investigations,\nexaminations or other initiatives by\ngovernmental authorities may subject the\nCompany to litigation, settlements, fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and may require\nthe Company to engage in remediation, provide\nrestitution to customers or to restructure its\noperations and activities or to cease offering\ncertain products or services. Any of these\npotential outcomes could harm the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial\ncondition, prospects or reputation or could\nresult in collateral or ancillary\nconsequences. In addition, our exposure to\nlegal and regulatory matters can be\nunpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed\nthe Company\u2019s accruals for those matters.\n\nPending or threatened legal proceedings and\nother matters may adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the\nCompany is subject to lawsuits, claims, and\nformal and informal enforcement activity,\nincluding regulatory investigations, either\ndirectly or indirectly through our ownership\ninterests in other entities. The volume of\nlegal proceedings against participants in the\nfinancial services industry, including the\nCompany, is substantial, and enforcement\nactions by regulatory authorities are becoming\nmore common in the current regulatory\nenvironment. Legal proceedings against\nfinancial services firms may increase\ndepending on factors such as market downturns,\nchanges in law, and increased regulatory\nscrutiny.\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny or the results\nof an investigation or examination may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. Those actions could\nresult in regulatory settlements or other\nenforcement actions against Truist.\nFurthermore, a single event involving a\npotential violation of law or regulation may\ngive rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings by multiple\nfederal and state agencies and officials. In\naddition, if one or more financial\ninstitutions are found to have violated a law\nor regulation relating to certain business\nactivities, this could lead to investigations\nby regulators or other governmental agencies\nof the same or similar activities by other\nfinancial institutions, including Truist, and\nlarge fines and remedial measures that may\nhave been imposed in resolving earlier\ninvestigations for the same or similar\nactivities at other financial institutions may\nbe used as the basis for future settlements.\n\nTruist can also be subject to lawsuits,\nclaims, and enforcement activity indirectly\nthrough its ownership of interests in other\nentities. These other entities can themselves\nbe subject to government regulation,\nsupervision, and examination, and their\nfailure to comply with applicable laws, rules,\nregulations, or regulatory requirements or\nexpectations could have negative consequences\nfor Truist, including a decrease in the value\nof Truist\u2019s investment in the other entity,\ndamage to Truist\u2019s reputation from being an\nowner or otherwise associated with the other\nentity, or a requirement for Truist and the\nother owners to contribute funds to pay for\njudgments, settlements, fines, or client\nredress arising from the lawsuits, claims, or\nenforcement activity. Failure by another\nentity in which Truist has an ownership stake\nto comply with applicable laws, rules,\nregulations, or regulatory requirements or\nexpectations could also lead to lawsuits,\nclaims, or enforcement activity directly\nagainst the owners of the other entity,\nincluding Truist.\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nClaims and legal actions, including class\naction lawsuits and enforcement proceedings,\ncould involve large monetary amounts,\nsignificant defense costs, and result in\nsettlements, judgments, or orders that include\npenalties, fines, injunctions, or other forms\nof relief that are adverse to the Company.\nResponding to inquiries, investigations,\nlawsuits, and other proceedings is time-\nconsuming and expensive and can divert senior\nmanagement attention from Truist\u2019s business.\n\nThe outcome of any such legal proceedings, as\nwell as the timing of any ultimate\nresolutions, may be difficult to predict or\nestimate. Actual legal and other costs arising\nfrom claims and legal actions may be greater\nthan the Company\u2019s accruals. Further, the\nCompany may not have accruals for all legal\nproceedings where we face a risk of\nsignificant loss. The ultimate resolution of a\npending legal proceeding or significant\nregulatory or government action against the\nCompany could adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition\nor cause significant reputational harm, which\nmay adversely impact the Company\u2019s business\nprospects. Further, the Company may be exposed\nto substantial uninsured liabilities, which\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s results\nof operations and financial condition. Refer\nto the Legal Proceedings and Other Matters\nsection in \u201cNote 16. Commitments and\nContingencies\u201d for additional information.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risks                             \n                                              \nIneffective execution of strategic initiatives\ncould adversely affect investor sentiment and\nour business and financial results.\n\nThere is no guarantee that our strategic\ninitiatives, including initiatives to drive\nfocused growth, achieve operational excellence\nand efficiency, and leverage modern and\nscalable technology, will be successful and\nimprove profitability or allow us to return\ncapital to shareholders. Our execution of\nstrategic initiatives may be impacted by\ninternal factors, such as maintaining a level\nof earnings appropriate to support growth\nobjectives, the ability to maintain dividends\nin various economic cycles, or the successful\ndelivery of innovation and technology\nstrategies. In addition, our execution of our\nstrategies may be impacted by our response to\nexternal factors, including geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive,\nand regulatory factors. To the extent we are\nimpeded or unable to execute effective\nstrategic initiatives, our prospects for\ngrowth, earnings, capital levels, and stock\nprice, as well as stakeholder confidence in\nTruist, could be adversely affected.\n\nCompetition may reduce Truist\u2019s client base or\ncause Truist to modify the pricing or other\nterms for products and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business and\nfinancial results.\n\nTruist operates in a highly competitive\nindustry that could become even more\ncompetitive with growth in areas such as\ndigital financial service providers and other\nnonbank platforms. Increased competition could\narise from technological advancements,\nlegislative and regulatory changes, as well as\ncompetition from other financial services\ncompanies, some of which may be subject to\nless extensive regulation than Truist. The\nCompany\u2019s success depends, in part, on the\nCompany\u2019s ability to adapt its offering of\nproducts and services to evolving industry\nstandards and client expectations. The\nwidespread adoption of new technologies has\nrequired and will continue to require\nsubstantial investments to modify existing\nproducts and services or to develop new\nproducts and services. In addition, there is\nincreasing pressure to provide products and\nservices at lower prices further reducing\ncontribution margins. The Company may not be\nsuccessful in introducing new products and\nservices in response to industry trends or\ndevelopments in technology or those new\nproducts may not achieve market acceptance.\n\nTruist also competes with nonbank companies\nand, in some cases, with companies other than\nthose traditionally considered financial\nsector participants. In particular, technology\ncompanies are increasingly focusing on the\nfinancial sector, either in partnership with\ncompetitor banking organizations or on their\nown. These companies generally are not subject\nto the same regulatory oversight as main\nstreet financial institutions and may\naccordingly realize certain cost strategies\nand offer products and services at more\nfavorable rates and with greater convenience\nto the client. This competition could result\nin the loss of clients and revenue in areas\nwhere fintechs are operating. As the pace of\ntechnology and change advance, continuous\ninnovation is expected to exert long-term\npressure on the financial services industry.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies by\ncompetitors, including internet banking\nservices, mobile applications, advanced ATM\nfunctionality, AI, and cryptocurrencies, could\nrequire the Company to make substantial\ninvestments to modify or adapt the Company\u2019s\nexisting products and services or even\nradically alter the way Truist conducts\nbusiness. These and other capital investments\nin the Company\u2019s business may not produce\nexpected growth in earnings anticipated at the\ntime of the expenditure.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\nAcquisitions, mergers, and divestitures\nintroduce a broad range of anticipated and\nunanticipated risks, including unforeseen or\nnegative consequences from supervisory or\nregulatory action that may limit Truist\u2019s\nability to pursue and complete them.\n\nWe may from time to time seek to acquire other\nfinancial-services companies or businesses.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and\nuncertainties, including inaccurate financial\nand operational assumptions, incomplete or\nfailed due diligence, lower than expected\nperformance, higher than expected costs,\ndifficulties related to integration, diversion\nof management\u2019s attention from other business\nactivities, adverse market or other reactions,\nchanges in relationships with clients or\ncounterparties, the potential loss of key\npersonnel, and the possibility of litigation\nand other disputes. An acquisition also could\nbe dilutive to our existing shareholders if we\nwere to issue common stock to fully or\npartially pay or fund the purchase price. We,\nmoreover, may not be successful in identifying\nappropriate acquisition candidates,\nintegrating acquired companies or businesses,\nor realizing expected value from acquisitions.\nThere is significant competition for valuable\nacquisition targets, and we may not be able to\nacquire other companies or businesses on\nattractive terms. No assurance can be given\nthat we will pursue future acquisitions, and\nour ability to grow and successfully compete\nmay be impaired if we choose not to pursue or\nare unable to successfully make acquisitions.\n\nThe Company must satisfy a number of\nmeaningful conditions before completing an\nacquisition of another bank or BHC, including\nfederal and state regulatory approvals. In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nor BHC acquisition, bank regulators will\nconsider, among other factors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on competition; financial\ncondition and future prospects, including\ncurrent and projected capital ratios and\nlevels; the competence, experience, and\nintegrity of management; the supervisory\nrelationship; record of compliance with laws\nand regulations; the convenience and needs of\nthe communities to be served, including the\nacquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance\nunder the CRA; the effectiveness of the\nacquiring institution in combating money\nlaundering activities; and public comments. In\naddition, U.S. regulators must take systemic\nrisk to the U.S. financial system into account\nwhen evaluating whether to approve a potential\nacquisition transaction involving a large\nfinancial institution like Truist. There is no\ncertainty as to when or if or on what terms\nand conditions, any required regulatory\napprovals will be granted for any potential\nacquisition. In specific cases, Truist may be\nrequired to divest certain operations,\nincluding branches, or take other actions as a\ncondition to receiving regulatory approval. An\ninability to satisfy other conditions\nnecessary to consummate an acquisition\ntransaction, such as third-party litigation, a\njudicial order blocking the transaction, or\nlack of shareholder approval, could also\nprevent the Company from completing an\nannounced acquisition.\n\nIn addition, we may decide to divest certain\nbusinesses or assets. Divestitures of\nbusinesses involve a number of risks,\nincluding significant costs and expenses, and\nany divestiture we undertake could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and cash flows.\nDivestitures may involve significant\nuncertainty and execution complexity, which\nmay cause us not to achieve our strategic\nobjectives, realize expected cost savings, or\nobtain other benefits from the divestiture.\nThe significant risks and uncertainties\ninvolved in divestitures may include:\n\n\u2022 the inability to sell such businesses or\nassets on satisfactory price and terms and in\na timely manner, including potentially long\nand costly sales processes and unsuccessful\nattempts by a buyer to receive required\nregulatory approvals, satisfy other conditions\nto closing, or obtain equity or debt financing\nin order to satisfy its payment obligations\nrelated to the transaction,\n\n\u2022 disruption to other parts of our business\nand distraction of management,\n\n\u2022 loss of key teammates or clients,\n\n\u2022 exposure to contingencies, including, among\nother things, those arising from\nrepresentations and warranties made to a buyer\nregarding the businesses being sold, or\n\n\u2022 ongoing obligations to support the\nbusinesses following such divestitures,\nincluding through transition services\narrangements, and other adverse financial\nimpacts.\n\nWhether such divestitures are completed or\nnot, their pendency could have a number of\nnegative effects on our current business,\nincluding potentially disrupting our regular\noperations and diverting the attention of our\nworkforce and management team. It could also\ndisrupt existing business relationships, make\nit harder to develop new business\nrelationships, or otherwise negatively impact\nthe way that we operate our business. In the\nevent of a termination of a divestiture\ntransaction before it is consummated, the\npayment of a termination fee may not fully\ncompensate us for our losses.\n\nTruist has businesses other than banking that\nare subject to a variety of risks.\n\nTruist is a diversified financial services\ncompany. This diversity subjects the Company\u2019s\nearnings to a broader variety of risks and\nuncertainties. Other businesses in addition to\nbanking that the Company operates include\ninvestment banking, securities underwriting\nand market making, loan syndications,\ninvestment management and advice, and retail\nand wholesale brokerage services offered\nthrough the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. These\nbusinesses entail significant market,\noperational, credit, compliance, technology,\nlegal, and other risks that could adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\n36 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Reputational Risks                          \n                                              \nNegative public opinion, whether real or\nperceived, or our failure to successfully\nmanage it could damage the Company\u2019s\nreputation and adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects.\n\nTruist\u2019s earnings, capital, and stock price\nare subject to risks associated with negative\npublic opinion. Negative public opinion could\nresult from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged\nconduct in any number of activities, including\nlending, sales, training, quality assurance,\nclient complaint resolution, and other\noperating practices, incentive compensation\ndesign and governance, corporate governance,\nacquisitions, a data breach of client or\nteammate information, or the failure of any\nproduct or service sold to meet clients\u2019\nexpectations or applicable regulatory\nrequirements. There can be no assurance that\nthe Company\u2019s processes and actions will meet\nregulatory or other stakeholders\u2019 standards or\nexpectations. Findings from self-identified or\nregulatory reviews require responsive actions,\nwhich may include increased investments in\ncompliance systems and teammates or the\npayment of fines, penalties, increased\nregulatory assessments, or client redress and\nmay increase legal or reputational risk\nexposures. In addition, the public perception\nthat a cyberattack on the Company\u2019s systems\nhas been successful, whether or not this\nperception is correct, may damage the\nCompany\u2019s reputation with clients and third\nparties with whom the Company does business.\nAny cybersecurity breaches, attacks, and other\nsimilar incidents, including the compromise of\npersonal information, could significantly harm\nTruist\u2019s reputation, which could adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s financial condition and\nresults of operation.\n\nNegative public opinion could also result from\nheightened and differing stakeholder\nexpectations regarding environmental and\nsocial considerations that may affect Truist\nand clients of Truist. The proliferation of\nsocial media may increase the likelihood that\nnegative public opinion from any of the real\nor perceived events discussed above could\nimpact our reputation and business. Negative\npublic opinion could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nclients and teammates and can result in\nlitigation and regulatory actions. Actual or\nalleged conduct by one of the Company\u2019s\nbusinesses can result in negative public\nopinion about the Company\u2019s other businesses.\nActual or alleged conduct by another financial\nservices company can result in negative public\nopinion about the financial services industry\nin general and, as a result, adversely affect\nTruist.\n\nOur efforts to identify, measure and monitor\nreputational risk and communicate, internally\nand externally, such risks to key\nstakeholders, may be ineffective, untimely, or\notherwise result in adverse effects on the\nCompany.\n                                              \n  Talent Management Risks                     \n                                              \nWe could be harmed by an inability to attract,\ndevelop, retain, and motivate qualified\nteammates while effectively managing\nrecruiting and compensation costs amid highly\ncompetitive and rapidly changing market\nconditions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, to a large\ndegree, upon the continued services of\nexecutive officers and other key teammates who\nhave extensive experience and expertise in the\nindustry, and the Company\u2019s ability to\nattract, develop, and retain high performing,\nand well-qualified teammates. The Company\nfaces significant competition in the\nrecruitment of highly motivated teammates who\ncan deliver Truist\u2019s purpose, mission, and\nvalues. Changes in teammate preferences for\nwork environments, in particular the desire of\nteammates to work remotely for many or all of\ntheir hours, may impact our ability to attract\nand retain qualified teammates. The Company\u2019s\nbusiness or its ability to execute its\nbusiness strategy and provide high quality\nservice may suffer: due to the loss of key or\nhighly-skilled teammates or a failure to\nsuccessfully transition key roles; if the\nCompany is unable to recruit, develop, or\nretain a sufficient number of qualified\nteammates; or if the costs of teammate\ncompensation or benefits increase\nsubstantially. The U.S. banking agencies have\njointly issued comprehensive guidance to\nsupport incentive compensation policies and\npractices that do not undermine the safety and\nsoundness of banking organizations by\nencouraging teammates to take imprudent risks.\nThis guidance significantly affects the\namount, form, and context of incentive\ncompensation that may be provided to teammates\nand could negatively affect Truist\u2019s ability\nto compete for talent relative to non-banking\ncompanies.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 37\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on its ability,\nand the ability of key external parties, to\nmaintain appropriately staffed workforces and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health,\nand safety of teammates.\n\nTruist\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products\nand services that meet the expectations of its\nclients, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on\nits ability to staff its operations\nappropriately and on the competence,\nintegrity, health, and safety of its\nteammates. Truist is similarly dependent on\nthe workforces of other parties on which its\noperations rely, including vendors and other\nservice providers. Truist\u2019s businesses could\nbe adversely affected by the ineffective\nimplementation of business decisions; any\nfailure to institute controls that\nappropriately address risks associated with\nbusiness activities, or to appropriately train\nteammates with respect to those risks and\ncontrols; or staffing shortages, particularly\nin tight labor markets. Changes in law or\nregulation in jurisdictions in which our\noperations are located that affect teammates\nmay also adversely affect our ability to hire,\ndevelop, and retain qualified teammates in\nthose jurisdictions. In addition, the\nCompany\u2019s business could be adversely impacted\nby a significant operational breakdown or\nfailure, theft, fraud, or other unlawful\nconduct, or other negative outcomes caused by\nhuman error or misconduct by a teammate of\nTruist or a teammate of another party on which\nTruist\u2019s operations depend. Truist\u2019s\noperations could also be impaired if the\nmeasures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to support the health and safety\nof its teammates are ineffective, or if any\nexternal party on which Truist relies fails to\ntake appropriate and effective actions to\nprotect the health and safety of its\nteammates.\n                                              \n  Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions  \n                                              \nOur business and operations make extensive use\nof models, and we could be adversely affected\nif our design, implementation, or use of\nmodels is flawed.\n\nTruist relies on models to measure risks,\nestimate certain financial values, and inform\ncertain business decisions. Models may be used\nin such processes as determining the pricing\nof various products, grading loans and\nextending credit, measuring interest rate and\nother market risks, predicting or estimating\nlosses, assessing capital adequacy and\ncalculating economic and regulatory capital\nlevels, as well as estimating the value of\nfinancial instruments and balance sheet items.\n\nPoorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly\nused models present the risk that certain\nTruist business decisions may be adversely\naffected by inappropriate model output. In\naddition, models based on historical data may\ndegrade over time due to limited historical\npatterns, extreme or unanticipated market\nmovements, or client behavior and liquidity,\nespecially during severe market downturns or\nstress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic\nevents). Also, information Truist provides to\nthe public or to its regulators based on\npoorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly\nused models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nCertain decisions that the regulators make,\nincluding those related to capital\ndistributions to Truist\u2019s shareholders, could\nbe adversely affected due to the perception of\ninsufficient model quality or incorrect model\nuse.\n\nWe use estimates and assumptions in\ndetermining the value or amount of many of our\nassets and liabilities, and our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects could be adversely affected if\nthese prove to be incorrect.\n\nAccounting policies and processes are\nfundamental to how the Company records and\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require the\nuse of estimates and assumptions that may\naffect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or\nliabilities and financial results. Several of\nthe Company\u2019s accounting policies are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective, and complex judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain\nand because it is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported under\ndifferent conditions or using different\nassumptions. If assumptions or estimates\nunderlying the Company\u2019s financial statements\nare incorrect or are adjusted periodically,\nthe Company may experience material losses.\n\nManagement has identified certain accounting\npolicies as being critical because they\nrequire management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the\nvaluations of assets, liabilities,\ncommitments, and contingencies. A variety of\nfactors could affect the realization of income\nand expense or the recognition of assets and\nliabilities in the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements. Truist has established policies\nand procedures that are intended to provide\nfor these critical accounting estimates and\njudgments to be well controlled and applied\nconsistently. In addition, the policies and\nprocedures are intended to establish a process\nfor changing methodologies in an appropriate\nmanner. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the\nCompany\u2019s judgments and the estimates\npertaining to these matters, the Company\ncannot guarantee that adjustments to\naccounting policies or restatement of prior\nperiod financial statements will not be\nrequired.\n\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC\nadopt new accounting standards or change\nexisting financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that govern the preparation of the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements. In addition,\naccounting standard setters and those who\ninterpret the accounting standards may change\nor even reverse their previous interpretations\nor positions on how these standards should be\napplied. Changes in financial accounting and\nreporting standards and changes in current\ninterpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol, can be hard to predict and could\nmaterially affect how the Company reports its\nfinancial results and condition. In some\ncases, the Company could be required to apply\na new or revised standard retroactively,\nresulting in the restatement of prior period\nfinancial statements.\n\n38 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nDepressed market values for the Company\u2019s\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company\u2019s goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is periodically tested for impairment\nby comparing the fair value of each reporting\nunit to its carrying amount. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. The fair value of a reporting unit\nis impacted by the reporting unit\u2019s expected\nfinancial performance and susceptibility to\nadverse economic, regulatory, and legislative\nchanges. Based on the Company\u2019s annual\nimpairment test of goodwill as of October 1,\n2023, the Company incurred a $6.1 billion non-\ncash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment\ncharge for the year ended December 31, 2023\nbased on the carrying values of certain\nreporting units being in excess of their\nrespective fair values. Future adverse changes\nin economic conditions or expected financial\nperformance, a sustained decrease in Truist\u2019s\nstock price, a decline in industry peer\nmultiples, an increase in the applicable\ndiscount rate, or a deterioration in a\nreporting unit\u2019s forecast may cause the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit to be below its\ncarrying amount, resulting in an additional\ngoodwill impairment charge. The estimated fair\nvalues of the individual reporting units are\nassessed for reasonableness by reviewing a\nvariety of indicators, including comparing\nthese estimated fair values to the Company\u2019s\nmarket capitalization over a reasonable period\nof time. While this comparison provides some\nrelative market information about the\nestimated fair value of the reporting units,\nit is not determinative and needs to be\nevaluated in the context of the current\neconomic environment. However, significant and\nsustained declines in the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization could be an indication of\npotential goodwill impairment. Refer to the\n\u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d section for\nadditional details related to the Company\u2019s\nintangible assets and goodwill.\n                                              \n  Operational Risks                           \n                                              \nTruist relies extensively on third parties to\nprovide key components of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness infrastructure, and their failure to\nperform to our standards or our failure to\nappropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships could adversely affect us.\n\nThird parties provide key components of the\nCompany\u2019s business infrastructure and while we\nhave implemented a supplier risk management\nprogram, we do not control third-party service\nproviders, their actions, or their businesses.\nNo assurance can be provided that third-party\nservice providers will perform to our\nstandards, adequately represent our brand,\ncomply with applicable law, appropriately\nmanage their own risks, including\ncybersecurity, remain financially or\noperationally viable, abide by their\ncontractual obligations, or continue to\nprovide us with the services that we require.\n\nOur use of third-party service providers\nexposes us to the risk that such third parties\nmay not comply with their servicing and other\ncontractual obligations and to the risk that\nwe may not satisfy applicable regulatory\nresponsibilities regarding the management and\noversight of third parties. We may need to\nincur substantial expenses to address risks or\nissues with a service provider, and if such\nrisks or issues cannot be acceptably resolved,\nwe may not be able to timely or effectively\nreplace the service provider due to\ncontractual restrictions, the unavailability\nof acceptable alternative providers, or other\nreasons. In addition, a failure to\nappropriately assess and manage our\nrelationships with third parties, especially\nthose involving significant banking functions,\nshared services, or other critical activities,\ncould adversely affect Truist by resulting in\npotential harm to clients, and any liability\nassociated with that harm; supervisory\nactions, regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions; lower revenues, and the opportunity\ncost from lost revenues; increased operational\ncosts; or harm to Truist\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company is not insured against all types\nof losses as a result of third-party-related\nfailures, and the insurance coverage that does\nexist may be inadequate to protect the Company\nfrom all losses resulting from system failures\nor other disruptions. Failures in the\nCompany\u2019s business infrastructure could\ninterrupt its operations or increase the costs\nof doing business.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework may\nfail to identify and manage the risks that we\nface.\n\nTruist has policies, processes, and procedures\nintended to identify, measure, monitor,\nreport, and analyze the types of risk to which\nthe Company is subject, including liquidity,\ncredit, market, operational, technology,\nreputational, strategic, and compliance risk,\namong others. Notwithstanding such risk\nmanagement framework, however, we cannot\nguarantee that we adequately or effectively\nidentify and manage the risks in our business\nand operations currently, or that we will\nadequately or effectively identify and manage\nsuch risks in the future. For example, some of\nthe Company\u2019s methods of identifying and\nmanaging risk are based upon the Company\u2019s use\nof observed historical market behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. These methods may not\naccurately predict future exposures, which\ncould be significantly greater than historical\nmeasures indicate. Moreover, as the risks that\nwe face continue to evolve, despite our\nongoing efforts to improve the design and\nimplementation of our risk-management\nframework, those efforts may not be adequate\nor effective. If the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework fails to identify and manage the\nrisks that we face, we could suffer unexpected\nlosses and our financial condition and results\nof operations could be materially and\nadversely affected.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 39\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist depends on the accuracy\nand completeness of information about clients\nand counterparties, and Truist could be\nnegatively impacted if the information is not\naccurate or complete.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist relies on the\ncompleteness and accuracy of representations\nmade by and information furnished by or on\nbehalf of clients and counterparties,\nincluding financial statements and other\nfinancial information. If the information\nprovided is not accurate or complete, the\nCompany\u2019s decisions about extending credit or\nentering into other transactions with clients\nor counterparties could be adversely affected,\nand the Company could suffer defaults, credit\nlosses, or other negative consequences as a\nresult.\n\nTruist can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks\nassociated with the introduction of or changes\nto products, services, and delivery platforms.\n\nWhen Truist launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services\n(including mobile connectivity, electronic\ntrading and cloud computing), acquires or\ninvests in a business or makes changes to an\nexisting product, service or delivery\nplatform, it may not fully appreciate or\nidentify new operational risks that may arise\nfrom those changes, or may fail to implement\nadequate controls to mitigate the risks\nassociated with those changes. Any significant\nfailure in this regard could diminish Truist\u2019s\nability to operate one or more of its\nbusinesses or result in potential liability to\nclients and counterparties, and result in\nincreased operating expenses. The Company\ncould also experience higher litigation costs,\nincluding regulatory fines, penalties and\nother sanctions, reputational damage,\nimpairment of Truist\u2019s liquidity, regulatory\nintervention, or weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could\nadversely affect Truist\u2019s businesses and\nresults of operations.\n\n40 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 1C.

Refer to the \u201cRisk Management\u201d\nsection of Part II, Item 7 for additional\ndiscussion.\nCybersecurity risk management and strategy\nLike other financial services firms, Truist\nfaces an increasingly complex and evolving\ncybersecurity threat environment. See Item 1A,\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d for information on risks from\ncybersecurity threats. We maintain a risk-\nbased cybersecurity framework that is part of\nour ERM Framework. It is implemented through\npeople, processes, and technology, whereby we\nassess, identify, and manage material risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats, and seek to adapt\nour risk mitigation activities accordingly.\nFoundationally, our cybersecurity framework is\nbased upon the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology for Improving Critical\nInfrastructure Cybersecurity and is also\ndesigned to incorporate elements from\nadditional industry standards, such as those\nof the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council, to better suit the\nCompany\u2019s cyber risk profile. In addition, our\ncybersecurity framework incorporates internal\nand third-party capabilities that drive the\ndevelopment and implementation of our data\nsecurity strategy, which is designed to reduce\ncybersecurity risk while enabling Truist\u2019s\ncorporate business objectives.\nProcesses for assessing, identifying, and\nmanaging material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats\nWe maintain an Information Security Program\nthat specifies how we execute our\ncybersecurity framework. The Information\nSecurity Program is designed to assess,\nidentify, and manage risks arising from the\ncybersecurity threats facing Truist.Truist\nmaintains cybersecurity and information\nsecurity policies, procedures, and\ntechnologies that are intended to protect our\nclients\u2019, teammates\u2019 and our own data against\nunauthorized disclosure, modification, and\nmisuse. These policies, procedures, and\ntechnologies cover a broad range of areas,\nincluding identification of internal and\nexternal threats, access control, data\nsecurity, protective controls, detection of\nmalicious or unauthorized activity, incident\nresponse, and recovery planning.\nFor example, to further mitigate the risks\npresented by an evolving cyber threat\nlandscape, Truist:\n\u2022 provides data protection guidance to\nclients;\n\u2022 promotes data protection awareness and\naccountability through mandatory teammate\ntraining; and\n\u2022 conducts scenario-driven test exercises\nsimulating impacts and consequences developed\nthrough analysis of real-world incidents as\nwell as known and anticipated cyber threats.\nThese exercises are designed to assess the\nviability of Truist\u2019s crisis response and\nmanagement programs and provide the basis for\nimprovement.\nIn addition, as a key part of the Company\u2019s\nInformation Security Program, Truist\nparticipates in the federally recognized\nFinancial Services Information Sharing and\nAnalysis Center, as well as other industry\norganizations and initiatives that promote\nindustry best practices, such as harmonized\ncybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and\nsecure consumer financial data sharing.\nOur Cyber Incident Response Team is\nresponsible for identifying, triaging, and\ncontaining cybersecurity threats and\nincidents, including, to the extent possible,\nthose experienced by third-party service\nproviders. Incidents with potential for higher\nimpacts are routed to an enterprise response\nfunction that coordinates the response\nactivities across impacted resource groups and\nbusiness stakeholders. Through this structure,\nTruist manages its cyber, business, and legal\nobligations, including escalation to executive\nmanagement and the Board, as appropriate,\nclient and regulatory notifications, and\nremediation activities.\nOur Information Security Program is also\ndesigned to help oversee, identify, and\nmitigate cybersecurity risks associated with\nour use of third-party service providers.\nFollowing an initial assessment of the level\nof enterprise risk potentially posed by use of\nthe third party, the service provider is then\nsubject to further risk-based assessments on\nits operational resilience and cybersecurity\npractices, including disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity plans that specify the\ntime frame to resume activities and recover\ndata. In its agreements with third-party\nservice providers, Truist requires service\nproviders to adhere to Truist\u2019s relevant\ncybersecurity and operational resilience\nstandards, subject to certain exceptions that\nare managed on a case-by-case basis.\nOur Information Security Program is assessed\nperiodically to test the effectiveness of key\ncontrols through cybersecurity maturity\nmeasurements, technology risk oversight,\ncompliance risk management testing and\nmonitoring, internal audit review, and\nregulatory oversight.\nIn addition, Truist maintains disaster\nrecovery plans that are reviewed, modified,\nand approved annually.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 41\nManagement\u2019s role in assessing and managing\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats\nTruist\u2019s Information Security Program is\noperated and maintained by management,\nincluding the CIO, interim CISO, and CRO.\nThese senior officers are responsible for\nassessing and managing Truist\u2019s cybersecurity\nrisks. Our Information Security Program also\nincludes processes for escalating and\nconsidering the materiality of incidents that\nimpact Truist, including escalation to\nexecutive management and the Board, which are\nperiodically tested through tabletop exercises\nto assess Truist\u2019s preparedness.Our\ncybersecurity framework strategy, which is\noverseen by the interim CISO, is informed by\nvarious risk and control assessments, control\ntesting, external assessments, threat\nintelligence, and public and private\ninformation sharing.\nIn addition, various management committees\nassess and manage Truist\u2019s cybersecurity\nrisks. These committees promote visibility and\nawareness of cybersecurity risks and drive\naction and escalation as needed. The primary\nmanagement committees involved in Truist\u2019s\nInformation Security Program are the\nEnterprise Technology Risk Committee and the\nTechnology Risk Oversight Committee, each of\nwhich is a sub-committee of the ERC. Truist\u2019s\ncybersecurity teams that implement the\nInformation Security Program and the risk\npartners who oversee the program leverage\nthese committees to report on and escalate\ncurrent or emerging cybersecurity risks or\nother changes in the business environment\nwhich could affect Truist\u2019s risk profile or\ncontrol environment.\nAs discussed in more detail in the \u201cRisk\nManagement\u201d section of Part II, Item 7, the\nERC is a cross-functional executive forum to\npromote awareness and dialogue on risk matters\nacross the enterprise, including cybersecurity\nrisks, oversee the execution of risk program\nrequirements and sound risk management\nactivities, and enact delegated decision-\nmaking authority and oversight routines from\nthe BRC. Our CRO and CIO are members of the\nERC. The interim CISO provides updates at\nevery ERC meeting on cybersecurity and\ninformation security risk.\nThe Enterprise Technology Risk Committee\nprovides business unit oversight of key\nmanagement activities, including the Company\u2019s\nInformation Security Program. The Technology\nRisk Oversight Committee provides oversight of\nkey risk management activities to identify,\nassess, monitor, mitigate, and report on\ntechnology (including core technology, data\nand cybersecurity) risk across the enterprise.\nThese sub-committees serve as governing forums\nfor monitoring and escalating significant\ncybersecurity as well as other technology risk\nmatters to the ERC.\nThe members of management that lead our\nInformation Security Program and strategy have\nextensive experience in technology,\ncybersecurity, and information security. Our\nCRO previously served as our interim CIO and\nhas more than 20 years of banking experience\nspanning a variety of roles in both the\ncommercial and consumer segments, including\ncredit risk, portfolio risk management, model\nmanagement, acquisition integrations,\ntechnology, and vertically integrated\noperations for revenue producing businesses,\nincluding leading operational services across\nTruist for deposits, payments, credit card,\ncapital markets, consumer and wholesale\nlending, fraud, and care centers across all\nproducts. Our CIO has over 25 years of\nexperience leading technology teams at\nfinancial institutions, including in the areas\nof application development, infrastructure,\ninformation technology strategy, risk\nmanagement, and information security.\nFollowing the departure of our CISO in\nNovember 2024, the CIO is serving as our\ninterim CISO while our search for a permanent\nCISO continues. The CIO\u2019s direct reports have\non average over 20 years of experience with\ntechnology management and information security\nat financial institutions, including in the\nareas of governance, operations, application\nand data protection, access management, and\nbusiness information security.\nBoard of Directors\u2019 oversight of risks from\ncybersecurity threats\nOur Board has primary responsibility for the\noversight of our enterprise risk management\nand exercises its oversight function in\nrespect of cybersecurity risk through the BRC.\nThe BRC is responsible for overseeing Truist\u2019s\nrisk management function, including approving\nand reviewing Truist\u2019s risk management\nframework and policies, and overseeing\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of such framework\nand policies.The oversight responsibility of\nour Board and the BRC is facilitated through\nmanagement-reporting processes designed to\nprovide visibility to the Board on\ncybersecurity matters.For example, members of\nthe BRC receive regular reports from our CRO\nand interim CISO related to information\ntechnology and cybersecurity risks to Truist.\nThe BRC meets periodically with risk\nmanagement advisors and discusses with\nexecutive management any cybersecurity\nrecommendations received. Management also\ndiscusses urgent cybersecurity developments\nwith the Chairs of the BRC and BTC between\nBoard and committee meetings, as appropriate.\nThe Board annually reviews and approves our\nInformation Security Program and Information\nSecurity Policy.Additionally, the BTC provides\noversight of Truist\u2019s technology strategy,\nincluding elements of it that involve\ncybersecurity.\nTruist provides ongoing development and\neducation to its directors with respect to\ncybersecurity, including presentations at\nBoard meetings on special topics, such as\nupdates on cybersecurity legislation and\nregulation.

Truist\u2019s ability to\ngenerate liquid assets for distribution is\ndependent on the ability of Truist Bank to pay\ndividends to the Parent Company. The payment\nof cash dividends is an integral part of\nproviding a competitive return on\nshareholders\u2019 investments and needs to be\nbalanced with maintaining sufficient capital\nto support future growth and meet regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nManagement\u2019s target common dividend payout\nratio (computed by dividing common stock\ndividends by net income available to common\nshareholders) is between 30% and 50% during\nnormal economic conditions. Truist paid $2.8\nbillion, $2.8 billion, and $2.7 billion in\ncommon stock dividends during 2024, 2023, and\n2022, respectively. Truist expects common\ndividend declarations, if made, to occur in\nJanuary, April, July, and October with payment\ndates on or about the first of March, June,\nSeptember, and December. A discussion of\ndividend restrictions is included in \u201cNote 17.\nRegulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\u201d and in the \u201cRegulatory\nConsiderations\u201d section.\n                                              \n  Share Repurchases                           \n                                              \nTruist has periodically repurchased shares of\nits own common stock and expects to\nperiodically repurchase shares in the future\nunder publicly announced repurchase plans. In\naccordance with North Carolina law,\nrepurchased shares cannot be held as treasury\nstock, but revert to the status of authorized\nand unissued shares upon repurchase and are\ntherefore available for future issuances.\nRepurchases may be effected through open\nmarket purchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions, trading plans established in\naccordance with SEC rules, or other means. The\nquantity, timing, price, and other terms of\nany repurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including Truist\u2019s capital and\nliquidity positions and related internal\nframeworks, accounting and regulatory\nconsiderations (including any restrictions\nthat may be imposed by the FRB and any changes\nto capital, liquidity, and other regulatory\nrequirements that may be proposed or adopted\nby the U.S. banking agencies), Truist\u2019s\nfinancial and operational performance,\nalternative uses of capital, the trading price\nof Truist\u2019s common stock, and general market\nconditions.

We\nadded new clients and deepened existing\nrelationships, invested in our core banking\nbusiness, made enhancements to our technology\nand risk infrastructure, and maintained our\ncredit and expense discipline.\n\nWe executed on several important strategic\ninitiatives, including the sale of TIH and the\nrepositioning of our balance sheet. On May 6,\n2024, we completed the divestiture of TIH.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information. Following the sale of\nTIH, Truist executed a strategic balance sheet\nrepositioning of a portion of its AFS\ninvestment securities portfolio by selling\nlower-yielding investment securities,\nresulting in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion\nin 2024, allowing Truist to reinvest a portion\nof the proceeds in higher yielding securities.\n\nThese actions increased our capital and\nfurther enhanced our ability to support the\ngrowth needs of clients, while also returning\ncapital to shareholders. We returned $3.8\nbillion of capital to our common shareholders\nthrough $2.8 billion of common stock dividends\nand $1.0 billion of common share repurchases\nduring 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we have\n$4.0 billion remaining under our $5.0 billion\ncommon share repurchase authorization through\nthe end of 2026.\n\nIn addition, Truist redeemed all outstanding\nshares of its perpetual preferred stock series\nL and the corresponding depositary shares\nrepresenting fractional interests in such\nseries for $750 million.\n\nIn July 2024, we successfully completed the\nsale of Sterling Capital Management LLC, an\nasset management business. Cash proceeds and\nthe gain recognized on the sale were not\nmaterial.\n\nClarke R. Starnes III retired from his\nposition as CRO and Vice Chair. Brad Bender, a\n20-year Truist veteran who previously served\nas Truist\u2019s Head of Enterprise Operational\nServices and interim Chief Information\nOfficer, succeeded Starnes as CRO.\n\nHugh S. \u201cBeau\u201d Cummins III, Vice Chair and\nChief Operating Officer of Truist, resigned\nfrom his position, effective January 13, 2025.\nFollowing Mr. Cummins\u2019 departure, management\nof the enterprise payments business\ntransitioned to Kristin Lesher, Senior\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Wholesale\nBanking Officer. Mr. Cummins\u2019 remaining\nresponsibilities, including leading teams\nresponsible for enterprise operational\nservices, enterprise corporate services, the\nstrategy, transformation, and performance\noffice, and the governance and controls\norganization, transitioned to Michael B.\nMaguire, Senior Executive Vice President and\nCFO.\n\nWe launched Truist Cares for Western North\nCarolina, a three-year, $725 million\ncommitment to support and sustain hurricane\nrecovery and resiliency through dedicated\ncapital to support rebuilding and resiliency,\nloans or investments in Community Development\nFinancial Institutions, philanthropic grants\nto local and national nonprofit organizations,\nand community service hours.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\n                                              \n  Key Areas of Focus                          \n                                              \nOur strategic direction is to build the top\nsuper regional bank that grows with our\nclients with care.

Excluding securities losses, TE\nrevenue was $20.1 billion, representing a\ndecrease of $101 million compared to 2023. Net\ninterest income on a TE basis was $14.3\nbillion, down $441 million, or 3.0%, from the\nprior year primarily as a result of having a\nsmaller more efficient balance sheet after the\nrepositioning improving NIM by five basis\npoints.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets decreased $21.6\nbillion, or 4.4%, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to declines in average total\nloans of $15.8 billion, or 4.9%, and average\nsecurities of $13.7 billion, or 10.0%,\npartially offset by an increase in other\nearning assets of $7.3 billion, or 25%. The\nchange in average securities was driven by\nmaturities and the balance sheet\nrepositioning. The change in other earning\nassets (increase in balances held at the\nFederal Reserve) was driven by the balance\nsheet repositioning.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $13.3 billion, or\n3.3%, average short-term borrowings were flat,\nand average long-term debt decreased $13.0\nbillion, or 26% as a result of the smaller\nmore efficient balance sheet.\n\nNIM was 3.03% for 2024, up five basis points\ncompared to the prior year.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.34% for 2024, up 22 basis\npoints, compared to the prior year primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates. The\nyield on the average securities portfolio was\n2.83% for 2024, up 60 basis points compared to\nthe prior year, reflecting the balance sheet\nrepositioning and reinvesting cash flows into\nhigher yielding securities.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was 2.02%\nfor 2024, up 42 basis points compared to the\nprior year. The average cost of short-term\nborrowings was 5.36% for 2024, up 11 basis\npoints compared to the prior year. The average\ncost of long-term debt was 4.94% for 2024, up\n48 basis points compared to the prior year.\nThe increases in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe repricing of lower cost funding sources.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.9\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2024\ncompared to $2.1 billion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The net charge-off ratio\nfor the current year of 0.59% was up 9 basis\npoints compared to the prior year.\n\n\u2022 The decrease in the current year provision\nexpense primarily reflects a lower allowance\nbuild.\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off ratio was up compared to\nthe prior year driven by higher net charge-\noffs in the CRE, other consumer, credit card,\nand indirect auto portfolios, partially offset\nby higher recoveries in the commercial and\nindustrial portfolio. Additionally, the prior\nyear included $98 million of charge-offs\nrelated to the sale of the student loan\nportfolio.\n\nNoninterest income was down $6.3 billion for\nthe year ended December 31, 2024 compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due\nto $6.7 billion of securities losses resulting\nfrom the balance sheet repositioning, lower\nlending related fees, operating lease income,\nand card and payment related fees, partially\noffset by higher investment banking and\ntrading income, wealth management income,\nservice charges on deposits, and other income.\nExcluding securities losses, noninterest\nincome was up $340 million, or 6.2%, compared\nto the prior year.\n\nNoninterest expense was down $6.7 billion, or\n36%, for the year ended December 31, 2024\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2023\nprimarily due to the 2023 goodwill impairment\nof $6.1 billion, lower regulatory charges due\nto the FDIC special assessment and related\nadjustments ($64 million in 2024 compared to\n$507 million in 2023), lower other expense,\nexcluding the charitable contribution to the\nTruist Foundation, lower amortization of\nintangibles, and operating lease depreciation,\npartially offset by a $150 million charitable\ncontribution to the Truist Foundation (other\nexpense) and higher professional fees and\noutside processing expense.

Net interest margin\nwas 3.03%, up five basis points compared to\nthe prior year.\n\n\u2022 Average earning assets decreased $21.6\nbillion, or 4.4%, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to declines in average total\nloans of $15.8 billion, or 4.9%, and average\nsecurities of $13.7 billion, or 10.0%,\npartially offset by an increase in other\nearning assets of $7.3 billion, or 25%. The\nchange in average securities was driven by\nmaturities and the balance sheet\nrepositioning. The change in other earning\nassets (increase in balances held at the\nFederal Reserve) was driven by the balance\nsheet repositioning.\n\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.34% for 2024, up 22 basis\npoints, compared to the prior year primarily\nreflecting higher market interest rates. The\nyield on the average securities portfolio was\n2.83% for 2024, up 60 basis points compared to\nthe prior year, reflecting the balance sheet\nrepositioning and reinvesting cash flows into\nhigher yielding securities.\n\n\u2022 Average deposits decreased $13.3 billion, or\n3.3%, average short-term borrowings were flat,\nand average long-term debt decreased $13.0\nbillion, or 26% due to decreased funding\nneeds.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was 2.02%\nfor 2024, up 42 basis points compared to the\nprior year. The average cost of short-term\nborrowings was 5.36% for 2024, up 11 basis\npoints compared to the prior year. The average\ncost of long-term debt was 4.94% for 2024, up\n48 basis points compared to the prior year.\nThe increases in rates on deposits and other\nfunding sources was largely attributable to\nthe repricing of lower cost funding sources.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n\n50 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Represents daily average balances.\nUnrealized gains and losses on available-for-\nsale securities are included in nonearning\nassets.

year ended December 31, 2024\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2023\nprimarily due to the 2023 goodwill impairment\nof $6.1 billion, lower regulatory charges due\nto the FDIC special assessment and related\nadjustments ($64 million in 2024 compared to\n$507 million in 2023), lower other expense,\nexcluding the charitable contribution to the\nTruist Foundation, lower amortization of\nintangibles, and operating lease depreciation,\npartially offset by a $150 million charitable\ncontribution to the Truist Foundation (other\nexpense) and higher professional fees and\noutside processing expense. Restructuring\ncharges decreased $200 million; both periods\nincluded restructuring charges for severance\ncharges as well as facilities optimization\ncosts. Noninterest expenses excluding the\ncharitable contribution, the amortization of\nintangibles, the FDIC special assessment\nadjustment, restructuring charges, and a small\nloss on the early extinguishment of debt,\ndecreased $44 million, or 0.4%.\n\n\u2022 Other expense, excluding the aforementioned\ncharitable contribution to the Truist\nFoundation, decreased primarily due to lower\npension expense, the prior period costs\nassociated with a revision in deposit service\nfee protocols, and the prior period resolution\nof the USAA remote deposit capture patent\ninfringement lawsuit.\n\n\u2022 Operating lease depreciation decreased due\nto the runoff of operating lease balances.\n\n\u2022 Professional fees and outside processing\nexpense increased due to higher investments in\ntechnology and risk infrastructure.\n\nTruist has incurred certain restructuring\ncharges, which include:\n\n\u2022 severance and personnel-related costs or\ncredits;\n\n\u2022 occupancy and equipment charges or credits,\nwhich relate to costs or gains associated with\nlease terminations, obsolete equipment write-\noffs, and the sale of duplicate facilities and\nequipment;\n\n\u2022 professional services, which relate to legal\nand investment banking advisory fees and other\nconsulting services pertaining to\nrestructuring initiatives or transactions; and\n\n\u2022 write-offs related to exiting certain\nbusinesses.\n\nRestructuring accruals are established when\nthe costs are incurred or once all\nrequirements for a plan to dispose of or\noutsource certain business functions have been\napproved by management. Restructuring accruals\nare re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as\nnecessary. The remaining accruals at December\n31, 2024 are generally expected to be utilized\nwithin one year, unless they relate to\nspecific contracts that expire later.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 53\nThe following table presents a summary of\nrestructuring charges and the related\naccruals.

The\nCompany\u2019s business segment structure is based\non the manner in which financial information\nis evaluated by management as well as the\nproducts and services provided or the type of\nclient served.\n\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group,\nrepresenting substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s IH segment, which represented a\nmaterial strategic shift for the Company, and\nas a result, the Company recast results for\nall periods presented under the discontinued\noperations basis of presentation. On May 6,\n2024, the Company completed the sale of its\nremaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the\nprincipal legal entity of the IH segment. As\nthe operations of TIH were included in\ndiscontinued operations prior to the sale of\nTIH, the Company no longer presents the IH\nsegment as one of its reportable segments.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information related to discontinued\noperations.\n\nEffective October 1, 2024, the Company\u2019s\ncorporate expense allocation methodology was\nenhanced to allocate certain overhead or\nfunctional expenses based on actual OT&C\nnoninterest expense performance. Prior period\nresults have been revised for the CSBB, WB,\nand OT&C segments to conform to the current\nallocation methodology.\n\nAs a result of the methodology change, CSBB\nnoninterest expense increased $267 million and\n$639 million for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, with an off-\nsetting decrease in OT&C noninterest expense.\nFor the same reason, WB noninterest expense\nincreased $325 million and $101 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, with an off-setting decrease in\nOT&C noninterest expense.\n                                              \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n                                  \u2026      \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026        \u2026      \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026               \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026               \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026               \u2026    \n           \u2026      \u2026      \u2026        \u2026      \u2026    \n                                              \n54 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n2024 compared to 2023\n                                              \n  Consumer and Small Business Banking         \n                                              \nCSBB net income was $3.5 billion for the year\nended December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.4\nbillion compared to the prior year.\n\n\u2022 Segment net interest income decreased $106\nmillion primarily driven by lower loan and\ndeposit balances, partially offset by higher\nfunding credit on deposits.\n\n\u2022 The allocated provision for credit losses\nincreased $192 million primarily reflecting\nhigher charge-offs in the other consumer,\ncredit card, and indirect auto portfolios and\nan allowance build in the current period\ncompared to same period last year.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest income increased $30 million\nprimarily due to increased service charges on\ndeposits, partially offset by lower card and\npayment related fees in the current period.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense decreased $3.6 billion\nincluding the goodwill impairment in the prior\nyear.

U.S.\nTreasury, GSE, and Agency MBS represented\n99.7% and 97.2% of the total securities\nportfolio as of December 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively. The overwhelming\nmajority of the portfolio is in agency MBS\nsecurities.\n\n\u2022 The decrease in 2024 includes sales of $28.1\nbillion and maturities and paydowns of $18.7\nbillion, partially offset by $44.7 billion in\npurchases. The purchases and sales were\nprimarily related to the balance sheet\nrepositioning.\n\n\u25e6 Following the sale of TIH, which resulted in\nafter-tax cash proceeds to Truist of\napproximately $10.1 billion, Truist executed a\nstrategic balance sheet repositioning of a\nportion of its AFS investment securities\nportfolio by selling $27.7 billion of lower-\nyielding investment securities, resulting in\nan after-tax loss of $5.1 billion in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The investment\nsecurities that were sold had a book value of\n$34.4 billion and a weighted average book\nyield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024\nincluding the impact of hedges and based on\nthe Federal Funds futures curve at the time.\nIncluding the tax benefit, the repositioning\ngenerated $29.3 billion available for\nreinvestment.\n\n\u25e6 Truist invested approximately $18.7 billion\nof the $39.4 billion available, including the\n$10.1 billion after-tax proceeds from the sale\nof TIH, in shorter duration investment\nsecurities yielding 5.27%. The remaining $20.7\nbillion was invested in cash. The blended\nreinvestment rate on the new investment\nsecurities purchased and cash was 5.22% for\nthe remainder of 2024 including the impact of\nhedges and based on the Federal Funds futures\ncurve at the time.\n\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, 41% of the investment securities\nportfolio was classified as held-to-maturity\nbased on amortized cost, excluding portfolio\nlevel basis adjustments.\n\n\u2022 As of December 31, 2024, approximately 3.0%\nof the securities portfolio was variable rate,\nexcluding the impact of swaps, compared to\n5.7% as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\u2022 The effective duration of the AFS securities\nportfolio was 5.0 years at December 31, 2024\nand 6.1 years at December 31, 2023, excluding\nthe impact of swaps, or 3.3 years at December\n31, 2024 and 4.0 years at December 31, 2023,\nincluding the impact of swaps.

Management believes that this purpose\ncan best be accomplished by building strong\nclient relationships over time and developing\nin-depth local market knowledge. The Company\nemploys underwriting criteria governing the\ndegree of risk assumed and the diversity of\nthe loan portfolio in terms of type, industry,\nand geographical concentration.\n\nTruist lends to a diverse client base that is\nmanaged to be geographically dispersed to\nmitigate concentration risk arising from local\nand regional economic downturns. The following\ndiscussion provides additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolios. Refer\nto the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section for a\ndiscussion of the credit risk management\npolicies used to manage the portfolios.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 57\nCommercial Loan and Lease Portfolio\n\nCommercial loans and leases represent the\nlargest category of the Company\u2019s loan and\nlease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking\nand small business banking generally target\nsmall-to-middle market businesses with annual\nsales between $2 million and $500 million,\nwhile Investment Banking and Capital Markets\n(formerly Corporate and Investment Banking)\nprovides lending solutions to large corporate\nclients. The commercial loan and lease\nportfolio consists of lending to public and\nprivate business clients and includes\ncommercial and industrial, owner occupied,\nequipment leasing and financing, CRE,\ngovernment and institutional financing,\npremium financing, and dealer floor plan\nfinancing.\n\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s lending\npolicy, each commercial loan undergoes a\ndetailed underwriting process. Commercial\nloans are typically priced with an interest\nrate tied to market indices, such as the prime\nrate or SOFR and are individually monitored\nand reviewed for deterioration in the ability\nof the client to repay the loan. The majority\nof Truist\u2019s commercial loans are secured by\nreal estate, business equipment, inventories,\nand other types of collateral.\n\nResidential Mortgage Loan Portfolio\n\nTruist primarily originates conforming\nmortgage loans, loans under FHA, U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, or U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture programs, and higher\nquality jumbo and construction-to-permanent\nloans for 1-4 family residential properties.\nConforming loans are loans that are\nunderwritten in accordance with the\nunderwriting standards set forth by FNMA and\nFHLMC. They are generally collateralized by\none-to-four-family residential real estate,\ntypically have loan-to-collateral value ratios\nof 80% or less at origination, or have\nmortgage insurance as required by investors\nand are made to borrowers that meet Truist\u2019s\ncredit standards.\n\nRisks associated with mortgage lending include\ninterest rate risk, which is mitigated through\nthe sale of a substantial portion of\nconforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary\nmortgage market and an effective MSR hedging\nprocess. Credit risk is managed through\nunderwriting procedures and mortgage\ninsurance. The right to service the loans and\nreceive servicing income is generally retained\nwhen conforming loans are sold. Management\nbelieves that the retention of mortgage\nservicing diversifies income while enabling\nTruist to build long-term client relationships\nand offer high quality client service. Truist\nalso purchases residential mortgage loans from\ncorrespondent originators. The loans purchased\nfrom third-party originators are subject to\nsubstantially the same underwriting and risk-\nmanagement criteria as loans originated\ninternally.\n\nHome Equity Loan Portfolio\n\nThe home equity portfolio is composed of loans\noffered through Truist\u2019s branch network. These\ninclude home equity loans and revolving home\nequity lines of credit secured by first or\nsecond liens on residential real estate in\nTruist\u2019s market areas.\n\nIndirect Auto Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect auto portfolio primarily includes\nsecured indirect installment loans to\nconsumers for the purchase of new and used\nautomobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also\nincludes nonprime and near prime automobile\nfinance. Such loans are originated through\napproved franchised and independent dealers\nthroughout the Truist market area and\nnationally through Regional Acceptance\nCorporation. These loans are homogeneous, and\nno single loan is individually significant in\nterms of its size and potential risk of loss.\nIndirect auto loans are subject to lending\npolicies and procedures and are underwritten\nwith note amounts and credit limits that are\nconsistent with the Company\u2019s risk philosophy.\nIn addition to its normal underwriting due\ndiligence, Truist uses application systems and\nscoring systems to help underwrite and manage\nthe credit risk in its indirect auto\nportfolio.\n\nOther Consumer Loan Portfolio\n\nThe other consumer portfolio includes loans\noriginated through the Truist branch network,\nas well as loans originated by Truist\u2019s\nnational online consumer lending platforms.\nThe other consumer loan portfolio includes:\nsecured and unsecured loans originated through\nthe Truist branch network marketed to\nqualifying clients and other creditworthy\ncandidates in Truist\u2019s market areas;\nLightStream, an online platform which\noriginates fixed-rate, unsecured lending to\nconsumers with strong credit; secured indirect\ninstallment loans to consumers for the\npurchase of new and used boats and\nrecreational vehicles; Sheffield, a small\nticket consumer lending division related to\nthe purchase of power sports and outdoor power\nequipment; other indirect and point-of-sale\nlending to consumers, including through\nService Finance, to finance home improvements,\nfurniture purchases, certain elective health-\ncare services; and unsecured loans originated\nvia third-party partnerships, which are in\nrun-off. These loans are homogeneous, and no\nsingle loan is individually significant in\nterms of its size and potential risk of loss.\nThese loans are originated in accordance with\nunderwriting criteria as determined by Truist.\n\n58 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCredit Card Loan Portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio consists of the\noutstanding balances on credit cards for\ncommercial and consumer clients.

process for credit approval\naccountability;\n\n\u2022 initial underwriting and analysis of\nborrower, transaction, market, and collateral\nrisks;\n\n\u2022 evaluating the diversity of the loan\nportfolio in terms of type, industry, and\ngeographical concentration;\n\n\u2022 ongoing servicing and monitoring of\nindividual loans and lending relationships;\n\n\u2022 continuous monitoring of the portfolio,\nmarket dynamics, and the economy; and\n\n\u2022 periodically reevaluating the Company\u2019s\nstrategy and overall exposure as economic,\nmarket, and other relevant conditions change.\n\nTruist monitors various segments of its credit\nportfolios to assess potential concentration\nrisks. Management is involved in the credit\napproval and review process, and risk\nacceptance criteria are adjusted as needed to\nreflect the Company\u2019s risk appetite.\nConsistent with established risk management\nobjectives, the Company utilizes various risk\nmitigation techniques, including collecting\ncollateral and security interests, obtaining\nguarantees, and, to a limited extent, through\nthe purchase of credit loss protection via\nthird-party insurance or use of credit\nderivatives such as credit default swaps.\n\nIn the commercial portfolio, risk\nconcentrations are evaluated regularly on both\nan aggregate portfolio level and on an\nindividual client basis. The Company manages\nits commercial exposure through portfolio\ntargets, limits, and transactional risk\nacceptance criteria as well as other\ntechniques, including loan\nsyndications/participations, loan sales,\ncollateral, structure, covenants, and other\nrisk reduction techniques.\n\nThe following tables provide industry\ndistribution by major types of commercial\ncredit exposure and the geographical\ndistribution of commercial exposures. Industry\nclassification for commercial and industrial\nloans is based on the North American Industry\nClassification System. CRE loans are\nclassified based on type of property.

charge-offs during 2024 totaled $1.8\nbillion, or 0.59% as a percentage of average\nloans, and were up nine basis points compared\nto the prior year, primarily driven by higher\ncharge-offs in the CRE, other consumer, credit\ncard, and indirect auto portfolios, partially\noffset by the sale of the student loan\nportfolio in the prior year.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses was $5.2\nbillion and includes $4.9 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $304\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.59%,\ncompared to 1.54% at December 31, 2023. The\nincrease in the ALLL ratio primarily reflects\nincreases in reserves related to the CRE,\ncommercial construction, and certain consumer\nnon-real estate portfolios, as well as\ndeclines in commercial and industrial\nbalances. The ALLL covered nonperforming loans\nand leases held for investment 3.4x compared\nto 3.5x at December 31, 2023.

Interest rates paid on\nspecific deposit types are determined based on\n(i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the\nanticipated amount and timing of funding\nneeds, (iii) the availability and cost of\nalternative sources of funding, and (iv)\nanticipated future economic conditions and\ninterest rates. Deposits are attractive\nsources of funding because of their stability\nand relative cost.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of\ndeposits:\n                                              \n  Table 29:                                   \n  Deposits                                    \n  as of                                       \n  Period                                      \n  End                                         \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Noninter\u2026    $     107,451    $    111,624  \n  deposits                                    \n  Interest           109,042         104,757  \n  checking                                    \n  Money                                       \n  market             137,307         135,923  \n  and                                         \n  savings                                     \n  Time                36,724          43,561  \n  deposits                                    \n  Total        $     390,524    $    395,865  \n  deposits                                    \n                                              \nDeposits totaled $390.5 billion at December\n31, 2024, a decrease of $5.3 billion from\nDecember 31, 2023.

Short-term\nborrowings fluctuate based on the Company\u2019s\nfunding needs. While deposits remain the\nprimary source for funding loan originations,\nmanagement uses short-term borrowings as a\nsupplementary funding source for loan growth\nand other balance sheet management purposes.\nThe following table summarizes certain\ninformation for the past three years with\nrespect to short-term borrowings excluding\ntrading liabilities, hedges, and collateral in\nexcess of

A key objective of the Company\u2019s\nrisk management framework is to promote the\nexecution of strategic goals and objectives in\nalignment with its risk appetite.\n\nTruist has developed a risk management\ntaxonomy to provide for the identification and\nclassification of risk elements at Truist. The\nobjective of the risk management taxonomy is\nto define enterprise-wide categorization for\nelements used in risk management activities,\nestablish consistently applied language, and\nenable data analysis, aggregation, and\nreporting.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports the identification and\nescalation of risks across the organization.\nAll teammates are responsible for upholding\nthe Company\u2019s purpose, mission, and values,\nand are encouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities must be evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nTruist\u2019s compensation plans are designed to\nconsider teammates\u2019 adherence to and\nsuccessful implementation of Truist\u2019s risk\nvalues and associated policies and procedures.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation structure is\ndesigned to support its core values and sound\nrisk management practices in an effort to\npromote judicious risk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist\u2019s risk appetite is defined as the level\nof risk exposure Truist is willing to assume\nto realize its purpose, mission, and values,\nas well as achieve its strategic objectives,\ndeliver shareholder returns, and maintain the\nsafety and soundness of Truist. Truist\u2019s RMO\nprovides independent oversight and guidance\nfor risk-taking across the enterprise. In\nkeeping with the belief that consistent values\ndrive long-term behaviors, Truist\u2019s RMO has\nestablished four key behaviors all teammates\nare expected to practice daily \u2013 regardless of\nrole:\n\n\u2022 Awareness: demonstrate an appropriate\nunderstanding of enterprise and business unit\nrisks and the controls required to mitigate\nthem. Complete required risk and compliance\ntraining within deadlines. Comply with risk\nrelated applicable Truist policies.\n\n\u2022 Identification: proactively recognize\nbusiness concerns, issues, risks, or emerging\nrisks as they arise in day-to-day activities.\n\n\u2022 Escalation: speak up, report, and elevate\nconcerns, issues, and risks as soon as\npossible to appropriate parties.\n\n\u2022 Mitigation: consistently execute risk\nrelated applicable procedures and processes as\ndesigned for day-to-day activities. Maintain\nand execute effective controls to manage risk\nwithin risk appetite. As applicable, complete\nsuccessful and timely remediation of assigned\nissues.\n\nThe BRC assists the Board in its oversight of\nthe Company\u2019s risk management function. The\nBRC is responsible for approving and\nperiodically reviewing the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework and risk management\npolicies as well as monitoring the Company\u2019s\nrisk profile, approving risk appetite\nstatements, and providing input to management\nregarding Truist\u2019s risk appetite and risk\nprofile.\n\nThe RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible\nfor overseeing the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring, management, and\nreporting of risk. The CRO has direct access\nto the Board to communicate any risk issues\n(current or emerging) as well as the\nperformance of the risk management activities\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\nThe risk management framework is supported by\na three-lines-of-defense structure with unique\nroles and responsibilities for executing risk\nmanagement activities, maintaining independent\noversight, and providing independent\nassurance. The 1st line of defense (1LOD)\nincludes the business units which originate\nand own the risk and GCO, which is described\nbelow. The 2nd line of defense (2LOD) is the\nindependent risk management function provided\nby the RMO. The 3rd line of defense (3LOD) is\nthe independent assurance function provided by\nTruist Audit Services.\n\nThe GCO standardizes first-line risk execution\nand ownership across the Company in\npartnership with the business units and\nenterprise functions. As part of the first-\nline of defense, the GCO provides risk advice\nand oversight, issues management, testing,\nreporting, and business continuity expertise\nto first-line execution efforts. The GCO\ncoordinates closely with the RMO in executing\nthese responsibilities.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist\u2019s Committee and Risk Reporting\nGovernance Program is designed to provide\ncomprehensive Board and management risk\noversight, maintaining a committee governance\nstructure that supports alignment and\nexecution of the risk management framework.\nThe committee structure provides a mechanism\nto allow for efficient aggregation and\nescalation of risk information from the\nbusiness units up to management and ultimately\nthe Board. Truist\u2019s committee structure is\nbroken down into three levels of committees:\n\n\u2022 Level I committees: Board committees\nestablished by the Board to assist in its\noversight of the Company. Level I committees\nare subject to governance directly by the\nBoard, the respective Board committee\ncharters, the bylaws of Truist, and the Truist\ncorporate governance guidelines.\n\n\u2022 Level II committees: appointed by a Level I\ncommittee with a direct reporting relationship\nand with the annual review and approval of its\ncharter by the appointing Level I committee.\n\n\u2022 Level III committees: appointed by a Level\nI, II, or III committee with a direct\nreporting relationship with, and the annual\nreview and approval of its charter by, the\nappointing \u201cparent\u201d Level I, II, or III\ncommittee.\n\nThis committee structure includes management\ncommittees that are responsible for providing\nindependent risk oversight of each of Truist\u2019s\nprimary risk types and comprehensive coverage\nof Truist\u2019s strategy, risk-taking and\nexecution activities. Examples of such\ncommittees include the ERC and Management\nCompensation Oversight Committee.\n\nThe ERC serves as the enterprise-wide risk\ngovernance body authorized by the BRC with\nresponsibility for broad strategic oversight\nof all risk types and establishing an\nintegrated view of risks across Truist at the\nenterprise level. The ERC is responsible for\nmaintaining a risk management framework and\nmonitoring its adoption and execution across\nthe enterprise. The ERC is chaired by the CRO\nand its membership includes the CEO, CFO,\nChief Audit Officer, and other designated\nmembers of Truist management.\n\nPrincipal types of inherent risk include\nmarket, credit, liquidity, technology,\ncompliance, strategic, reputational, and\noperational risks. The following is a\ndiscussion of these risks.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in interest rates,\nspreads, or prices of financial instruments,\nand the corresponding impact on the\ncomposition of the balance sheet or trading\nand fair value positions. Market risk results\nfrom changes in the level, volatility, or\ncorrelations among financial market risk\nfactors or prices, including interest rates,\ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates,\nequity, and commodity prices.\n\nTruist\u2019s most significant market risk exposure\nis to interest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk of instruments held in\nTruist\u2019s business units. Interest rate risk\nresults from: differences between the timing\nof rate changes and the timing of cash flows\nassociated with assets and liabilities (re-\npricing risk); changing rate relationships\namong different yield curves affecting bank\nactivities (basis risk); changing rate\nrelationships across the spectrum of\nmaturities (yield curve risk); and interest-\nrelated options inherently embedded in bank\nproducts (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of market risk\nmanagement are to minimize adverse effects\nfrom changes in market risk factors on net\ninterest income, net income, and capital, and\nto offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTruist primarily monitors this risk through\ntwo measurement types, (i) NII at risk and\n(ii) economic value of equity. Truist manages\nthis risk with securities, derivatives, and\nbroader asset liability management activities.\nTruist uses derivatives to hedge interest\nincome variability of floating rate loans and\nto hedge valuation changes of long-term debt\nand investment securities.\n\nIRR measurement is reported monthly through\nthe ALCO. Monthly IRR reporting includes\nexposure and historical trends relative to\nrisk limit scenarios, impacts to a wide range\nof rate scenarios, and sensitivity tests of\nkey assumptions. IRR reporting is provided to\nthe BRC quarterly.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nIRR measurement is influenced by data,\nassumptions, and models. Due to their high\nsensitivity to market rates, mortgage (loan\nand security) prepayments leverage an industry\nmodel that results in varying prepayment\nspeeds across rate scenarios. Prepayments for\nnon-mortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic\nmodels (varying results based on market rates)\nand static prepayment assumptions based on\nhistorical experience. Prior to December 2024,\ninterest-bearing-deposit rate paid was\nprojected to move at a constant ratio (deposit\nbeta) of market rates, primarily the Federal\nFunds Rate, aligned to historical through the\ncycle experience, and deposit balances in\nalternate scenarios were aligned to the Truist\nbaseline scenario. In December 2024, we\nenhanced our deposit methodology to more\ndynamically incorporate client deposit balance\nlevels, the mix across product types, and\ndeposit rate paid across alternate rate\nscenarios based on modeled changes in customer\nand bank behavior.\n\nNII at risk measures the change in NII under\nalternate interest rate scenarios relative to\nTruist\u2019s baseline scenario, which incorporates\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges as well as expectations for new\nbusiness over the forecast horizon. Truist\u2019s\nbaseline scenario relies on assumptions\nincluding expectations of the economy and\ninterest rates \u2013 which are influenced by\nmarket conditions, new business volume,\npricing, and customer behavior. In measuring\nNII at risk, Truist assumes that changes in\nkey factors, such as prepayments and deposit\npricing (betas), largely move in line with\nthose it has experienced in prior rate cycles.\nHowever, future behavior of key factors may\nvary from Truist\u2019s assumptions. NII at risk\nmeasurement assumes, when applicable, that\nU.S. interest rates floor at zero and Truist\ndoes not take any balance sheet or hedging\nactions in response to the rate scenarios.\n\nTruist evaluates a wide range of alternate\nscenarios including instantaneous and gradual\nas well as parallel and non-parallel changes\nin interest rates. The table below presents\nthe estimated change to NII over the following\n12 months for select parallel alternate\nscenarios, expressed as a percentage change\nrelative to baseline NII.\n\nThe change in simulation analysis results from\nDecember 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 in the\ntable below was primarily due to the\naforementioned enhanced deposit methodology.\nThe use of dynamic deposit balance models\nresults in rotation to higher cost funding\nproducts (e.g., CDs) when market rates\nincrease and to lower cost funding products\n(e.g., non-maturity deposits) when market\nrates decrease. The use of dynamic rate paid\nmodels results in varying deposit betas based\non the timing and conditions within market\nrate cycles but generally result in lower\nbetas in the simulation analysis results than\nthe prior methodology due to beta lag effects\nrelative to changes in market rates. These\nupdates were made to better reflect expected\ndeposit behavior and Truist\u2019s NII rate\nsensitivity to changes in market rates.\nTogether, the incorporation of dynamic deposit\nbalances and dynamic rate paid resulted in\nadding NII in up rate scenarios and reducing\nNII in down rate scenarios.\n                                              \n  Table 34:                                   \n  Interest                                    \n  Sensitiv\u2026                                   \n  Simulati\u2026       Dec 31,         Dec 31,     \n  Analysis           2024            2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Up 200bps                                   \n  gradual                                     \n  change in           1.1  %         -1.5  %  \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Up 50bps                                    \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  change in           0.6            -0.4     \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Down                                        \n  50bps                                       \n  instanta\u2026          -0.8            -0.1     \n  change in                                   \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Down                                        \n  200bps                                      \n  gradual            -2.1            -0.3     \n  change in                                   \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n                                              \nTruist performs and monitors sensitivity tests\nof key assumptions used in NII risk including:\n\n\u2022 Asset prepayment speeds\n\n\u2022 New loan volume pricing spreads\n\n\u2022 Interest-bearing deposit betas\n\n\u2022 Non-interest-bearing demand deposit balance\nrunoff, replaced by market funding\n\nEVE measures changes in the economic value of\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios\nrelative to starting economic value.

Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a multi-faceted risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule,\nwhich were non-agency asset backed securities\npositions, was $100 million. Consistent with\nthe Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company\nperforms pre-purchase due diligence on each\nsecuritization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including deal structure and\nthe asset quality of the underlying assets,\nthat materially affect valuation and\nperformance. Securitization positions are\nsubject to Truist\u2019s risk management framework,\nwhich includes daily monitoring against a\nsuite of limits. There were no off-balance\nsheet securitization positions during the\nreporting period.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of December 31, 2024.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to manage market risk include\nstress testing, scenario analysis, and stop\nloss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended December 31,\n2024. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision models, including\ntrading market risk models. As part of ongoing\nmonitoring efforts, the performance of all\ntrading risk models is reviewed regularly to\nevaluate model performance with emerging\ndevelopments in financial markets, assess\nevolving modeling approaches, and identify\npotential model enhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a range of stress testing\ntechniques to help monitor risks across\ntrading desks and to augment standard daily\nVaR and other risk limits reporting. The\nstress testing framework is designed to\nquantify the impact of extreme, but plausible,\nstress scenarios that could lead to large,\nunexpected losses. Stress tests include\nsimulations for risk factor sensitivities,\nhistorical repeats, and hypothetical scenarios\nwith varying liquidity horizons of key risk\nfactors. All trading positions within each\napplicable market risk category (i.e.,\ninterest rate risk, equity risk, foreign\nexchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and\ncommodity price risk) are included in the\nCompany\u2019s stress testing framework. Management\nreviews stress testing scenarios and makes\nupdates on an ongoing basis. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nCredit risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising when a\nborrower, obligor, issuer, or counterparty\ndoes not meet its financial obligations to us.\nCredit risk is primarily incurred through\nlending activities in the Company\u2019s WB and\nCSBB operating segments. A number of products\nexpose the Company to credit risk, including\nloans and leases, lending commitments,\nderivatives, trading assets, and investment\nsecurities. Changes in credit quality can have\na significant impact on the Company\u2019s earnings\nand capital position.\n\nTruist has established the following general\npractices to manage credit risk:\n\n\u2022 limiting the amount of credit that\nindividual lenders may extend to a borrower;\n\n\u2022 establishing a process for credit approval\naccountability;\n\n\u2022 careful initial underwriting and analysis of\nborrower, transaction, market, and collateral\nrisks;\n\n\u2022 ongoing servicing and monitoring of\nindividual loans and lending relationships;\n\n\u2022 maintaining collections and asset resolution\nteams;\n\n\u2022 continuous monitoring of the portfolio,\nconcentration and transactional limits,\nemerging risks, market dynamics and the\neconomy; and\n\n\u2022 periodically reevaluating the Company\u2019s\nstrategy and overall exposure as economic,\nmarket and other relevant conditions change.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\nThe following discussion describes the\nunderwriting procedures and overall risk\nmanagement of Truist\u2019s lending function.\n\nUnderwriting Approach\n\nThe loan portfolio is a primary source of\nprofitability and risk; therefore, proper loan\nunderwriting is critical to Truist\u2019s long-term\nfinancial success. Truist\u2019s underwriting\napproach is designed to define acceptable\ncombinations of specific risk-mitigating\nfeatures that promote credit relationships\nthat conform to Truist\u2019s risk philosophy.\nProvided below is a summary of the most\nsignificant underwriting criteria used to\nevaluate new loans and loan renewals:\n\n\u2022 Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash\nflow adequacy is a necessary condition of\ncreditworthiness, meaning that loans must\neither be clearly supported by a borrower\u2019s\ncash flow or, if not, must be justified by\nsecondary repayment sources.\n\n\u2022 Secondary sources of repayment - alternative\nrepayment funds are a significant risk-\nmitigating factor as long as they are liquid,\ncan be easily accessed, and provide adequate\nresources to supplement the primary cash flow\nsource.\n\n\u2022 Value of any underlying collateral - loans\nare generally secured by the asset being\nfinanced. Because an analysis of the primary\nand secondary sources of repayment is the most\nimportant factor, collateral, unless it is\nliquid, does not justify loans that cannot be\nserviced by the borrower\u2019s primary and\nsecondary cash flows.\n\n\u2022 Overall creditworthiness of the client,\ntaking into account the client\u2019s\nrelationships, both past and current, with\nTruist and other lenders - Truist\u2019s success\ndepends on building lasting and mutually\nbeneficial relationships with clients, which\ninvolves assessing their financial position\nand background.\n\n\u2022 Level of equity invested in the transaction\n- in general, borrowers are required to\ncontribute or invest a portion of their own\nfunds prior to any loan advances.\n\nRefer to the \u201cLending Activities\u201d section in\nMD&A for a discussion of each loan and lease\nportfolio.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risk                              \n                                              \nLiquidity risk is the risk that Truist will be\nunable, or that market participants may\nperceive Truist to be unable, to fund\nincreases in its assets and meet its financial\nobligations at a reasonable cost and in a\ntimely manner. Refer to the \u201cLiquidity\u201d\nsection in MD&A for additional discussion.\n                                              \n  Technology Risk                             \n                                              \nTechnology risk is the risk associated with\nthe disruption or failure of technology that\nnegatively impacts business operations. Truist\nhas defined and adopted a technology risk\nframework that provides the foundation for its\ntechnology risk strategy, program, and\noversight and defines key objectives,\noperating model components, risk domains, and\ncapabilities to manage this risk.\n\nRefer to Item 1C, \u201cCybersecurity\u201d for a\ndiscussion regarding Truist\u2019s cybersecurity\nrisk management, strategy, and governance.\n\nData Analytics, AI, and Generative AI Risks\n\nData risk is the risk to current or projected\nfinancial condition, operations, strategic\nobjectives, and regulatory compliance arising\nfrom inadequate data accuracy, completeness,\nconsistency, timeliness, relevance, integrity,\nand validity (i.e., data fidelity). Inadequate\ndata fidelity can negatively impact regulatory\nand management reporting, public disclosures,\nand business decisions.\n\nTruist recognizes the importance of\nmaintaining accurate and reliable data and\nmaintains a formal data risk management\nprogram that is designed to mitigate risks\nrelated to data fidelity. Through active data\nrisk monitoring and accuracy testing, Truist\nseeks to provide reasonable assurance over\ndata-related processes, risks, and controls,\nas well as the quality and retention of key\ndata used for operational, strategic,\nregulatory, and compliance purposes.\nManagement and the Board provide oversight of\nthe data risk management program and receive\nregular updates from the RMO.\n\nTruist\u2019s AI program is foundationally based on\nthe National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology AI Risk Management Framework Core,\nwhich provides outcomes and actions that\nenable dialogue, understanding, and activities\nto manage AI risks and develop trustworthy AI\nsystems.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or\nregulatory sanctions, financial loss, or\ndamage to reputation as a result of\nnoncompliance with (i) applicable laws,\nregulations, rules or other regulatory\nrequirements (for example, the risk of\nconsumer or wholesale clients experiencing\neconomic loss or other legal harm as a result\nof noncompliance with relevant laws,\nrequirements or regulations, such as the BSA\nand its related laws and regulations); (ii)\ninternal policies and procedures, standards of\nbest practice or codes of conduct; and (iii)\nprinciples of integrity and fair dealing\napplicable to Truist\u2019s activities and\nfunctions.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risk                              \n                                              \nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings,\ncapital, franchise value, stakeholder\nconfidence, and human capital arising from\nineffective strategy, inability to adapt to\nchanges in operating environment, adverse\nbusiness decisions, or improper execution of\nstrategic initiatives.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risk                           \n                                              \nReputational risk is the risk to current or\nfuture earnings, capital and resilience\narising from negative publicity or stakeholder\nopinion, whether real or perceived, regarding\nTruist\u2019s business practices, products,\nservices, transactions, or other activities\nundertaken by Truist, its representatives, or\nits partners that may adversely impair\nTruist\u2019s brand and public confidence,\nrelationship with clients, teammates,\nstakeholders, or communities. The Company\nmonitors, identifies, and internally escalates\npotential reputational risk events and\nendeavors to mitigate such reputational risks\nin a timely manner. Truist seeks to provide\ntransparent and accurate communication, both\ninternally and externally, to respond to key\nstakeholders on issues or events that could\ngive rise to potential reputational risk.\nTruist utilizes an established risk taxonomy\nthat is used to help identify, measure, and\nmonitor reputational risk that enables clear\ntransparently communication to stakeholders on\nthe level of potential risk faced by the\nCompany which in turn allows for effective\nmanagement of risk to acceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to operating in a manner\nthat reflects the Company\u2019s stated purpose,\nmission, and values and seeks to protect its\nreputation, public confidence, and resilience\nby identifying and evaluating associated risks\nthat conflict with the expectations of the\nCompany\u2019s internal and external stakeholders,\nincluding clients, teammates, investors,\nregulators, and communities.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk of loss\nassociated with inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people, systems, or from external\nevents. It includes legal risk, which is the\nrisk of loss arising from defective\ntransactions, litigation or claims made, or\nthe failure to adequately protect company-\nowned assets. An operational loss occurs when\nan event results in a loss or reserve\noriginating from operational risk.\n\nModel Risk\n\nModel risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital from decisions\nbased on incorrect or misused model outputs.\nTruist uses models for many purposes,\nincluding the valuation of financial\npositions, estimation of credit losses, and\nthe measurement of risk. Valuation models are\nused to value certain financial instruments\nfor which quoted prices may not be readily\navailable. Valuation models are also used as\ninputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself,\nregulatory capital, stress testing, and the\nACL. Models are owned by the applicable\nbusiness units, which are responsible for the\ndevelopment, implementation, and use of their\nmodels. Oversight of these functions is\nperformed by the MRO, which is a component of\nthe RMO. Once models have been approved by\nMRO, model owners are responsible for the\nmaintenance of an appropriate operating\nenvironment and must monitor and evaluate the\nperformance of the models on a recurring\nbasis. Models are updated in response to\nchanges in portfolio composition, industry and\neconomic conditions, technological\ncapabilities, and other developments.\n\nMRO seeks to manage model risk through a suite\nof model governance and model validation\nactivities. The risk of each model is assessed\nand classified into various risk tiers.\nAdditionally, MRO maintains an enterprise-wide\nmodel inventory containing relevant model\ninformation. Regarding model validation, MRO\nutilizes internal validation analysts and\nmanagers with skill sets in predictive\nmodeling to perform detailed reviews of model\ndevelopment, implementation, and conceptual\nsoundness. On certain occasions, the MRO will\nalso engage external parties to assist with\nvalidation efforts. Once in a production\nenvironment, MRO assesses a model\u2019s\nperformance on a periodic basis through\nongoing monitoring reviews. MRO tracks issues\nthat have been identified during model\nvalidation or through ongoing monitoring and\nengages with model owners to drive timely\nremediation. MRO gauges model risk utilizing a\ncollection of key risk indicators, which are\nperiodically reported to relevant committees,\nincluding the Model Risk Management Committee\nand the ERC. MRO will also present model risk\ntopics to the BRC as necessary.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 79\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in\nassets and meet obligations as they come due,\nall without incurring unacceptable costs. In\naddition to the level of liquid assets, such\nas cash, cash equivalents, and highly liquid\nunencumbered securities, other factors affect\nthe ability to meet liquidity needs, including\naccess to a variety of funding sources,\nmaintaining borrowing capacity, growing core\ndeposits, loan repayment, and the ability to\nsecuritize or package loans for sale.\n\nTruist has a liquidity risk management process\ndesigned to identify, measure, and monitor key\nliquidity risks to assess whether Truist is\noperating within its liquidity risk appetite.\nThe liquidity risk appetite is outlined using\na qualitative statement and more granular\ndetailed risk appetite statements aligned to\nTruist\u2019s risk taxonomy; risk statements form\nthe basis for aligning risk appetite with risk\nmanagement goals and strategy. Using the risk\nappetite statements, key risk indicators are\ndeveloped that represent quantitative metrics\nwhich measure current risk exposure relative\nto Truist\u2019s risk appetite, which help the\nBoard and management monitor liquidity risk\ntaking activity. Truist\u2019s key risk indicators\nare designed to support the following\nobjectives:\n\n\u2022 maintain (i) a diversified, but customer\ndeposit centric, funding base, (ii) a level of\nliquid, readily monetized assets sufficient to\nsatisfy business as usual and stressed cash\nflow needs across multiple liquidity horizons,\nand (iii) an appropriate level of contingent\nfunding to meet any unexpected needs;\n\n\u2022 limit concentration risk from individual,\ncorrelated counterparties, and funding\nconcentrations in tenors that may negatively\nimpact Truist from an unforeseen idiosyncratic\nor market event; and\n\n\u2022 maintain sufficient liquidity in the holding\ncompany to serve as a source of strength to\nits subsidiaries.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is conducted for\nTruist and Truist Bank using a variety of\ninstitution-specific and market-wide adverse\nscenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario\napplies defined assumptions to execute sources\nand uses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, increased\ndraws on unfunded commitments, and the\npotential need to post additional collateral\nfor derivatives. To mitigate liquidity\noutflows, Truist has identified sources of\nliquidity; however, access to these sources of\nliquidity could be affected within a stressed\nenvironment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is designed to meet the projected 30-day\nnet stressed cash-flow needs. Truist\u2019s\nliquidity buffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule. Truist periodically monetizes a\nrepresentative sample of the liquidity buffer\nto assess operational readiness through\navailable monetization channels.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto address ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction. On a quarterly basis, Truist\nconducts testing of market access for\nalternative sources of funds (e.g. discount\nwindow, standing repo facility, etc.) to test\noperational readiness. On an periodic basis,\nTruist conducts a table-top test of the\nContingency Funding Plan to assess reliability\nof the plan during liquidity stress events and\nto simulate the operational elements of the\nplan such as communications, coordination, and\ndecision-making.\n\nLCR, NSFR, and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient within the parameters of the\nrule to meet their estimated total net cash\noutflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day\nperiod of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes\nof calculating the LCR, is the amount of\nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $89.6 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 109% for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2024.\n\nThe NSFR rule defines a minimum amount of\nstable, long-term funding that Truist and\nTruist Bank must maintain in relation to their\nasset composition and off-balance sheet\nactivities. Truist and Truist Bank are subject\nto the Category III reduced NSFR requirements.\nAt December 31, 2024, Truist was compliant\nwith this requirement.\n\n80 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSources of Funds\n\nTruist funds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources, including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 37:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      72,040    $     55,252  \n  FHLB                31,411          24,712  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           68,212          77,029  \n  (at fair                                    \n  value)                                      \n  Available                                   \n  secured            171,663         156,993  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             33,717          25,085  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     205,380    $    182,078  \n                                              \nAt December 31, 2024, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 4.4 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $1.7\nbillion in obligations to purchase goods or\nservices that are enforceable and legally\nbinding. Many of the purchase obligations have\nterms that are not fixed and determinable and\nare included in the total amount of\nobligations based upon the estimated timing\nand amount of payment. In addition, certain of\nthe purchase agreements contain clauses that\nwould allow Truist to cancel the agreement\nwith specified notice; however, that impact is\nnot included in determining the total amount\nof obligations. See \u201cNote 9. Other Assets and\nLiabilities,\u201d \u201cNote 11. Borrowings,\u201d and \u201cNote\n16. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d for\nadditional information regarding outstanding\nbalances of sources of liquidity and\ncontractual commitments and obligations.\n\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for its operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock,\npayments on and, from time-to-time, potential\nrepurchases or redemptions of a portion of an\noutstanding tranche of the long-term debt of\nthe Parent Company (as may be permitted by the\nterms of each respective series), and the\nredemption of preferred stock. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist manages cash levels at the\nParent Company to exceed a minimum of 12\nmonths of projected cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At December 31, 2024, the\nParent Company held cash on hand to meet these\nrequirements.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends.

Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist, for the\nParent Company to remain a source of strength\nfor the Parent Company\u2019s subsidiaries, and\nprovide a competitive return to shareholders.\nRisk-based capital ratios, which include CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are\ncalculated based on regulatory guidance\nrelated to the measurement of capital and\nrisk-weighted assets.\n\nManagement regularly monitors the capital\nposition of Truist on both a consolidated and\nbank-level basis. In this regard, management\u2019s\nobjective is to maintain capital at levels\nthat are in excess of internal capital limits,\nwhich are above the regulatory \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d minimums. Truist also regularly\nperforms stress testing on its capital levels\nand is required to periodically submit the\nCompany\u2019s capital plans and stress testing\nresults to the banking regulators. Management\nhas implemented internal stress capital ratio\nminimums that serve as limits which are\nmeasured under internally-developed stress\ntesting scenarios to evaluate whether capital\nratios calculated under hypothetical stress,\nand after the effect of alternative capital\nactions, are likely to remain above internal\nstressed minimums. Breaches of internal\ncapital limits or projected breaches of\ninternal stress capital ratio minimums under\nhypothetical stress result in the activation\nof Truist\u2019s capital contingency plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026                                 \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.8%\napplicable to Truist as of December 31, 2024.\nTruist\u2019s SCB requirement, received in the 2024\nCCAR process, is effective from October 1,\n2024 to September 30, 2025.\n\nTruist completed the 2024 CCAR process and\nreceived a SCB requirement of 2.8% for the\nperiod October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025,\ndown 10 basis points from the SCB requirement\nfor the period October 1, 2023 to September\n30, 2024.\n\nPayments of cash dividends and repurchases of\ncommon shares are among the methods used to\nmanage any excess capital generated. In\naddition, management closely monitors the\nParent Company\u2019s double leverage ratio\n(investments in subsidiaries as a percentage\nof shareholders\u2019 equity). The active\nmanagement of the subsidiaries\u2019 equity capital\nis the process used to manage this important\ndriver of Parent Company liquidity and is a\nkey element in the management of Truist\u2019s\ncapital position.\n\nManagement intends to maintain capital at\nTruist Bank at levels that exceed the minimum\ncapital plus CCB. This will also result in\nTruist Bank being \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for\nregulatory purposes.\n\nManagement\u2019s capital deployment plan in order\nof preference is to focus on (i) organic\ngrowth, (ii) dividends, (iii) strategic\nopportunities and acquisitions, and (iv) share\nrepurchases if excess capital is available.\n\n82 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist Bank\u2019s capital ratios are presented in\nthe following table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  40:                                         \n  Capital                                     \n  Ratios -                                    \n  Truist        Dec 31,         Dec 31,       \n  Bank             2024            2023       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CET1             12.6  %         11.7    %  \n  Tier 1           12.6            11.7       \n  capital                                     \n  Total            14.3            13.3       \n  capital                                     \n  Leverage         10.1             9.2       \n  ratio                                       \n  Supplem\u2026                                    \n  leverage          8.5                  7.9  \n  ratio                                       \n                                              \nThe Parent Company\u2019s capital ratios are\npresented in the following table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  41:                                         \n  Capital                                     \n  Ratios                                      \n  -                                           \n  Truist                                      \n  Financ\u2026                                     \n  Corpor\u2026                                     \n  (Dolla\u2026                                     \n  in             Dec 31,          Dec 31,     \n  millio\u2026           2024             2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk-b\u2026                                     \n  CET1              11.5  %          10.1  %  \n  Tier 1            12.9             11.6     \n  capital                                     \n  Total             15.0             13.7     \n  capital                                     \n  Levera\u2026           10.5              9.3     \n  ratio                                       \n  Supple\u2026                                     \n  levera\u2026            8.8              7.9     \n  ratio                                       \n  Risk-w\u2026    $   418,337       $  423,705     \n  assets                                      \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s capital level at December 31, 2024\nremains strong compared to the regulatory\nlevels for well-capitalized banks.

The plan provides a framework\ndesigned to monitor for the occurrence of\nthese events by establishing mechanisms to\ndetect capital contraction, including market\nand economic stress that could adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s capital position. The\nplan also establishes governance protocols for\nactivation or deactivation and decision\nmaking, list capital contingency options and\nassociated key information, and addresses the\nresponsibilities of key departments.\n                                              \n  Reclassifications                           \n                                              \nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications\nhave been made to prior period information to\nconform to the current presentation.

Estimates of expected\nfuture loan and lease losses are determined by\nusing statistical models and management\u2019s\njudgement. The ACL estimation process includes\nboth quantitatively calculated components as\nwell as qualitative components. Quantitative\nmodels are designed to forecast probability of\ndefault, exposure at default and loss given\ndefault by correlating certain macroeconomic\nforecast data to historical experience. The\nmodels are generally applied at the portfolio\nlevel to pools of loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. Certain loans or leases that\ndo not have similar risk characteristics are\nindividually evaluated when establishing an\nallowance for expected credit losses. The\nmacroeconomic forecast data used in the models\nis based on forecasted variables for the\nreasonable and supportable period of two\nyears. Beyond this forecast period the models\ngradually revert to long-term historical loss\nconditions over a one-year period. As a means\nof addressing uncertainty related to future\neconomic conditions, the quantitative\nallowance components include an adjustment\nthat reflects model outputs calculated using a\nrange of potential future economic conditions.\nExpected losses are estimated through\ncontractual maturity, giving appropriate\nconsideration to expected prepayments unless\nthe borrower has a right to renew that is not\ncancellable or to capture the losses expected\nat the balance sheet date or prior to January\n1, 2023 it was reasonably expected that the\nloan will be modified as a TDR.\n\nThe qualitative components of the ACL\nincorporate management\u2019s judgment in\ndetermining qualitative adjustments where\nmodel outputs are inconsistent with\nmanagement\u2019s expectations with respect to\nexpected credit losses. The qualitative\ncomponents are used to adjust for limitations\nin modeled results related to current economic\nconditions, and considerations with respect to\nthe impact of current and expected events or\nrisks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and\nmay not be completely considered by\nquantitative models.\n\nManagement considers a range of macroeconomic\nforecast data in connection with the allowance\nestimation process. Under the range of\nscenarios considered as of December 31, 2024,\nuse of the Company\u2019s pessimistic scenario\nwould have resulted in an increase to the\nmodeled allowance results of approximately\n$2.2 billion. This estimate reflects the\nsensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate\nto macroeconomic forecast data but does not\nconsider other qualitative adjustments that\ncould increase or decrease modeled loss\nestimates calculated using this alternative\neconomic scenario.\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is similar to that used to\ndetermine the funded component of the ALLL and\nis measured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default. A detailed\ndiscussion of the methodology used in\ndetermining the ACL is included in \u201cNote 1.\nBasis of Presentation.\u201d\n                                              \n  Fair Value of Financial Instruments         \n                                              \nThe vast majority of assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis\nare based on either quoted market prices or\nmarket prices for similar instruments. Refer\nto \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures\u201d for\nadditional disclosures regarding the fair\nvalue of financial instruments.\n\nSecurities\n\nTruist generally utilizes a third-party\npricing service in determining the fair value\nof its AFS investment securities, whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. Fair\nvalue measurements for investment securities\nare derived from market-based pricing matrices\nthat were developed using observable inputs\nthat include benchmark yields, benchmark\nsecurities, reported trades, offers, bids,\nissuer spreads, and broker quotes. Management\nperforms procedures to evaluate the fair\nvalues provided by the third-party service\nprovider. These procedures, which are\nperformed independent of the responsible\nbusiness unit, include comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service to other third-party pricing\nsources, review of additional information\nprovided by the third-party pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on security sales to the daily\npricing information received from the third-\nparty pricing service. The Enterprise\nValuation Committee provides oversight to\nTruist\u2019s enterprise-wide IPV function, which\nis responsible for the comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service or internally to other third-\nparty pricing sources, approving tolerance\nlimits determined by IPV for price comparison\nexceptions, reviewing significant changes to\npricing and valuation policies and reviewing\nand approving the pricing decisions made on\nany illiquid and hard-to-price securities.\nWhen market observable data is not available,\nwhich generally occurs due to the lack of\nliquidity or inactive markets for certain\nsecurities, the valuation of the security is\nsubjective and may involve substantial\njudgment by management to reflect unobservable\ninput assumptions.\n\n84 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nMSRs\n\nTruist\u2019s primary class of MSRs for which it\nseparately manages the economic risks relates\nto residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do\nnot trade in an active, open market with\nreadily observable prices. While sales of MSRs\ndo occur, the precise terms and conditions\ntypically are not readily available.\nAccordingly, Truist estimates the fair value\nof residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS\nvaluation model to project residential MSR\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios, which are then discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The OAS model considers\nportfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment\nassumptions, delinquency rates, late charges,\nother ancillary revenue, costs to service and\nother economic factors. Truist reassesses and\nperiodically adjusts the underlying inputs and\nassumptions in the OAS model to reflect market\nconditions and assumptions that a market\nparticipant would consider in valuing the\nresidential MSR asset.\n\nFair value estimates and assumptions are\ncompared to industry surveys, recent market\nactivity, actual portfolio experience and,\nwhen available, observable market data.\nTruist\u2019s enterprise-wide IPV function also\ncompares market data, when available, and\ninformation received from certain third-party\npricing sources, to MSR fair value estimates,\napproving tolerance limits determined by IPV\nfor price comparison exceptions, and reviewing\nsignificant changes to pricing and valuation\npolicies. Due to the nature of the valuation\ninputs, residential MSRs are classified within\nLevel 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value\nof residential MSRs is significantly affected\nby mortgage interest rates available in the\nmarketplace, which influence mortgage loan\nprepayment speeds. In general, during periods\nof declining interest rates, the value of MSRs\ndeclines due to increasing prepayments\nattributable to increased mortgage-refinance\nactivity. Conversely, during periods of rising\ninterest rates, the value of residential MSRs\ngenerally increases due to reduced refinance\nactivity. Truist typically hedges against\nmarket value changes in the residential MSRs.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nquantitative disclosures reflecting the effect\nthat changes in management\u2019s assumptions would\nhave on the fair value of residential MSRs.\n\nTrading Assets and Liabilities\n\nFair value measurements for trading securities\nand securities sold short are derived from\nobservable market-based information including\noverall market conditions, recent trades,\ncomparable securities, broker quotes and\nFINRA\u2019s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\ndata when determining the value of a position.\nSecurity prices are also validated through\nactual cash settlement upon the sale of a\nsecurity. When observable market prices are\nnot available, the Company uses judgment and\nestimates fair value using internal models\nthat reflect assumptions consistent with those\nthat would be used by a market participant in\nestimating fair value. Refer to \u201cNote 18. Fair\nValue Disclosures\u201d for further information on\nthe Company\u2019s trading securities and\nsecurities sold short.\n\nTruist elects to measure certain loans at fair\nvalue for financial reporting where fair value\naligns with the underlying business purpose.\nTrading loans include loans held in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans and loans made or acquired in\nconnection with the Company\u2019s TRS business.\nOther trading liabilities include loans sold,\nbut not yet purchased primarily consisting of\ncommercial and corporate leveraged loans.\nTrading loans and loans sold, but not yet\npurchased are valued primarily using quoted\nprices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar instruments in markets that are not\nactive by a third-party pricing service. Refer\nto \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures\u201d for\nfurther information on the Company\u2019s trading\nloans and other trading liabilities. Refer to\n\u201cNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d and\n\u201cNote 19. Derivative Financial Instruments,\u201d\nfor further discussion of the Company\u2019s TRS\nbusiness.\n\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nTruist uses derivatives to manage various\nfinancial risks and in a dealer capacity to\nfacilitate client transactions. Truist\nmitigates credit risk by subjecting\ncounterparties to credit reviews and approvals\nsimilar to those used in making loans and\nother extensions of credit. In addition,\ncertain counterparties are required to provide\ncollateral to Truist when their unsecured loss\npositions exceed certain negotiated limits.\nThe fair values of derivative financial\ninstruments are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable data for interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments, which\nare related to mortgage loan commitments, is\nbased on quoted market prices adjusted for\ncommitments that Truist does not expect to\nfund and includes the value attributable to\nthe net servicing fee. Refer to \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d for further\ninformation on the Company\u2019s derivatives.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nThe acquisition method of accounting requires\nthat assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin business combinations are recorded at their\nfair values. This often involves estimates\nbased on third-party valuations or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow\nanalyses or other valuation techniques, which\nare inherently subjective. The amortization of\ndefinite-lived intangible assets is based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits to be\nreceived, which is also subjective. Business\ncombinations also typically result in\ngoodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic\nimpairment tests based on the fair values of\nthe reporting units to which the acquired\ngoodwill relates. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for a description of the\nimpairment testing process.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 85\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments.\n\nFollowing the realignment of these business\nactivities, the Company\u2019s three reporting\nunits with goodwill balances are CSBB, WB\nexcluding Wealth, and Wealth. In conjunction\nwith these realignments, goodwill of $1.7\nbillion was realigned to Wealth, residing\nwithin the WB segment, from CSBB based on the\nrelative fair value of CSBB and Wealth, and\ngoodwill of $220 million was realigned to CSBB\nfrom the WB reporting unit based on the\nrelative fair value of the WB reporting unit\nand the realigned small business banking\nclient segmentation. In addition, the Company\ncompleted an assessment of any potential\ngoodwill impairment for all impacted reporting\nunits immediately prior and subsequent to the\nrealignments and determined that no impairment\nexisted. The quantitative valuation of the WB\nreporting unit performed in conjunction with\nthese goodwill realignments indicated that as\nof January 1, 2024, the fair value of the WB\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\nless than 10%, indicating at the time of the\nrealignments that the goodwill of the WB\nreporting unit may be at risk of impairment.\n\nManagement performs a goodwill impairment\nanalysis on an annual basis as of October 1 or\nmore often if events or circumstances indicate\nthat it is more-likely-than not that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is below its\ncarrying value. For its annual impairment\nreview, Truist performed a quantitative test\nof each of its reporting units. The\nquantitative impairment test estimates the\nfair value of the reporting units using the\nincome approach and a market-based approach,\nweighted 50% and 50%, respectively. The inputs\nand assumptions specific to each reporting\nunit are incorporated in the valuations,\nincluding projections of future cash flows,\ndiscount rates, and applicable valuation\nmultiples based on the comparable public\ncompany information. The income approach\nutilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of\nmulti-year financial forecasts developed for\neach reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions such as net interest\nmargin, expected credit losses, noninterest\nincome, noninterest expense, and required\ncapital. The market-based approach utilizes\ncomparable public company information, key\nvaluation multiples, and considers a market\ncontrol premium associated with cost synergies\nand other cash flow benefits that arise from\nobtaining control over a reporting unit, and\nguideline transactions, when applicable.\n\nTruist also assesses the reasonableness of the\naggregate estimated fair value of the\nreporting units by comparison to its market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime, including consideration of expected\nacquirer expense synergies, historic bank\ncontrol premiums, and the current market.\n\nThe projection of net interest margin is the\nmost significant input to the financial\nprojections of the CSBB and WB reporting\nunits, while noninterest income is the most\nsignificant input to the financial projections\nof the Wealth reporting unit. The long-term\ngrowth rate used in determining the terminal\nvalue of each reporting unit was 3% as of\nOctober 1, 2024, based on management\u2019s\nassessment of the minimum expected terminal\ngrowth rate of each reporting unit. Discount\nrates are estimated based on the Capital Asset\nPricing Model, which considers the risk-free\ninterest rate, market risk premium, beta, and\nunsystematic risk adjustments specific to a\nparticular reporting unit. The discount rates\nare also calibrated based on risks related to\nthe projected cash flows of each reporting\nunit. The discount rates utilized for the\nCSBB, Wealth, and WB reporting units as of\nOctober 1, 2024 were 12.5%, 12.0%, and 10.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nBased on the results of the Company\u2019s annual\nimpairment analyses, the Company concluded\nthat the fair values of the CSBB, WB and\nWealth reporting units exceeded their\nrespective carrying values; therefore, there\nwas no goodwill impairment. However, for the\nWB reporting unit, the fair value of the\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\napproximately 10%, indicating that the\ngoodwill of the WB reporting unit may remain\nat risk of impairment. Circumstances that\ncould negatively impact the fair value for the\nWB reporting unit in the future include a\nsustained decrease in Truist\u2019s stock price, a\ndecline in industry peer multiples, an\nincrease in the applicable discount rate, and\ndeterioration in the reporting unit\u2019s\nforecast.\n\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\n\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value. The\nvaluation of the WB reporting unit as of\nOctober 1, 2024 indicated that if the discount\nrate were increased more than 100 basis\npoints, with other cash flow assumptions\nunchanged, the reporting unit\u2019s fair value\nwould be less than its carrying value,\nindicating a goodwill impairment under the\nincome approach. Ultimately, future potential\nchanges in management\u2019s assumptions may impact\nthe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nand cause the fair value of the reporting unit\nto be below its carrying value. Additionally,\na reporting unit\u2019s carrying value could change\nbased on market conditions, change in the\nunderlying makeup of the reporting unit, or\nthe risk profile of those reporting units,\nwhich could impact whether the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than carrying value.\n\n86 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from October 1, 2024 to\nDecember 31, 2024, including macroeconomic and\nmarket factors, industry and banking sector\nevents, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nOctober 1, 2024 quantitative valuations, and\nthe sensitivity of the October 1, 2024\nquantitative results to changes in assumptions\nas of December 31, 2024. Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of December\n31, 2024.\n\nPrior to the January 1, 2024 realignment of\ncertain business activities described above,\nthe Company also performed quantitative\ngoodwill impairment analyses for its former\nCB&W and C&CB reporting units as of October 1,\n2023. Based on the results of the prior year\nimpairment analyses, the Company concluded as\nof October 1, 2023 that the carrying values of\nthe former CB&W and C&CB reporting units\nexceeded their respective fair values, which\nresulted in a non-cash, non-tax-deductible\ngoodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. This prior\nyear goodwill impairment charge was primarily\ndue to the continued impact of higher interest\nrates and discount rates on the former CB&W\nand C&CB reporting units, and a sustained\ndecline in the banking industry share prices,\nincluding Truist\u2019s through the October 1, 2023\ndate of the prior year quantitative analyses.\n\nFor additional goodwill information, refer to\n\u201cNote 1.

In\nestimating the net amount due to or to be\nreceived from tax jurisdictions either\ncurrently or in the future, the Company\nassesses the appropriate tax treatment of\ntransactions and filing positions after\nconsidering statutes, regulations, judicial\nprecedent, and other pertinent information.\nThe income tax laws are complex and subject to\ndifferent interpretations by the taxpayer and\nthe relevant government taxing authorities.\nSignificant judgment is required in\ndetermining the tax accruals and in evaluating\nthe Company\u2019s tax positions, including\nevaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in\nthe estimate of accrued taxes occur\nperiodically due to changes in tax rates,\ninterpretations of tax laws and new judicial\nguidance, the status of examinations by the\ntax authorities, and newly enacted statutory\nand regulatory guidance that could impact the\nrelative merits and risks of tax positions.\nThese changes, when they occur, impact tax\nexpense and can materially affect operating\nresults. Truist reviews tax positions\nquarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new\ninformation becomes available.\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts\navailable to reduce income taxes payable in\nfuture years. Such assets arise due to\ntemporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities, as well as from NOL and tax\ncredit carryforwards. The Company regularly\nevaluates the ability to realize DTAs,\nrecognizing a valuation allowance if, based on\nthe weight of available evidence, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe DTA will not be realized. In determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is necessary,\nthe Company considers the level of taxable\nincome in prior years to the extent that\ncarrybacks are permitted under current tax\nlaws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax\nand taxable income and tax planning strategies\nthat would, if necessary, be implemented.\nTruist currently maintains a valuation\nallowance for certain state carryforwards.

The discount rate\nassumption used to measure the postretirement\nbenefit obligations is set by reference to an\nAA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and\nthe individual characteristics of the plans\nsuch as projected cash flow patterns and\npayment durations.\n\nManagement also considered the sensitivity\nthat changes in the expected return on plan\nassets and the discount rate would have on\npension expense. For the Company\u2019s qualified\nplans, a decrease of 50 basis points in the\ndiscount rate would result in additional\npension expense of approximately $20 million\nfor 2025, while a decrease of 50 basis points\nin the expected return on plan assets would\nresult in an increase of approximately $73\nmillion in pension expense for 2025. This\nestimate reflects the sensitivity of certain\nfactors considered in calculation of pension\nexpense but does not consider all factors that\ncould increase or decrease estimates\ncalculated.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 15.

A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\n88 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matter communicated below\nis a matter arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter\nor on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Certain\nCommercial, Consumer, and Credit Card\nPortfolios\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit losses (ACL)\nrepresents management\u2019s best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated ACL balance was\n$5.2 billion as of December 31, 2024,\nincluding $2.2 billion for commercial\nportfolios, $2.2 billion for consumer\nportfolios, and $0.4 billion for credit card.\nAs disclosed by management, estimates of\nexpected future loan and lease losses are\ndetermined by using statistical models and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. The ACL estimation\nprocess includes both quantitatively\ncalculated components as well as qualitative\ncomponents. Quantitative models are designed\nto forecast probability of default, exposure\nat default, and loss given default by\ncorrelating certain macroeconomic forecast\ndata to historical experience. The models are\ngenerally applied to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic forecast data used in the\nquantitative models is based on forecasted\nvariables for a reasonable and supportable\nperiod. The qualitative components of the ACL\nincorporate management\u2019s judgment in\ndetermining qualitative adjustments where\nmodel outputs are inconsistent with\nmanagement\u2019s expectations with respect to\nexpected credit losses. The qualitative\ncomponents are used to adjust for limitations\nin modeled results related to current economic\nconditions, and considerations with respect to\nthe impact of current and expected events or\nrisks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and\nmay not be completely considered by\nquantitative models.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the ACL for certain commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment by management in determining the\nquantitative model results and certain\nqualitative adjustments; (ii) a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating audit\nevidence related to the quantitative model\nresults and certain qualitative adjustments;\nand (iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the Company\u2019s ACL\nestimation process for certain commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios, which\nincluded controls related to the quantitative\nmodel results and certain qualitative\nadjustments. These procedures also included,\namong others, testing management\u2019s process for\ndetermining the ACL for certain commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card portfolios\nquantitative model results and certain\nqualitative adjustments, which included\nevaluating the appropriateness of the\nquantitative models and management\u2019s\nmethodology, testing the completeness and\naccuracy of the underlying data used in\ndetermining the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, and\nevaluating the reasonableness of judgments\nused by management in determining certain\nqualitative adjustments. Professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge were used to\nassist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness\nof the quantitative models and (ii) the\nreasonableness of judgments used by management\nin determining certain qualitative\nadjustments.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor

Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nTruist Financial Corporation is a purpose-\ndriven financial services company committed to\ninspiring and building better lives and\ncommunities. Headquartered in Charlotte, North\nCarolina, Truist has leading market share in\nmany of the high-growth markets in the U.S.\nand offers a wide range of products and\nservices through wholesale and consumer\nbusinesses, including consumer and small\nbusiness banking, commercial and corporate\nbanking, investment banking and capital\nmarkets, wealth management, payments, and\nspecialized lending businesses.\n\nTruist Bank, the largest subsidiary of Truist\nFinancial Corporation, was chartered in 1872\nand is the oldest bank headquartered in North\nCarolina. Truist Bank is one of the 10 largest\ncommercial banks in the U.S. and provides\nbanking and trust services for clients through\n1,928 offices as of December 31, 2024 and its\ndigital platform.\n\nTruist\u2019s segments were realigned in 2024 with\nthe Company operating and measuring business\nactivity across two business segments:\nConsumer and Small Business Banking and\nWholesale Banking. TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. During 2024, the\nCompany entered into an agreement and\ncompleted the sale of TIH. As the operations\nof TIH are now included in discontinued\noperations, the Company no longer presents the\nIH segment as one of its reportable segments.\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nbusiness segments and their realignment, see\n\u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d and \u201cNote\n21. Operating Segments.\u201d\n\nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. The accounting and reporting policies\nare in accordance with GAAP and conform to the\nguidelines prescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The following is a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Truist Financial Corporation\nand those subsidiaries that are wholly or\nmajority owned by Truist or over which Truist\nhas a controlling financial interest.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are\neliminated in consolidation. The results of\noperations of companies and net assets\nacquired are included from the date of\nacquisition. Results of operations associated\nwith entities or net assets sold are included\nthrough the date of disposition.\nTruist holds investments in certain legal\nentities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are\nlegal entities in which equity investors do\nnot have sufficient equity at risk for the\nentity to independently finance its\nactivities, or as a group, the holders of the\nequity investment at risk lack the power\nthrough voting or similar rights to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nor do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the entity or the right to\nreceive expected residual returns of the\nentity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if\na reporting entity is the primary beneficiary\nof the VIE.\nInvestments in VIEs are evaluated to determine\nif Truist is the primary beneficiary. This\nevaluation gives appropriate consideration to\nthe design of the entity and the variability\nthat the entity was designed to create and\npass along, the relative power of each party,\nand to Truist\u2019s obligation to absorb losses or\nreceive residual returns of the entity. For\nchanges in facts and circumstances, Truist re-\nassesses whether or not it is a primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE. Truist has variable\ninterests in certain entities that are not\nrequired to be consolidated. Refer to \u201cNote\n16. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d for\nadditional disclosures regarding Truist\u2019s\nVIEs.\nInvestments in entities for which the Company\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not control, over operating and\nfinancing decisions are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in Other assets in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost,\nadjusted to reflect the Company\u2019s portion of\nincome, loss, or dividends of the investee.\nTruist records its portion of income or loss\nin Other noninterest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. These\ninvestments are periodically evaluated for\nimpairment.\nThe Company reports any noncontrolling\ninterests in its subsidiaries in the equity\nsection of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nseparately presents the income or loss\nattributable to the noncontrolling interest of\na consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 95\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities\nas held for sale when management, having the\nauthority to approve the action, commits to a\nplan to sell the disposal group, the sale is\nprobable to occur within one year, and the\ndisposal group is available for immediate sale\nin its present condition. The Company also\nconsiders whether an active program to locate\na buyer has been initiated, whether the\ndisposal group is marketed actively for sale\nat a price that is reasonable in relation to\nits current fair value, and whether actions\nrequired to complete the plan indicate it is\nunlikely significant changes to the plan will\nbe made or the plan will be withdrawn. An\nasset or business that meets the criteria for\nheld for sale classification is reported as\ndiscontinued operations when the disposal\nrepresents a strategic shift that has had or\nwill have a major effect on the Company\u2019s\noperating results.\nAssets and liabilities of discontinued\noperations are presented separately in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets for prior periods\ncommencing in the period in which the asset or\nbusiness meets all of the held for sale\ncriteria described above. Net income from\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, is\nseparately reported in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income for current and prior\nperiods commencing in the period in which the\nasset or business meets all of the held for\nsale criteria described above, including any\ngain or loss recognized on the sale or\nadjustment of the carrying amount to fair\nvalue less cost to sell.\nCertain activity of TIH impacting the\nCompany\u2019s footnote disclosures has been\nremoved or revised. The footnote disclosures\nincluded herein are presented on a continuing\noperations basis, unless otherwise noted.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information.\nReclassifications\nIn addition to the reclassifications discussed\nabove in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,\nConsolidated Statements of Income, and certain\nfootnotes for discontinued operations and the\nsegment realignment, as applicable, certain\nother amounts reported in prior periods\u2019\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the current\npresentation.\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. The segment disclosures\nhave been revised to reflect the new\nstructure. Refer to \u201cNote 21. Operating\nSegments\u201d for additional information.\nEffective October 1, 2024, the Company\u2019s\ncorporate expense allocation methodology was\nenhanced to allocate certain overhead or\nfunctional expenses based on actual OT&C\nnoninterest expense performance. Prior period\nresults have been revised for the CSBB, WB,\nand OT&C segments to conform to the current\nallocation methodology. As a result of the\nmethodology change, CSBB noninterest expense\nincreased $ 267million and $ 639million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, with an off-setting decrease in\nOT&C noninterest expense. For the same reason,\nWB noninterest expense increased $ 325million\nand $ 101million for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with an off-\nsetting decrease in OT&C noninterest expense.\nEffective December 31, 2024, the Company\nreclassified its presentation in the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows to\nseparate loan and lease portfolio purchases\nand sales from other loan and lease activity\nwithin investing activities for all periods\npresented.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, trading assets and liabilities, and\nderivative assets and liabilities; goodwill\nand other intangible assets; income taxes; and\npension and postretirement benefit\nobligations.\nBusiness Combinations\nTruist accounts for business combinations\nusing the acquisition method. The accounts of\nan acquired entity are included as of the date\nof acquisition, and any excess of purchase\nprice over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is recorded as goodwill.\n96 Truist Financial Corporation\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due\nfrom banks and interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks that have original maturities of three\nmonths or less. Accordingly, the carrying\namount of such instruments is considered a\nreasonable estimate of fair value. Restricted\ncash was immaterial at December 31, 2024 and\n2023.\nSecurities Financing Activities\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell are accounted for as\ncollateralized financing transactions and are\nrecorded at the amounts at which the\nsecurities were borrowed or purchased. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and related counterparty agree on the\namount of collateral required to secure the\nprincipal amount loaned under these\nagreements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements.\nShort-term borrowings include securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, which are\naccounted for as collateralized financing\ntransactions and are recorded at the amounts\nat which the securities were sold. The Company\nmonitors collateral values daily and pledges\ncollateral as warranted under the respective\nagreements.\nTrading Activities\nVarious trading assets and liabilities are\nused to accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of the Company\u2019s\nclients. Product offerings to clients include\ndebt securities, loans traded in the secondary\nmarket, equity securities, derivative\ncontracts, and other similar financial\ninstruments. The Company elects to apply fair\nvalue accounting to trading loans. Trading\nloans include: (i) loans held in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans\nguaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii)\nloans made or acquired in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS business. Other trading-related\nactivities include acting as a market maker\nfor certain debt and equity security\ntransactions, derivative instrument\ntransactions, and foreign exchange\ntransactions. Trading assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recognized within Noninterest\nincome in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Interest income on\ntrading account securities is included in\nInterest on other earning assets. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\ntrading activities, see \u201cNote 16. Commitments\nand Contingencies\u201d and \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance.\nInvestments in debt securities that are not\nheld for trading purposes are classified as\nHTM or AFS.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nDebt securities are classified as HTM when\nTruist has both the intent and ability to hold\nthe securities to maturity. HTM securities are\nreported at amortized cost. AFS securities are\nreported at estimated fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI,\nnet of deferred income taxes, in the\nShareholders\u2019 equity section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses\nrealized from the sale of AFS securities are\ndetermined by specific identification and are\nincluded in noninterest income.\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit related losses are measured on\nan individual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, are highly rated by rating\nagencies, and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. When applicable, Truist utilizes cash\nflow modeling for the evaluation of potential\ncredit impairment on non-agency securities in\nan unrealized loss position. Cash flow\nmodeling incorporates a variety of factors\nthat impact the long-term expectation of\ncollateral performance. Impairment is\nattributable to factors other than credit when\nthere continues to be an expectation of the\ncollection of all contractual principal and\ninterest.\nRelated to any unrealized losses reported in\nAOCI, Truist considers any intent to sell and\nwhether it was more-likely-than-not that the\nCompany would be required to sell those\nsecurities before the anticipated recovery of\nthe amortized cost basis as of the reporting\ndate.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 97\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities that are not classified as\ntrading assets or liabilities are recorded in\nOther assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered\nmarketable and measured at fair value, with\nchanges in the fair value recognized in Other\nnoninterest income in the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Marketable\nequity securities include mutual fund\ninvestments and other publicly traded equity\nsecurities. Dividends received from marketable\nequity securities and FHLB stock are\nrecognized in Interest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity\nsecurities that are not accounted for under\nthe equity method and that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered non-\nmarketable and are accounted for at cost minus\nimpairment, if any, plus or minus changes\nresulting from observable price changes in\norderly transactions for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same issuer. Any\nadjustments to the carrying value of these\nnon-marketable equity securities are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNon-marketable equity securities include FHLB\nstock and other equity investments. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities, see \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nLHFS\nLHFS includes primarily residential mortgage\nand commercial mortgage loans that management\nintends to sell in the secondary market and\nother loans that management has an active plan\nto sell. LHFS also includes specifically\nidentified loans where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nThe Company elects to apply fair value\naccounting to residential and commercial\nmortgage loans that are originated with the\nintent to be sold in the secondary market.\nDirect loan origination fees associated with\nthese loans are recorded as Mortgage banking\nincome. The majority of direct origination\ncosts are recorded in Personnel expense. The\nfair value of these loans is derived from\nobservable current market prices when\navailable and includes loan servicing value.\nWhen observable market prices are not\navailable, the Company uses judgment and\nestimates fair value using internal models\nthat reflect assumptions consistent with those\nthat would be used by a market participant in\nestimating fair value.\nFirst lien residential mortgage LHFS are\ntransferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE\nsecuritization transactions, whereby the loans\nare exchanged for cash or securities that are\nreadily redeemable for cash with servicing\nrights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale\nof residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at\ninception of the associated interest rate lock\ncommitments and reflect the change in value of\nthe loans resulting from changes in interest\nrates from the time the Company enters into\ninterest rate lock commitments with borrowers\nuntil the loans are sold, adjusted for pull\nthrough rates and excluding hedge transactions\ninitiated to mitigate this market risk.\nCommercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and\nFHLMC. The Company also issues and sells GNMA\ncommercial MBS backed by FHA insured loans.\nThe loans and securities are exchanged for\ncash with servicing rights retained. Gains and\nlosses on sales of residential and commercial\nmortgages are included in Mortgage banking\nincome and gains/losses on sales of other\nconsumer loans are included in Other income.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may\ntransfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At\nthe time of transfer, the loans are recorded\nat LOCOM and charge-offs are recorded at the\ntransfer date, as necessary. Subsequent to the\ninitial transfer to LHFS, these assets are\nrevalued at each subsequent reporting date,\nand any resulting adjustments are reported as\nchanges to a valuation allowance, which is\nrecorded in Noninterest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s LHFS,\nsee \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures.\u201d\nSpecifically identified LHFS, where management\nhas committed to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale, are\nrecorded at LOCOM. Origination fees and costs\nfor such loans are capitalized in the basis of\nthe loan and are included in the calculation\nof realized gains/losses upon sale.\nAdjustments to reflect unrealized losses\nresulting from changes in fair value and\nrealized gains/losses upon ultimate sale of\nthe loans are classified as Noninterest income\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. The\nfair value of these loans is estimated using\nobservable market prices when available, but\nmay also incorporate consideration of other\nunobservable inputs such as indicative bids,\nbroker price opinions, or other information\nderived from internal or external data\nsources.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company\u2019s accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased and, if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that, at the date of acquisition, there\nis more than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\nUnearned income, discounts, and net deferred\nloan fees and costs include direct costs\nassociated with loan origination as well as\npremiums and discounts from origination or\npurchase, which are deferred and amortized\nover the respective loan terms.\n98 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nOriginated Loans and Leases\n\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture, or until maturity or payoff, are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing loans\nor straight-line method for loans with\ninterest-only repayment terms or revolving\nprivileges.\n\nPurchased Loans\n\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date. Purchased loans\nare evaluated upon acquisition and classified\nas either PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality including risk grades, delinquency,\nnonperforming status, previous reportable loan\nmodifications, bankruptcies, and other\nqualitative factors that indicate\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination.\n\nFair values for purchased loans in a business\ncombination are based on a discounted cash\nflow methodology that considers credit loss\nexpectations, market interest rates, and other\nmarket factors such as liquidity from the\nperspective of a market participant. Other\nacquired loans are recorded at the purchase\nprice with premiums or discounts amortized\nover the contractual life of the loan. Loans\nare grouped together according to similar\ncharacteristics and treated in the aggregate\nwhen applying various valuation techniques.\nThe probability of default, loss given default\nand prepayment assumptions are the key factors\ndriving credit loss estimates, which are\nembedded into the estimated cash flows. These\nassumptions are informed by comparable\ninternal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\n\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\n\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans are amortized or accreted to Interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\nloans with interest-only repayment terms or\nrevolving privileges. In the event of\nprepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums\nare recognized in Interest and fees on loans\nand leases.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 99\nLoan Modifications\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Company enters\ninto agreements to modify the terms of loans\nto borrowers that are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The scope of these loan\nmodifications varies from portfolio to\nportfolio but generally falls into one of the\nfollowing categories:\n\n\u2022 Renewals: represent the renewal of a loan\nwhere the Company has concluded that the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulty.\nCommercial renewals result in an extension of\nthe maturity date of the loan (or in some\ncases a contraction of the loan term), and\nother significant terms of the loan (e.g.,\ninterest rate, collateral, guarantor support,\netc.) are re-evaluated in connection with the\nrenewal event.\n\n\u2022 Term extensions: represent an adjustment to\nthe maturity date of the loan that typically\nresults in a reduction to the borrower\u2019s\nscheduled payment over the remainder of the\nloan.\n\n\u2022 Interest rate adjustments: represent a\nreduction in the contractual interest rate on\nthe obligation.\n\n\u2022 Capitalizations: represents the\ncapitalization of forborne loan payments\nand/or other amounts advanced on behalf of the\nborrower into the principal balance of a\nresidential mortgage loan.\n\n\u2022 Payment delays: provide the borrower with a\ntemporary postponement of loan payments that\nis considered other-than-insignificant, which\nhas been defined as a payment delay that\nexceeds 90 days, or three payment cycles, over\na rolling 12-month period. These postponed\nloan payments may result in an extension of\nthe ultimate maturity date of the loan or may\nbe capitalized into the principal balance of\nthe loan in certain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Combinations: in certain circumstances more\nthan one type of a modification is provided to\na borrower (e.g., interest rate reduction and\nterm extension).\n\n\u2022 Other: represents other types of loan\nmodifications that are not considered\nsignificant for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe Company has identified borrowers that are\nincluded in the Loan Modifications disclosures\nin \u201cNote 5. Loans and ACL\u201d as follows:\n\n\u2022 Commercial: the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of loans to commercial borrowers\nthat are rated substandard or worse and\nincludes the modifications in its disclosure\nto the extent that the modification is\nconsidered other-than-insignificant.\n\n\u2022 Consumer and credit card: loan modifications\nto consumer and credit card borrowers are\ngenerally limited to borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty. As a\nresult, the Company evaluates all\nmodifications of consumer and credit card\nloans and includes them in the disclosure to\nthe extent that they are considered other-\nthan-insignificant.\n\nTDRs\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, modifications to a\nborrower\u2019s debt agreement were considered TDRs\nif a concession was granted for economic or\nlegal reasons related to a borrower\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties that otherwise would\nnot be considered. TDRs were undertaken to\nimprove the likelihood of recovery on the loan\nand took the form of modifications that result\nin the stated interest rate of the loan being\nlower than the current market rate for new\ndebt with similar risk, other modifications to\nthe structure of the loan that fall outside of\nnormal underwriting policies and procedures,\nor in certain limited circumstances,\nforgiveness of principal or interest. A\nrestructuring that results in only a delay in\npayments that is insignificant was not\nconsidered an economic concession.\n\nTDRs were classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower was able\nto repay the loan based on the modified terms.\nIn circumstances where the TDR involved\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classified these TDRs as nonperforming.\n\nThe decision to maintain commercial TDRs on\nperforming status was based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrowers\u2019\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation included consideration of the\nborrower\u2019s capacity to pay, which among other\nthings may include a review of the borrower\u2019s\ncurrent financial statements, an analysis of\ncash flow available to pay debt obligations,\nand an evaluation of secondary sources of\npayment from the borrower and any guarantors.\nIt also included an evaluation of the\nborrower\u2019s willingness to pay, which could\ninclude a review of past payment history, an\nevaluation of the borrower\u2019s willingness to\nprovide information on a timely basis, and\nconsideration of offers from the borrower to\nprovide additional collateral or guarantor\nsupport. The credit evaluation could also\ninclude review of cash flow projections,\nconsideration of the adequacy of collateral to\ncover all principal and interest, and trends\nindicating improving profitability and\ncollectability of receivables.\n\nThe evaluation of mortgage and other consumer\nloans included an evaluation of the client\u2019s\ndebt-to-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue and certain other client-specific\nfactors that impact the clients\u2019 ability to\nmake timely principal and interest payments on\nthe loan.\n\n100 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNPAs\n\nNPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property.\nForeclosed property consists of real estate\nand other assets acquired as a result of\nclients\u2019 loan defaults. Truist\u2019s policies for\nplacing loans on nonperforming status conform\nto guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory\nauthorities. Truist classifies loans and\nleases as past due when the payment of\nprincipal and interest based upon contractual\nterms is greater than 30days delinquent or if\none payment is past due. The following table\nsummarizes the delinquency thresholds that are\na factor used in evaluating nonperforming\nclassification and the timing of charge-off\nevaluations:\n                                              \n  \u2026    P\u2026                   E\u2026                \n  \u2026    on                   f\u2026                \n  \u2026    N\u2026                   C\u2026                \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90                   \u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Loans may be returned to performing status\nwhen (i) the borrower has resumed paying the\nfull amount of the scheduled contractual\ninterest and principal payments, (ii)\nmanagement concludes that all principal and\ninterest amounts contractually due (including\narrearages) are reasonably assured of\nrepayment, and (iii) there is a sustained\nperiod of repayment performance, generally a\nminimum of six months.\n\n(2) The timing of nonperforming and charge-off\nevaluations are accelerated in circumstances\nwhere the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.\n\n(3) Or when it is probable that principal or\ninterest is not fully collectible, whichever\noccurs first.\n\n(4) Depends on product type, loss mitigation\nstatus, status of the government guaranty, if\napplicable, and certain other product-specific\nfactors.\n\n(5) Student loans are not placed in\nnonperforming status, which reflects\nconsideration of governmental guarantees or\naccelerated charge-off policies related to\ncertain non-guaranteed portfolios.\n\n(6) Government guaranteed loans are considered\nto be in default once they reach 270 days past\ndue and claims are generally filed once the\nloans reach 365 days past due. The non-\nguaranteed balance, which ranges from 2-3%, is\ncharged off once the claim proceeds related to\nthe guaranteed portion have been received,\nwhich typically occurs no later than 365 days\npast due.\n\n(7) Credit cards are generally not placed on\nnonperforming status, but are fully charged\noff at specified delinquency dates consistent\nwith regulatory guidelines.\n\nWhen commercial loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, management evaluates\nwhether a charge-off must be recorded. For\ncollateral-dependent loans, this evaluation is\nbased on a comparison of the loan\u2019s carrying\nvalue to the value of the related collateral,\nwhile for non-collateral dependent loans, this\nevaluation reflects management\u2019s conclusions\nwith regard to whether any portion of the loan\nis considered uncollectible. Consumer and\ncredit card loans are subject to charge-off at\na specified delinquency date consistent with\nregulatory guidelines.\n\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\n\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus.\n\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value, less\nestimated cost to sell, and subsequently\ncarried at LOCOM. Net realizable value equals\nfair value less estimated selling costs. Any\nexcess of cost over net realizable value at\nthe time of foreclosure is charged to the\nALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic\nrevaluations of the collateral underlying\nimpaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The\nperiodic revaluations are generally based on\nthe appraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist\u2019s\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that, upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than 12months old;\notherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition of these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \u201cNote 5. Loans and\nACL.\u201d\n              Truist Financial Corporation 101\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management\u2019s best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL represents management\u2019s best estimate\nof\nexpected future credit losses related to its\nloan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet\ndate. The Company\u2019s ALLL estimation process\ngives consideration to relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts. This\nestimation process includes both\nquantitatively calculated components as well\nas qualitative components. Loss estimates are\ninformed by historical loss experience that\nincludes losses incurred on loans that were\npreviously modified by the Company. As a\nresult, the Company has concluded that aside\nfrom the limited circumstances where principal\nforgiveness is granted to a borrower, the\nfinancial effect of loan modifications is\nalready inherently included in the ALLL.\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off are incorporated into the ALLL\nestimate, with such amounts capped at the\naggregate of amounts previously charged off.\nChanges to the ACL are made by charges to the\nProvision for credit losses, which is\nreflected in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The RUFC is recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments: commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card. The expected credit\nloss models are generally developed one level\nbelow the portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans and leases are further\ndisaggregated by similar risk characteristics,\nsuch as business sector, client type, funding\ntype, and type of collateral. Larger loans and\nleases that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics or that are considered\ncollateral-dependent, are individually\nevaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is\ndetermined through review of data specific to\nthe borrower and related collateral, if any.\nSuch estimates may be based on current loss\nforecasts, an evaluation of the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral or, in certain\ncircumstances, the present value of expected\ncash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s effective\ninterest rate as described further below.\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic forecast data,\nportfolio composition and loan attributes as\nthe primary inputs. Loss estimates are\ninformed by historical loss experience\nadjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and\ncurrent and expected portfolio risk\ncharacteristics. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough the contractual maturity of the loan\nunless the borrower has a right to renew that\nis not cancellable. In circumstances where an\nobligation is in a default state, the best\nestimate of the expected loss at the balance\nsheet date may be based on modeled losses that\noccur after the contractual maturity date of\nthe obligation. Prior to January 1, 2023, the\nloss forecasting models captured losses after\nthe maturity date of the loan for loans that\nwere reasonably expected to be modified as a\nTDR.\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for Company-sanctioned\nmacroeconomic forecast data, including the\nmacroeconomic forecast data for use in the ACL\nprocess. Forecasted economic conditions are\ndeveloped using third-party macroeconomic\nforecast data across scenarios adjusted based\non management\u2019s expectations over a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of two years.\nAssumptions revert to long term historic\naverages gradually over a one-year period.\nMacroeconomic forecast data used in estimating\nthe expected losses vary by loan portfolio and\ninclude employment factors, estimated\ncollateral values, and market indicators as\ndescribed by portfolio segment below.\nThe qualitative components of the ALLL\nestimation process incorporate management\njudgement in determining qualitative\nadjustments for circumstances where the model\noutput is inconsistent with management\u2019s\nexpectations with respect to expected credit\nlosses. The qualitative components are used to\nadjust for limitations in modeled results\nrelated to the current economic conditions and\nconsiderations with respect to the impact of\ncurrent and expected events or risks, the\noutcomes of which are uncertain and may not be\ncompletely considered by quantitative models.\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies, and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n102 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower\u2019s ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers\u2019 financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan\u2019s guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is reasonably\nassured. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management\u2019s   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting systems of models\nuse macroeconomic forecast data across\nscenarios and current portfolio attributes as\ninputs. The models forecast probability of\ndefault, exposure at default and loss given\ndefault by correlating certain macroeconomic\nforecast data to historical experience. Common\nmacroeconomic drivers for the commercial\nportfolios include unemployment trends, U.S.\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, and\nproperty values.\n\nTruist\u2019s policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all lending\nrelationships where non-performing exposure\nexceeds $ 5million. Prior to January 1, 2023,\nTruist included TDRs, whether performing or\nnon-performing, to the extent that they\nexceeded $ 5million. Subsequent to December\n31, 2022, Truist only includes non-performing\nloans greater than $ 5million or more, as such\nlending relationships do not typically share\nsimilar risk characteristics with others.\nIndividually evaluated reserves are based on\ncurrent forecasts, the present value of\nexpected cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s\neffective interest rate, or the value of\ncollateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories, and other types of collateral.\n\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe ALLL related to the consumer and credit\ncard lending portfolios is generally\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness, and sales channel. Consumer\nportfolio models use macroeconomic forecast\ndata across scenarios and current portfolio\nattributes as inputs. The models forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic forecast data to historical\nexperience. Common macroeconomic drivers for\nthe consumer portfolios include unemployment\ntrends, home price indices, and used car\nprices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and other\nconsumer portfolios include secured indirect\ninstallment loans to consumers for the\npurchase of new and used automobiles, boats\nand recreational vehicles. The student loan\nportfolio was composed of government\nguaranteed student loans and certain private\nstudent loans. The government guarantee\nmitigated substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. The\ncredit card portfolio and certain other\nconsumer payment solution businesses within\nthe other consumer portfolios are generally\nunsecured and are actively managed.\n\nTruist uses delinquency status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 103\nPrior to January 1, 2023 the ALLL for loans\nclassified as a TDR was based on analyses\ncapturing the expected credit losses and the\nimpact of the concessions over the remaining\nlife of the assets.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises, equipment, finance leases, and\nleasehold improvements are stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed\nprimarily using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the related\nassets and are recorded within the\ncorresponding Noninterest expense categories\non the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the\nimprovements\u2019 estimated useful lives or the\nlease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived\nasset or asset group, including premises and\nequipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of a long-\nlived asset exceeds its fair value.\nLessee operating and finance leases\nTruist has operating and finance leases for\ndata centers, corporate offices, branches,\nretail centers, and certain equipment.\nOperating leases with an original lease term\nin excess of one year are included in Other\nassets and Other liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases\nare included in Premises and equipment and\nLong-term debt in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term. Lease\nliabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating and finance lease assets and\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement\ndate based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. Operating lease\ncosts are recorded in Net occupancy expense or\nEquipment expense based on the underlying\nasset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate\nin determining the present value of lease\npayments when readily determinable, and a\ncollateralized incremental borrowing rate when\nan implicit rate is not available. Lease terms\nconsider options to extend or terminate based\non the determination of whether such renewal\nor termination options are deemed reasonably\ncertain.\nLease agreements that contain non-lease\ncomponents are generally accounted for as a\nsingle lease component. Variable costs, such\nas maintenance expenses, property and sales\ntaxes, association dues and index-based rate\nincreases, are expensed as they are incurred.\nThe impairment policy for a ROU asset is\ndiscussed within the Premises and Equipment\nsection above.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nLife insurance policies on certain current and\nformer directors, officers and teammates, for\nwhich Truist is the owner and beneficiary are\nstated at the cash surrender value within\nOther assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Changes in cash surrender value and\nproceeds from insurance benefits are recorded\nin Other income in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. These policies provide the Company\nan efficient form of funding for retirement\nand other employee benefits costs. See \u201cNote\n9. Other Assets and Liabilities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified tax credit investments. In\ncomputing the provision for income taxes, the\nCompany evaluates the technical merits of its\nincome tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The proportional amortization method\nof accounting is used on affordable housing\nand other qualified tax credit investments,\nsuch that the initial cost of the investment\ngiving rise to tax credits is amortized in\nproportion to the allocation of tax credits\nand other income tax benefits in each period\nas a component of the provision for income\ntaxes. Truist includes the initial investment\ncash flows and subsequent credits within\noperating activities in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Additionally, the\nCompany recognizes all excess tax benefits and\ndeficiencies on employee share-based payments\nas a component of the Provision for income\ntaxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. These tax effects, generally\ndetermined upon the exercise of stock options\nor vesting of equity compensation awards, are\ntreated as discrete items in the period in\nwhich they occur. For additional information\nrelated to the Company\u2019s unrealized gains and\nlosses, see \u201cNote 13. AOCI.\u201d\nDTAs and DTLs result from differences between\nthe timing of the recognition of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes\nand for income tax purposes. These deferred\nassets and liabilities are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected\nto apply in the periods in which the DTAs or\nDTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent\nchanges in the tax laws require adjustment to\nthese deferred assets and liabilities with the\ncumulative effect included in the Provision\nfor income taxes for the period in which the\nchange is enacted. A valuation allowance is\nrecognized for a DTA if, based on the weight\nof available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that some portion or all of the DTA will\nnot be realized.\n104 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInterest and penalties related to the\nCompany\u2019s tax positions are recognized in the\nProvision for income taxes in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s activities\nrelated to income taxes, see \u201cNote 14. Income\nTaxes.\u201d\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nTruist enters into derivative contracts to\nmanage various financial risks. A derivative\nis a financial instrument that derives its\ncash flows, and therefore its value, by\nreference to an underlying instrument, index,\nor referenced interest rate. Derivative\ncontracts are carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with the fair\nvalue representing the net present value of\nexpected future cash receipts or payments\nbased on the underlying instruments, indexes,\nor referenced interest rate.\nThe Company records derivative contracts at\nfair value in Other assets and Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends upon whether or\nnot it has been designated in a formal,\nqualifying hedging relationship. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives not designated\nin a hedging relationship are recognized\nwithin Noninterest income or Personnel expense\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. This\nincludes derivatives that the Company enters\ninto in a dealer capacity to facilitate client\ntransactions and as a risk management tool to\neconomically hedge certain identified risks\nassociated with assets carried at fair value\nsuch as MSRs, along with certain interest rate\nlock commitments on residential mortgage and\ncommercial loans that are a normal part of the\nCompany\u2019s operations. The Company also\nevaluates its financial contracts to determine\nwhether any embedded derivatives are required\nto be bifurcated and separately accounted for\nas freestanding derivatives.\nCertain derivatives used as risk management\ntools are designated as accounting hedges and\nare used to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates or other identified\nmarket risks. The Company prepares written\nhedge documentation for all derivatives which\nare designated as hedges of (i) changes in the\nfair value of a recognized asset or liability\n(fair value hedge) attributable to a specified\nrisk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as\nthe variability of cash flows to be received\nor paid related to a recognized asset or\nliability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge\ndocumentation includes identification of,\namong other items, the risk management\nobjective, hedging instrument, hedged item,\nand methodologies for assessing and measuring\nhedge effectiveness, along with support for\nmanagement\u2019s assertion that the hedge will be\nhighly effective. Methodologies related to\nhedge effectiveness include (i) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the cash\nflows of the actual derivative and\nhypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the fair\nvalues of the actual derivative and the hedged\nitem.\nFor designated hedging relationships, the\nCompany generally performs subsequent\nassessments of hedge effectiveness using a\nqualitative approach.\nBelow is a summary of the cash flow and fair\nvalue hedge programs utilized by Truist:\n

105\nDerivatives expose the Company to risk that\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract\ndoes not perform as expected. The Company\nmanages its exposures to counterparty credit\nrisk associated with derivatives by entering\ninto transactions with counterparties with\ndefined exposure limits based on their credit\nquality and in accordance with established\npolicies and procedures. All counterparties\nare reviewed regularly as part of the\nCompany\u2019s credit risk management practices and\nappropriate action is taken to adjust the\nexposure limits to certain counterparties as\nnecessary. The Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions are generally governed by ISDA\nagreements or other legally enforceable\nindustry standard master netting agreements.\nIn certain cases and depending on the nature\nof the underlying derivative transactions,\nbilateral collateral agreements are also\nutilized.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject\nto OTC derivative clearing requirements, which\nrequire certain derivatives to be cleared\nthrough central clearing houses. These\nclearing houses require the Company to post\ninitial and variation margin to mitigate the\nrisk of non-payment, the latter of which is\nreceived or paid daily based on the net asset\nor liability of the contracts. The Company\napplies settlement to market treatment for the\ncash collateralizing derivative contracts with\ncertain centrally cleared counterparties.\n\nWhen the Company has more than one outstanding\nderivative transaction with a single\ncounterparty, and there exists a legal right\nof setoff with that counterparty, the Company\nconsiders its exposure to the counterparty to\nbe the net fair value of its derivative\npositions with that counterparty. If the net\nfair value is positive, then the corresponding\nasset value also reflects cash collateral\nheld. The Company offsets derivative\ntransactions with a single counterparty as\nwell as any cash collateral paid to and\nreceived from that counterparty for derivative\ncontracts that are subject to ISDA or other\nlegally enforceable netting arrangements and\nmeet accounting guidance for offsetting\ntreatment.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nderivative activities, see \u201cNote 18. Fair\nValue Disclosures\u201d and \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the\nfair value of net assets acquired (including\nidentifiable intangibles) in transactions\naccounted for as business combinations. Truist\nallocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s)\nthat are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the business combination.\nThe goodwill of each reporting unit is\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis as\nof October 1 or more often if events or\ncircumstances indicate that it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying value. If, after\nassessing all relevant events or\ncircumstances, Truist concludes that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value,\nthen a quantitative impairment test is\nrequired. Truist may also elect to bypass the\nqualitative assessment and proceed directly to\na quantitative impairment test. In the\nquantitative test, the fair value of a\nreporting unit is compared to the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit. If the fair value\nof a reporting unit is greater than the\ncarrying value, then there is no impairment.\nIf the fair value is less than the carrying\nvalue, then an impairment loss is recorded for\nthe amount that the carrying value exceeds the\nfair value, not to exceed the total amount of\ngoodwill assigned to the reporting unit.\nThe quantitative impairment test estimates the\nfair value of the reporting units using the\nincome and market-based approaches. The inputs\nand assumptions specific to each reporting\nunit are incorporated in the valuations,\nincluding projections of future cash flows,\ndiscount rates, and applicable valuation\nmultiples based on the comparable public\ncompany information. The income approach\nutilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of\nmulti-year financial forecasts developed for\neach reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions. The market-based\napproach utilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples, and\nconsiders a market control premium associated\nwith cost synergies and other cash flow\nbenefits that arise from obtaining control\nover a reporting unit, and guideline\ntransactions, when applicable. Truist also\nassesses the reasonableness of the aggregate\nestimated fair value of the reporting units by\ncomparison to its market capitalization over a\nreasonable period of time, including\nconsideration of historic bank control\npremiums and the current market.\nCDI and other intangible assets include\npremiums paid for acquisitions of core\ndeposits and other identifiable intangible\nassets. Intangible assets other than goodwill,\nwhich are determined to have finite lives, are\namortized over their useful lives, based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits received. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nactivities related to goodwill and other\nintangibles, see \u201cNote 7. Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets.\u201d\n106 Truist Financial Corporation\nLoan Servicing Rights\nTruist has three classes of servicing rights\nfor which it separately manages the economic\nrisks: residential MSRs, commercial MSRs, and\nother loan servicing rights. Loan servicing\nrights are accounted for at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in Mortgage\nbanking income and Other income on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. The fair\nvalue of servicing rights is impacted by a\nvariety of factors, including prepayment\nassumptions, discount rates, delinquency\nrates, contractually specified servicing fees,\nservicing costs, and underlying portfolio\ncharacteristics. These risks are hedged with\nvarious derivative instruments that are\nintended to mitigate the income statement\neffect to changes in fair value. The\nunderlying assumptions and estimated values\nare corroborated by values received from\nindependent third parties and comparisons to\nmarket transactions. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s servicing rights,\nsee \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing.\u201d\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Depending on the nature of the asset or\nliability, the Company uses various valuation\ntechniques and assumptions when estimating\nfair value. The Company classifies inputs used\nin valuation techniques within the fair value\nhierarchy discussed in \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nWhen measuring assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue, the Company considers the principal or\nmost advantageous market in which it would\ntransact and considers assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset\nor liability. Assets and liabilities that are\nrequired to be measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis include trading securities,\nderivative instruments, AFS securities, and\ncertain other equity securities. Assets and\nliabilities that the Company has elected to\nmeasure at fair value on a recurring basis\ninclude trading loans, loans originated to be\nsold and classified as LHFS, and loan\nservicing rights. Other assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, such as when assets are evaluated for\nimpairment, and subsequently carried at LOCOM.\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nvaluation of assets and liabilities held at\nfair value, see \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\u201d\nEquity-Based Compensation\nTruist maintains various equity-based\ncompensation plans that provide for the\ngranting of RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs to selected\nteammates and directors. Truist values share-\nbased awards at the grant date fair value and\nrecognizes the expense over the requisite\nservice period taking into account retirement\neligibility. Compensation expense is\nrecognized in Personnel expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures\nare recognized as they occur. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation plans, see \u201cNote 15. Benefit\nPlans.\u201d\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions.\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure\nthe postretirement benefit obligations is set\nby reference to an AA Above Median corporate\nbond yield curve and the individual\ncharacteristics of the plans such as projected\ncash flow patterns and payment durations. The\nexpected long-term rate of return on assets is\nbased on the expected returns for each major\nasset class in which the plan invests,\nadjusted for the weight of each asset class in\nthe target mix. For additional information on\nthe Company\u2019s pension plans and postretirement\nbenefit plans, see \u201cNote 15. Benefit Plans.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCompany recognizes two primary types of\nrevenue in its Consolidated Statements of\nIncome: Interest income and Noninterest\nincome. The Company\u2019s principal source of\nrevenue is Interest income from loans and\nsecurities, which is recognized on an accrual\nbasis using the effective interest method. For\ninformation on the Company\u2019s policies for\nrecognizing Interest income on loans and\nsecurities, see the \u201cLoans and Leases,\u201d\n\u201cLHFS,\u201d \u201cTrading Activities,\u201d and \u201cInvestment\nSecurities\u201d sections within this Note.\nNoninterest income includes revenue from\nvarious types of transactions and services\nprovided to clients. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from contracts with customers as\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nPerformance obligations are typically\nsatisfied in one year or less. Truist elected\nthe practical expedient to expense the\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract when\nincurred when the amortization period is one\nyear or less. As of December 31, 2024 and\n2023, remaining performance obligations\nconsisted primarily of investment banking\nservices for contracts with an original\nexpected length of one year or less.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 107\nTransaction and service-based revenues\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues include\nWealth management income, Investment banking\nincome, Service charges on deposits, and Card\nand payment related fees. Revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time when the\ntransactions occur or over time as services\nare performed primarily over monthly or\nquarterly periods. Payment is typically\nreceived in the period the transactions occur\nor, in some cases, within 90 days of the\nservice period. Fees may be fixed or, where\napplicable, based on a percentage of\ntransaction size or managed assets. These\nrevenues, and their relationship to the\nCompany\u2019s operating segments, are further\ndescribed by type below. Refer to \u201cNote 21.\nOperating Segments\u201d for information on segment\nresults.\n\nWealth management income includes trust and\ninvestment management income, retail\ninvestment and brokerage services, and\ninvestment advisory and other specialty wealth\nmanagement fees. The Company\u2019s execution of\nthese services represents its related\nperformance obligations. The Company generally\nrecognizes trust and investment management and\nadvisory revenue over time as services are\nrendered based on either a percentage of the\nmarket value of the assets under management or\nadvisement, or fixed based on the services\nprovided to the client. Fees are generally\nswept from the client\u2019s account either in\nadvance of or in arrears based on the prior\nperiod\u2019s asset balances under management or\nadvisement. The Company also offers selling\nand distribution services and earns\ncommissions through the sale of annuity and\nmutual fund products, acting as agent in these\ntransactions and recognizing revenue at a\npoint in time when the client enters into an\nagreement with the product carrier. The\nCompany may also receive trailing commissions\nand 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and\nannuity products and recognizes this revenue\nin the period earned. Retail trade execution\ncommissions are earned and recognized on the\ntrade date with payment on the settlement\ndate. Wealth management income is included in\nthe WB operating segment.\n\nInvestment banking and trading income includes\nsecurities underwriting fees, advisory fees,\nloan syndication fees, trade execution\nservices revenue, and structured real estate\nincome. Underwriting fees are earned on the\ntrade date when the Company, as a member of an\nunderwriting syndicate, purchases the\nsecurities from the issuer and sells the\nsecurities to third-party investors. Each\nmember of the syndicate is responsible for\nselling its portion of the underwriting and is\nliable for the proportionate costs of the\nunderwriting; therefore, the Company\u2019s portion\nof underwriting revenue and expense is\npresented gross within noninterest income and\nnoninterest expense. The transaction price is\nbased on a percentage of the total transaction\namount and payments are settled shortly after\nthe trade date. Fees for merger and\nacquisition advisory services, including\nvarious activities such as business valuation,\nidentification of potential targets or\nacquirers, and the issuance of fairness\nopinions, are generally earned and recognized\nby the Company when performance obligations\nare satisfied. The Company\u2019s execution of the\nadvisory services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. The transaction price is based on\ncontractually specified terms agreed upon with\nthe client for each advisory service. Loan\nsyndication fees are typically recognized at\nthe closing of a loan syndication transaction.\nStructured real estate income is recognized\nwhen an existing build-to-suit or sale-\nleaseback asset is sold. The proceeds, net of\nclosing costs, are reduced by the carrying\nvalue of the underlying leased asset. Revenue\nrelated to corporate trade execution services\nis earned and recognized on the trade date\nwith payment on the settlement date.\nInvestment banking and trading income is\nincluded in the WB operating segment.\n\nService charges on deposits include account\nmaintenance, cash and treasury management,\nwire transfers, ATM, overdraft, and other\ndeposit-related fees. The Company\u2019s execution\nof the services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. Each\nof these performance obligations are either\nsatisfied over time or at a point in time as\nthe services are provided to the client. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. Payments for services provided are\neither withdrawn from client accounts as\nservices are rendered or in the billing period\nfollowing the completion of the service. The\ntransaction price for each of these fees is\nbased on the Company\u2019s predetermined fee\nschedules. Service charges on deposits are\nrecognized in the CSBB and WB operating\nsegments.\n\nCard and payment related fees include\ninterchange fees from credit and debit cards,\nmerchant acquirer revenue, and other card\nrelated services. Interchange fees are earned\nby the Company each time a request for payment\nis initiated by a client at a merchant for\nwhich the Company transfers the funds on\nbehalf of the client. Interchange rates are\nset by the payment network and are based on\npurchase volumes and other factors.\nInterchange fees are received daily and\nrecognized at a point in time when the card\ntransaction is processed, which represents the\nCompany\u2019s related performance obligation. The\nCompany is considered an agent of the client\nand incurs costs with the payment network to\nfacilitate the interchange with the merchant;\ntherefore, the related payment network expense\nis recognized as a reduction of card fees.\nTruist also offers rewards and/or rebates to\nits client based on card usage. The costs\nassociated with these programs are recognized\nas a reduction of card fees. Card and payment\nrelated fees are recognized in the CSBB and WB\noperating segments.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is\ncomputed by dividing net income available to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during\neach period, plus common share equivalents\ncalculated for stock options, warrants, and\nrestricted stock outstanding using the\ntreasury stock method, except in a net loss\nwhere diluted EPS is equal to basic. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s EPS,\nsee \u201cNote 20. Computation of EPS.\u201d\n108 Truist Financial Corporation\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company periodically enters into\ntransactions with certain of its executive\nofficers, directors, affiliates, trusts,\nand/or other related parties in its ordinary\ncourse of business. The Company is required to\ndisclose material related party transactions,\nother than certain compensation and other\narrangements entered into in the normal course\nof business.

Discontinued Operations             \n                                              \nOn April 3, 2023, the Company completed its\nsale of a 20% stake of the common equity in\nTIH, which was previously wholly owned by\nTruist, to an investor group led by Stone\nPoint Capital, LLC for $ 1.9billion, with the\nproceeds, net of tax, recognized as an\nincrease to shareholders\u2019 equity. In\nconnection with the transaction, the\nnoncontrolling interest holder received\nprofits interest representing 3.75% coverage\non TIH\u2019s fully diluted equity value at\ntransaction close, and certain consent and\nexit rights commensurate with a noncontrolling\ninvestor. Including these profits interests,\nthe noncontrolling interest holder was\nallocated approximately 23% of TIH pretax net\nincome. Also in conjunction with the same\ntransaction, TIH granted certain event-vested\nprofits interests and appreciation units,\nrepresenting 4.50% coverage on TIH\u2019s fully\ndiluted equity value at grant, to various TIH\nemployees and officers in the second quarter\nof 2023. These awards, subject to continued\nemployment through the applicable event,\nvested upon the change in control of TIH.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group\nled by Stone Point Capital LLC and Clayton,\nDubilier & Rice for a purchase price that\nimplied an enterprise value for TIH of $\n15.5billion. The divestiture of TIH\nrepresented a strategic shift that had a major\neffect on our operations and financial\nresults. The Company reclassified all of the\nassets and liabilities of TIH to discontinued\noperations in connection with the announcement\nof the disposition of the business. As such,\nfinancial information attributed to TIH has\nbeen recast to reflect discontinued operations\nfor the periods presented herein.

Charge-\noffs include $ 98million related to the sale.\nThe commercial ALLL decreased $ 10million, and\nthe consumer and credit card ALLL increased $\n69million in the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe decrease in the commercial ALLL primarily\nreflects a decrease in commercial loan\nbalances that was partially offset by\nincreases in the reserve rates related to the\nCRE and commercial construction portfolios.\nThe change in the consumer and credit card\nALLL was primarily driven by loan growth and\nincreases in reserve rates related to certain\nconsumer non-real estate portfolios, partially\noffset by a decrease in the reserve rate\nrelated to the residential mortgage portfolio.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 119\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include\nunemployment trends, U.S. real GDP, corporate\ncredit spreads, property values, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the December 31, 2024 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2023. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, the\neconomic outlook relative to the prior period\nvaried by economic variable and time period.\nThe economic outlook generally reflected\nmodest improvement in GDP growth and no\nmaterial change in forecasted unemployment\ncompared to the prior quarter. The overall\neconomic forecast shaping the ACL estimate at\nDecember 31, 2024 included GDP growth in the\nlow-single digits and an unemployment rate\nnear the mid-single digits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s judgment related to\nexpected future credit losses, will continue\nto be an important component of the ACL for\nthe foreseeable future. The December 31, 2024\nACL estimate includes adjustments to consider\nthe impact of current and expected events or\nrisks not captured by the loss forecasting\nmodels, the outcomes of which are uncertain\nand may not be completely considered by\nquantitative models.

Goodwill and Other Intangible       \n  Assets                                      \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. During 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement and completed the sale of TIH,\nwhich was the principal legal entity of the IH\nsegment. As the operations of TIH were\nincluded in discontinued operations prior to\nthe sale of TIH, the Company no longer\npresents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments.\n\nFollowing the realignment of these business\nactivities, the Company\u2019s three reporting\nunits with goodwill balances are CSBB, WB\nexcluding Wealth, and Wealth. For segment\nreporting purposes, the Wealth reporting unit\nresides in WB. In conjunction with these\nrealignments, goodwill of $ 1.7billion was\nreassigned from CSBB to Wealth, based on the\nrelative fair value of CSBB and Wealth, and\ngoodwill of $ 220million was reassigned from\nthe WB reporting unit to CSBB based on the\nrelative fair value of the WB reporting unit\nand the realigned small business banking\nclient segmentation. In addition, the Company\ncompleted an assessment of any potential\ngoodwill impairment for all impacted reporting\nunits immediately prior and subsequent to the\nrealignments and determined that no impairment\nexisted. The quantitative valuation of the WB\nreporting unit performed in conjunction with\nthese goodwill realignments indicated that as\nof January 1, 2024, the fair value of the WB\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\nless than 10%, indicating at the time of the\nrealignments that the goodwill of the WB\nreporting unit may be at risk of impairment.\n\nThe Company performed quantitative goodwill\nimpairment analyses for its CSBB, WB and\nWealth reporting units as of October 1, 2024.\nBased on the results of the impairment\nanalyses, the Company concluded that the fair\nvalues of the CSBB, WB and Wealth reporting\nunits exceeded their respective carrying\nvalues; therefore, there was no goodwill\nimpairment. However, for the WB reporting\nunit, the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value by approximately\n10%, indicating that the goodwill of the WB\nreporting unit may remain at risk of\nimpairment. The fair values of the CSBB, WB\nand Wealth reporting units were estimated\nusing the income approach and a market-based\napproach, weighted 50% and 50%, respectively.\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from October 1, 2024 to\nDecember 31, 2024, including macroeconomic and\nmarket factors, industry and banking sector\nevents, Truist specific performance\nindicators, a comparison of management\u2019s\nforecast and assumptions to those used in its\nOctober 1, 2024 quantitative valuations, and\nthe sensitivity of the October 1, 2024\nquantitative results to changes in assumptions\nas of December 31, 2024. Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of December\n31, 2024. Refer to \u201cNote 1. Basis of\nPresentation\u201d for additional information.\n\nPrior to the January 1, 2024 realignment of\ncertain business activities described above,\nthe Company also performed quantitative\ngoodwill impairment analyses for its former\nCB&W and C&CB reporting units as of October 1,\n2023. Based on the results of the prior year\nimpairment analyses, the Company concluded as\nof October 1, 2023 that the carrying values of\nthe former CB&W and C&CB reporting units\nexceeded their respective fair values, which\nresulted in a non-cash, non-tax-deductible\ngoodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. This prior\nyear goodwill impairment charge was primarily\ndue to the continued impact of higher interest\nrates and discount rates on the former CB&W\nand C&CB reporting units, and a sustained\ndecline in the banking industry share prices,\nincluding Truist\u2019s through the October 1, 2023\ndate of the prior year quantitative analyses.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill\nattributable to operating segments are\nreflected in the table below. Activity during\n2024 primarily relates to the segment\nrealignment described above and the\ndivestiture of Sterling Capital Management,\nLLC. Activity during 2023 includes the\naforementioned impairments and the realignment\nof Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation into\nthe C&CB segment from the IH segment. Refer to\n\u201cNote 21.

As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company\u2019s\nfederal income tax returns are no longer\nsubject to assessment by the IRS for taxable\nyears prior to 2021. The IRS is currently\nexamining the Company\u2019s 2022 consolidated\nfederal income tax return. With limited\nexceptions, the Company is no longer subject\nto assessment by state and local taxing\nauthorities for taxable years prior to 2018.\nIt is reasonably possible that the liability\nfor unrecognized tax benefits could decrease\nby as much as $ 35million during the next 12\nmonths due to completion of tax authority\nexaminations and the expiration of statutes of\nlimitations. It is uncertain how much, if any,\nof this potential decrease will impact the\nCompany\u2019s effective tax rate.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 135\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

discontinued\noperations for the qualified defined benefit\npension plan for employees of TIH.\n(2) The 2024 rate represents the beginning of\nthe year assumptions. Following the sale of\nTIH, the weighted average assumed discount\nrate was updated from 5.12% to 5.78%.\n\nThe weighted average expected long-term rate\nof return on plan assets represents the\naverage rate of return expected to be earned\non plan assets over the period the benefits\nincluded in the benefit obligation are to be\npaid. In developing the expected rate of\nreturn, Truist considers long-term compound\nannualized returns of historical market data\nfor each asset category, as well as historical\nactual returns on the plan assets. Using this\nreference information, the Company develops\nforward-looking return expectations for each\nasset category and a weighted average expected\nlong-term rate of return for the plan based on\ntarget asset allocations contained in the\nCompany\u2019s Investment Policy Statement. For\n2025, the expected rate of return on plan\nassets is 6.7%.\n\nFollowing the sale of TIH, Truist retained the\npostretirement benefit obligation for TIH\nemployees and changed the status of TIH\nemployees by eliminating their eligibility to\nearn future service credits. Changes in\npension plan obligations associated with the\ndisposal of operating segments such as TIH\nrequire the remeasurement of postretirement\nbenefit obligations prior to the disposal,\nupdates to pension plan assumptions inherent\nin valuations, and identification and\nrecognition of valuation changes specific to\nthe sale, including the establishment of a new\nperiodic service cost using assumptions as of\nthe remeasurement date. The remeasurement\nprocess of impacted pension plans upon the\ndisposal of TIH included a reduction in\npension benefit obligations of $ 783million\nand a loss on plan assets of $ 834million,\nprimarily driven by an increase in the\nweighted average assumed discount rate from\n5.12% to 5.78%, and a decrease in the value of\nplan assets by $ 508million, primarily driven\nby market prices. The impact of the sale on\nTruist pension plans resulted in a reduction\nof pension benefit obligations by $ 97million\nwhich was recorded as a reduction of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss.

Commitments and Contingencies      \n                                              \nTruist utilizes a variety of financial\ninstruments to mitigate exposure to risks and\nmeet the financing needs and provide\ninvestment opportunities for clients. These\nfinancial instruments include commitments to\nextend credit, letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, derivatives, and other\ninvestments. Truist also has commitments to\nfund certain affordable housing investments\nand contingent liabilities related to certain\nsold loans.\n\nTax Credit and Certain Equity Investments\n\nThe Company invests in certain affordable\nhousing projects throughout its market area as\na means of supporting local communities.\nTruist receives tax credits related to these\ninvestments, for which the Company typically\nacts as a limited partner and therefore does\nnot exert control over the operating or\nfinancial policies of the partnerships. Truist\ntypically provides financing during the\nconstruction and development of the\nproperties; however, permanent financing is\ngenerally obtained from independent third\nparties upon completion of a project. Tax\ncredits are subject to recapture by taxing\nauthorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level.\nTruist\u2019s maximum potential exposure to losses\nrelative to investments in VIEs is generally\nlimited to the sum of the outstanding balance,\nfuture funding commitments and any related\nloans to the entity, exclusive of any\npotential tax recapture associated with the\ninvestments. Loans to these entities are\nunderwritten in substantially the same manner\nas the Company\u2019s other loans and are generally\nsecured.\n\nThe Company invests as a limited partner in\ncertain projects through the New Market Tax\nCredit program, which is a Federal financial\nprogram aimed to stimulate business and real\nestate investment in underserved communities\nvia a Federal tax credit. These tax credits,\nreferred to as \u201cOther qualified tax credits\u201d\nbelow, qualify for the proportional\namortization method. The Company\u2019s Production\nTax Credit investments also qualify for the\nproportional amortization method and are\nincluded in \u201cOther qualified tax credits\u201d\nbelow.\n\nThe Company also invests in entities that\npromote renewable energy sources as a limited\npartner. The Company has determined that these\nrenewable energy tax credit partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these VIEs because\nit does not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIEs\u2019 financial performance and therefore, it\nis not required to consolidate these VIEs. The\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to\nthese investments is limited to its equity\ninvestments in these partnerships and any\nadditional unfunded equity commitments.\n\nTruist has investments in and future funding\ncommitments related to private equity and\ncertain other equity method investments. The\nrisk exposure relating to such commitments is\ngenerally limited to the amount of investments\nand future funding commitments made.\nThe following table summarizes certain tax\ncredit and certain equity investments:\n                                              \n  (Dol\u2026    Balan\u2026          Dec                \n  in       Sheet           31,       Dec 31,  \n  mill\u2026    Locat\u2026         2024          2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Inve\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  affo\u2026                                       \n  hous\u2026                                       \n  proj\u2026                                       \n  and                                         \n  other                                       \n  qual\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  cred\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026    Other     $   7,782    $    6,754  \n  amou\u2026    assets                             \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  futu\u2026                                       \n  fund\u2026    Other                              \n  comm\u2026    liabi\u2026        2,667         2,473  \n  incl\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n           Loans                              \n           and                                \n  Lend\u2026    leases        2,376         1,981  \n  expo\u2026    for                                \n           funded                             \n           amoun\u2026                             \n  Rene\u2026                                       \n  ener\u2026                                       \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026    Other           551           285  \n  amou\u2026    assets                             \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  futu\u2026                                       \n  fund\u2026                                       \n  comm\u2026    NA              702           747  \n  not                                         \n  incl\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n  SBIC                                        \n  and                                         \n  cert\u2026                                       \n  other                                       \n  equi\u2026                                       \n  meth\u2026                                       \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Carr\u2026    Other           878           758  \n  amou\u2026    assets                             \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  futu\u2026                                       \n  fund\u2026                                       \n  comm\u2026    NA              613           589  \n  not                                         \n  incl\u2026                                       \n  in                                          \n  carr\u2026                                       \n  amou\u2026                                       \n                                              \n140 Truist Financial Corporation\nThe following table presents a summary of tax\ncredits and amortization expense associated\nwith the Company\u2019s tax credit investment\nactivity.

Such financial instruments\ninclude commitments to extend credit and\ncertain contractual agreements, including\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantee arrangements.\n\nCommitments to extend, originate, or purchase\ncredit are primarily lines of credit to\nbusinesses and consumers and have specified\nrates and maturity dates. Many of these\ncommitments also have adverse change clauses,\nwhich allow Truist to cancel the commitment\ndue to deterioration in the borrowers\u2019\ncreditworthiness. The fair values of\ncommitments are estimated using the fees\ncharged to enter into similar agreements,\ntaking into account the remaining terms of the\nagreements and the present creditworthiness of\nthe counterparties. The fair values of\nguarantees and letters of credit are estimated\nbased on the counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness\nand average default rates for loan products\nwith similar risks. Consumer lending and\nrevolving credit commitments have an\nimmaterial fair value as Truist typically has\nthe unconditional ability to cancel such\ncommitments. Refer to \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures\u201d for additional disclosures on the\nRUFC.\n\nTruist has sold certain mortgage-related loans\nthat contain recourse provisions. These\nprovisions generally require Truist to\nreimburse the investor for a share of any loss\nthat is incurred after the disposal of the\nproperty. Truist also issues standard\nrepresentations and warranties related to\nmortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to \u201cNote 8.\nLoan Servicing\u201d for additional disclosures\nrelated to these exposures.\n\nLetters of credit and financial guarantees are\nunconditional commitments issued by Truist to\nguarantee the performance of a client to a\nthird party. These guarantees are primarily\nissued to support borrowing arrangements,\nincluding commercial paper issuance, bond\nfinancing and similar transactions. The credit\nrisk involved in the issuance of these\nguarantees is essentially the same as that\ninvolved in extending loans to clients and, as\nsuch, the instruments are collateralized when\nnecessary.\nThe following is a summary of selected\nnotional amounts of off-balance sheet\nfinancial instruments:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Commitme\u2026                                   \n  to                                          \n  extend,                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  or           $     210,645    $    207,285  \n  purchase                                    \n  credit                                      \n  and other                                   \n  commitme\u2026                                   \n  Resident\u2026                                   \n  mortgage                                    \n  loans                  146             173  \n  sold with                                   \n  recourse                                    \n  CRE                                         \n  mortgages                                   \n  serviced                                    \n  for                                         \n  others               9,985           9,661  \n  covered                                     \n  by                                          \n  recourse                                    \n  provisio\u2026                                   \n  Other                                       \n  loans                                       \n  serviced                                    \n  for                                         \n  others               2,022           1,032  \n  covered                                     \n  by                                          \n  recourse                                    \n  and other                                   \n  provisio\u2026                                   \n  Letters              7,532           6,239  \n  of credit                                   \n                                              \n              Truist Financial Corporation 141\nTotal Return Swaps\n\nThe Company enters into TRS transactions with\nthird-party clients, whereby a VIE purchases\nreference assets identified by a client. The\nCompany financially supports the VIE\u2019s\npurchases of the reference assets. Reference\nassets are typically fixed income instruments\nprimarily composed of syndicated bank loans.\nThe TRS contracts pass through interest and\nother cash flows on the reference assets to\nthe third-party clients, along with exposing\nthose clients to decreases in value on the\nreference assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the reference\nassets. The terms of the TRS contracts require\nthe third-party clients to post initial margin\ncollateral, as well as ongoing variation\nmargin as the fair values of the underlying\nreference assets change. The following table\nprovides a summary of the TRS transactions\nwith the associated VIE referenced assets,\nwhich include trading loans and bonds:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  VIE          $       1,854    $      1,641  \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  loans and            1,473           1,572  \n  bonds                                       \n  VIE                    356              50  \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n                                              \nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, which could potentially be\nsignificant. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets, and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts.\n\nOther Commitments\n\nTruist holds public funds in certain states\nthat do not require 100% collateralization on\npublic fund bank deposits. In these states,\nshould the failure of another public fund\ndepository institution result in a loss for\nthe public entity, the resulting\nuncollateralized deposit shortfall would have\nto be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon\nthe public deposits held by each bank within\nthe respective state) by the remaining\nfinancial institutions holding public funds in\nthat state. Truist monitors deposit levels\nrelative to the total public deposits held by\nall depository institutions within these\nstates. The likelihood that the Company would\nhave to perform under this guarantee is\ndependent on whether any financial\ninstitutions holding public funds default, as\nwell as the adequacy of collateral coverage.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Truist\nindemnifies its officers and directors to the\nfullest extent permitted by law against\nliabilities arising from pending litigation.\nTruist also issues standard representations\nand warranties in underwriting agreements,\nmerger and acquisition agreements, loan sales,\nbrokerage activities and other similar\narrangements. Counterparties in many of these\nindemnification arrangements provide similar\nindemnifications to Truist. Although these\nagreements often do not specify limitations,\nTruist does not believe that any payments\nrelated to these guarantees would materially\nchange the financial position or results of\noperations of Truist.\n\nAs a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to\nmaintain a minimum investment in capital\nstock. The board of directors of the FHLB can\nincrease the minimum investment requirements\nin the event it has concluded that additional\ncapital is required to allow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital requirements. Any\nincrease in the minimum investment\nrequirements outside of specified ranges\nrequires the approval of the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency. Because the extent of any\nobligation to increase Truist\u2019s investment in\nthe FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence\nof a future event, potential future\ninvestments in the FHLB stock are not\ndeterminable.\n\nThe Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation for trade comparisons, netting,\nand settlement of fixed income securities. As\na Government Securities Division netting\nmember, the Company has a commitment to the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation to meet its\nfinancial obligations as a central\ncounterparty clearing house in the event the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation has\ninsufficient liquidity resources through a\npotential committed liquidity resource\nrepurchase transaction. Any commitment would\nbe based on the Company\u2019s share of its\nliquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Truist does not believe that any\npayments related to these guarantees would\nmaterially change the financial position or\nresults of operations of Truist.\n\n142 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral. The following table provides\nthe total carrying amount of pledged assets by\nasset type:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Dec 31,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pledged      $      48,058    $     41,270  \n  securiti\u2026                                   \n  Pledged                                     \n  loans:                                      \n  FRB                 93,497          73,898  \n  FHLB                71,931          67,748  \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB                 72,040          55,252  \n  FHLB                31,411          24,712  \n                                              \nLegal Proceedings and Other Matters\n\nTruist is routinely named as a defendant in or\na party to numerous actual or threatened legal\nproceedings and other matters and is or may be\nsubject to potential liability in connection\nwith them. The legal proceedings and other\nmatters may be formal or informal and include\nlitigation and arbitration with one or more\nidentified claimants, certified or purported\nclass actions with yet-to-be-identified\nclaimants, and regulatory or other\ngovernmental information-gathering requests,\nexaminations, investigations, and enforcement\nproceedings. Claims may be based in law or\nequity\u2014such as those arising under contracts\nor in tort and those involving banking,\nconsumer-protection, securities, antitrust,\ntax, employment, and other laws\u2014and some\npresent novel legal theories, allegations of\nsubstantial or indeterminate damages, demands\nfor injunctive or similar relief, and requests\nfor fines, penalties, restitution, or\nalterations in Truist\u2019s business practices.\nOur legal proceedings and other matters exist\nin varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration, negotiation, or investigation and\nspan our business lines and operations.\n\nThe course and outcome of legal proceedings\nand other matters are inherently\nunpredictable. This is especially so when a\nmatter is still in its early stages, the\ndamages sought are indeterminate or\nunsupported, significant facts are unclear or\ndisputed, novel questions of law or other\nmeaningful legal uncertainties exist, a\nrequest to certify a proceeding as a class\naction is outstanding or granted, multiple\nparties are named, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental entities are involved. As a\nresult, we often are unable to determine how\nor when actual or threatened legal proceedings\nand other matters will be resolved and what\nlosses may be incrementally and ultimately\nincurred. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including the\nmatter described below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal\nproceedings and other matters when potential\nlosses become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. Accruals are\nevaluated each quarter and may be adjusted,\nupward or downward, based on our best judgment\nafter consultation with counsel and others. No\nassurance exists that our accruals will not\nneed to be adjusted in the future. Actual\nlosses may be higher or lower than any amounts\naccrued, possibly to a significant degree.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 375million as of December 31,\n2024. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company judged the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nmay change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses, like accruals, are based upon\ncurrently available information and involve\nconsiderable uncertainties and judgment.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the matter\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. These matters are\nnot accrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 143\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint\nasserts claims for violations of civil and\ncriminal usury laws, conversion, and money had\nand received, and seeks damages on a class-\nwide basis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nclass seeks a return of up to $ 452million in\npaid overdraft fees from the 2006 to 2017\nperiod above, plus prejudgment interest which,\nbased on the amount of claimed fees, was\nestimated to be approximately $ 431million as\nof December 31, 2024. A court-ordered\nmediation was held on February 28, 2024, but\nno resolution was reached. On March 4, 2024,\nthe trial court issued an order granting in\npart and denying in part Truist\u2019s motions to\namend the class definition to narrow the scope\nof the class, to compel arbitration against\ncertain class members, and for summary\njudgment. Truist and the class separately\nappealed the trial court\u2019s order to the\nGeorgia Court of Appeals. On February 20,\n2025, the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled on\nthe appeals and affirmed in part and reversed\nin part the trial court\u2019s March 4, 2024 order.\nTruist continues to assess the court\u2019s\nrulings.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nThe FDIC implemented a special assessment to\nrecoup losses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in 2023. The assessment is based on\nan insured depository institution\u2019s estimated\nuninsured deposits reported as of December 31,\n2022. The special assessment for Truist Bank\nwas $ 64million and $ 507million for the years\nended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Truist Bank may be subject to\nadditional adjustments due to change in the\nestimated relevant losses to the DIF reported\nby the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided\nnotification that the collection period will\nbe extended an additional two quarters beyond\nthe initial eight quarterly installments. The\nspecial assessment will be paid in ten\nquarterly installments, which began in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley\nBank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank,\nwhich could result in additional expense.\n\n144 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\n\nTruist Bank is subject to laws and regulations\nthat limit the amount of dividends it can pay.\nIn addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to various regulatory restrictions\nrelating to the payment of dividends,\nincluding requirements to maintain capital at\nor above regulatory minimums, and to remain\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the prompt corrective\naction regulations.\n\nTruist is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements administered by the\nFederal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements. Under capital\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany must meet specific capital guidelines\nthat involve quantitative measures of assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated pursuant to regulatory\ndirectives. Truist\u2019s capital amounts and\nclassification also are subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings and other factors. Truist is\nin compliance with these requirements. Banking\nregulations also identify five capital\ncategories for IDIs: well-capitalized,\nadequately capitalized, undercapitalized,\nsignificantly undercapitalized, and critically\nundercapitalized.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\ninvestments totaling $ 535million and $\n459million, respectively, have been excluded\nfrom the table above as they are valued based\non net asset value as a practical expedient.\nThese investments primarily consist of certain\nSBIC funds.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nfor Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities\nthat are measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis.\n\nAvailable for Sale and Trading Securities:\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available-for-sale and trading\nportfolios. The Company uses prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes, or\nrecent trades to estimate the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of AFS securities\nwere priced by third-party vendors whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. The\nAFS securities and trading securities are\nsubject to IPV. Management independently\nevaluates the fair values of AFS Securities\nand trading securities through comparisons to\nexternal pricing sources, review of additional\ninformation provided by the pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on any security sales to the\npricing information received from the pricing\nservice. Fair value measurements for trading\nsecurities are derived from observable market-\nbased information including overall market\nconditions, recent trades, comparable\nsecurities, broker quotes and FINRA\u2019s Trade\nReporting and Compliance Engine data when\ndetermining the value of a position. Security\nprices are also validated through actual cash\nsettlement upon the sale of a security. As\ndescribed by security type below, additional\ninputs may be used, or some inputs may not be\napplicable.\n\nTrading loans: The Company has elected to\nmeasure trading loans at fair value. Trading\nloans are valued primarily using quoted prices\nfor similar instruments in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active by\na third-party pricing service. Trading loans\ninclude loans held in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans and loans made or acquired in\nconnection with the Company\u2019s TRS business.\n\nU.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities\nare valued using quoted prices in active over-\nthe-counter markets.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 147\nGSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities\nconsist of debt obligations issued by U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development,\nthe FHLB, and other agencies, as well as\nsecurities collateralized by loans that are\nguaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. Agency MBS includes pass-through\nsecurities and CMOs issued by GSEs and U.S.\ngovernment agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and\nGNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by\nthe issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including benchmark TBA security\npricing and yield curves that were estimated\nbased on U.S. Treasury yields and certain\nfloating rate indices. The pricing matrices\nfor these securities may also give\nconsideration to pool-specific data supplied\ndirectly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using\nmarket-based pricing matrices that are based\non observable inputs including offers, bids,\nreported trades, dealer quotes and market\nresearch reports, the characteristics of a\nspecific tranche, market convention prepayment\nspeeds and benchmark yield curves as described\nabove.\n\nStates and political subdivisions: The\nCompany\u2019s investments in U.S. states and\npolitical subdivisions include obligations of\ncounty and municipal authorities and agency\nbonds, which are general obligations of the\nmunicipality or are supported by a specified\nrevenue source. Holdings are geographically\ndispersed, with no significant concentrations\nin any one state or municipality.\nAdditionally, all municipal obligations are\nhighly rated or are otherwise collateralized\nby securities backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the federal government. These\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer\nspreads, material event notices and benchmark\nyield curves.\n\nNon-agency MBS: Non-agency MBS included\npurchased interests in third-party\nsecuritizations that have a high investment\ngrade rating, and the pricing matrices for\nthese securities were based on observable\ninputs including offers, bids, reported\ntrades, dealer quotes and market research\nreports, the characteristics of a specific\ntranche, market convention prepayment speeds\nand benchmark yield curves as described above.\n\nCorporate and other debt securities: These\nsecurities consist primarily of corporate\nbonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds\nare senior and subordinated debt obligations\nof domestic corporations. The Company acquires\ncommercial paper that is generally short-term\nin nature and highly rated. These securities\nare valued based on a review of quoted market\nprices for similar assets as well as through\nthe various other inputs discussed previously.\n\nLHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are\noriginated to be sold to investors are carried\nat fair value. The fair value is primarily\nbased on quoted market prices for securities\nbacked by similar types of loans, adjusted for\nservicing, interest rate risk, and credit\nrisk. The changes in fair value of these\nassets are largely driven by changes in\ninterest rates subsequent to loan funding and\nchanges in the fair value of servicing\nassociated with the mortgage LHFS.\n\nLoans and leases: Fair values for loans are\nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology\nthat considered credit loss expectations,\nmarket interest rates, and other market\nfactors such as liquidity from the perspective\nof a market participant. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default, and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninter nal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate was\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof each loan. The discount rates used for\nloans are based on current market rates for\nnew originations of comparable loans and\ninclude adjustments for liquidity.\n\nLoan servicing rights: Residential MSRs are\nvalued using an OAS valuation model to project\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios and then are discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified\nservicing fees, prepayment assumptions,\ndelinquency rates, late charges, other\nancillary revenue, costs to service and other\neconomic factors. Fair value estimates and\nassumptions are compared to industry surveys,\nrecent market activity, actual portfolio\nexperience and other observable market data.\nCommercial MSRs and other loan servicing\nrights are valued using a cash flow valuation\nmodel that calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows. The\nCompany considers actual and expected loan\nprepayment rates, discount rates, servicing\ncosts, and other economic factors that are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nadditional information on valuation techniques\nand inputs for loan servicing rights.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities: The Company\nholds derivative instruments for both trading\nand risk management purposes. These include\nexchange-traded futures or option contracts,\nOTC swaps, options, forwards, interest rate\nlock commitments, and risk participation\nagreements. The fair values of derivatives are\ndetermined based on quoted market prices and\ninternal pricing models that use market\nobservable assumptions for interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair\nvalues of interest rate lock commitments,\nwhich are related to mortgage loan commitments\nand are categorized as Level 3, are based on\nquoted market prices adjusted for commitments\nthat are not expected to fund and include the\nvalue attributable to the net servicing fees.\nFunding rates are based on the Company\u2019s\nhistorical data. The fair value attributable\nto servicing is based on discounted cash\nflows, and is impacted by prepayment\nassumptions, discount rates, delinquency\nrates, contractually specified servicing fees,\nservicing costs, and underlying portfolio\ncharacteristics. Refer to \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments\u201d for additional\ninformation on derivative assets and\nliabilities.\n\n148 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nEquity securities: Equity securities primarily\nconsist of exchange-traded securities and are\nvalued using quoted prices in active markets.\n\nPrivate equity investments: In many cases\nthere are no observable market values for\nthese investments, and therefore, management\nmust estimate the fair value based on a\ncomparison of the operating performance of the\ninvestee to multiples in the marketplace for\nsimilar entities. This analysis requires\nsignificant judgment, and actual values in a\nsale could differ materially from those\nestimated.\n\nBrokered time deposits : The Company has\nelected to measure certain CDs that contain\nembedded derivatives at fair value. This fair\nvalue election better aligns the economics of\nthe CDs with the Company\u2019s risk management\nstrategies. The Company elects, on an\ninstrument by instrument basis, whether a new\nissuance will be measured at fair value. The\nCompany has classified CDs measured at fair\nvalue as level 2 instruments due to the\nCompany\u2019s ability to observe all significant\ninputs to model-derived valuations in active\nmarkets. The Company employs a discounted cash\nflow approach based on observable market\ninterest rates for the term of the CD and an\nestimate of the Bank\u2019s credit risk. For any\nembedded derivative features, the Company uses\nthe same valuation methodologies as if the\nderivative feature were a standalone\nderivative.\n\nSecurities sold short: Securities sold short\nrepresent debt securities sold short that are\nentered into as a hedging strategy for the\npurposes of supporting institutional and\nretail client trading activities. The fair\nvalue of securities sold short is determined\nin the same manner as trading securities.\n\nOther trading liabilities: Other trading\nliabilities includes loans sold, but not yet\npurchased in connection with the Company\u2019s\ntrading business primarily consisting of\ncommercial and corporate leveraged loans.\nLoans sold, but not yet purchased are valued\nprimarily using quoted prices for similar\ninstruments in active markets.\nActivity for Level 3 assets and liabilities is\nsummarized below:\n                                              \n  (Dol\u2026       Loans         Loan

Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales, or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience, and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At December 31,\n2024, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one\nyearto 10years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

Operating Segments                 \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment.\n\nFollowing the segment realignment, Truist\noperates and measures business activity across\ntwosegments: CSBB and WB, with functional\nactivities included in OT&C. The Company\u2019s\nbusiness segment structure is based on the\nmanner in which financial information is\nevaluated by management as well as the\nproducts and services provided or the type of\nclient served. The Chairman and CEO is the\nTruist CODM. The CODM regularly reviews\nsegment net income and its significant\ncomponents in comparison to expected results\nas part of evaluating segment performance and\noptimizing resource allocation. In this\nregular review, segment net income typically\nexcludes amortization of intangibles,\nrestructuring charges, and goodwill impairment\nwhich are separately presented in the table\nbelow.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group,\nrepresenting substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s IH segment, which represented a\nmaterial strategic shift for the Company, and\nas a result, the Company recast results for\nall periods presented under the discontinued\noperations basis of presentation. On May 6,\n2024, the Company completed the sale of its\nremaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the\nprincipal legal entity of the IH segment. As\nthe operations of TIH were included in\ndiscontinued operations prior to the sale of\nTIH, the Company no longer presents the IH\nsegment as one of its reportable segments.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information related to discontinued\noperations.\n\nConsumer and Small Business Banking\n\nCSBB serves retail, premier, and small\nbusiness clients, providing transaction, money\nmarket, savings, time deposits and payment\nservices, credit cards, loans, and mortgages\nthrough digital banking, an extensive network\nof community banking branches, ATMs, virtual\nservice centers, and other channels. Lending\nsolutions include personal and unsecured loans\noriginated through the branch network and\ndigital channels; national indirect lending\nservices providing a comprehensive set of\ntechnology-enabled consumer lending solutions,\nincluding point-of-sale offerings for autos,\nrecreational vehicles, outdoor power sports,\noutdoor power equipment, and home improvement;\nand real estate lending providing residential\nmortgages through its retail, direct, and\ncorrespondent channels, and home equity loans\ndelivered through the branch network.\n\nWholesale Banking\n\nWB segment provides a comprehensive set of\nproducts, solutions, and advisory services to\ncommercial, corporate, institutional and\nwealth clients. Banking expertise and product\ncapabilities are delivered through a\ncombination of regional coverage across the\nTruist footprint and national industry\ncoverage for real estate, and investment\nbanking and capital markets clients. The\nsegment works with clients to meet their core\nbanking needs, including traditional and\nspecialized credit solutions and commercial\npayments to manage deposits and liquidity,\npayables, and receivables. Through investment\nbanking capabilities, clients have full access\nto strategic advisory services, debt and\nequity capital markets, leveraged finance, and\nsecuritizations, with distribution channels\nand market making across both fixed income and\nequity markets. The segment also invests in\ncertain affordable housing, New Market Tax\nCredit, and renewable energy tax credit\ninvestments. For additional information on\nthese investments, see \u201cNote 16. Commitments\nand Contingencies\u201d. The wealth business\ndelivers asset management, trust, brokerage,\nand investment management, as well as\nspecialized commercial products to Truist\nclients, while aligning closely with regional\nand industry banking coverage.\n\nOther, Treasury & Corporate\n\nOT&C includes management of the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, long-term\ndebt, derivative instruments used for balance\nsheet hedging, short-term liquidity and\nfunding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement and most bank-owned real estate\nassets, as well as the Company\u2019s functional\nactivities such as finance, enterprise risk,\nlegal, and enterprise technology and\nmanagement, among others. Additionally, OT&C\nhouses intersegment eliminations, including\nintersegment net referral fees and residual\ninterest rate risk.\n\nTruist promotes revenue growth by bringing the\nfull breadth and depth of Truist\u2019s products\nand services to meet clients\u2019 financial needs.\nThe objective is to deepen client\nrelationships by providing Truist\u2019s entire\nsuite of products to its clients with the end\ngoal of providing clients the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. Revenues of\ncertain products and services are reflected in\nthe results of the segment providing those\nproducts and services and are also allocated\nto CSBB and WB. These allocated revenues\nbetween segments are reflected as net referral\nfees in noninterest income and eliminated in\nOT&C.\n\n158 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include the items as detailed\nbelow.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up for the WB\nsegment on a pre-tax equivalent basis, related\nprimarily to certain community development\ninvestments. Recoveries for these allocations\nare reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\nEffective October 1, 2024, the Company\u2019s\ncorporate expense allocation methodology was\nenhanced to allocate certain overhead or\nfunctional expenses based on actual OT&C\nnoninterest expense performance. Prior period\nresults have been revised for the CSBB, WB,\nand OT&C segments to conform to the current\nallocation methodology.\n\nAs a result of the methodology change, CSBB\nnoninterest expense increased $ 267million and\n$ 639million for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, with an off-\nsetting decrease in OT&C noninterest expense.\nFor the same reason, WB noninterest expense\nincreased $ 325million and $ 101million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, with an off-setting decrease in\nOT&C noninterest expense.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. When significant changes to\nmanagement reporting methodologies take place,\nthe impact of these changes is quantified and\nprior period information is revised as\npracticable.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 159\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) As described above, includes the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, most long-\nterm debt, derivative instruments used for\nbalance sheet hedging, short-term liquidity\nand funding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement, most bank-owned real estate\nassets, as well as functional activities such\nas finance, enterprise risk, legal, and\nenterprise technology and management.\nAdditionally, houses intersegment\neliminations, including for residual interest\nrate risk, intersegment net referral fees, and\nexpense allocations.

The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP. Truist\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that (1) pertain\nto the maintenance of records, that in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and disposition of\nthe Company\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit the preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP\nand that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with\nthe authorizations of Truist\u2019s management and\ndirectors; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material impact on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements.
