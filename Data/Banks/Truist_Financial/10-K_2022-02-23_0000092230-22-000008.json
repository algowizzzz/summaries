statements.\n\nForward-looking statements are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead represent\nmanagement\u2019s expectations and assumptions\nregarding Truist\u2019s business, the economy, and\nother future conditions. Such statements\ninvolve inherent uncertainties, risks, and\nchanges in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. As such, Truist\u2019s actual results may\ndiffer materially from those contemplated by\nforward-looking statements. While there can be\nno assurance that any list of risks and\nuncertainties or risk factors is complete,\nimportant factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by forward-looking statements\ninclude the following, without limitation, as\nwell as the risks and uncertainties more fully\ndiscussed in Item 1A-Risk Factors:\n\n\u2022 risks and

or\nacquisitions may be greater than anticipated;\n\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global\neconomy and adversely impacted Truist\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations,\nincluding through increased expenses, reduced\nfee income and net interest margin, decreased\ndemand for certain types of loans, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses;\na resurgence of the pandemic, whether due to\nnew variants of the coronavirus or other\nfactors, could reintroduce or prolong these\nnegative impacts and also adversely affect\nTruist\u2019s capital and liquidity position or\ncost of capital, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause an\noutflow of deposits, and impair goodwill or\nother assets;\n\n\u2022 Truist is subject to credit risk by lending\nor committing to lend money, and may have more\ncredit risk and higher credit losses to the\nextent that loans are concentrated by loan\ntype, industry segment, borrower type or\nlocation of the borrower or collateral;\n\n\u2022 changes in the interest rate environment,\nincluding the replacement of LIBOR as an\ninterest rate benchmark, which could adversely\naffect Truist\u2019s revenue and expenses, the\nvalue of assets and obligations, and the\navailability and cost of capital, cash flows,\nand liquidity;\n\n\u2022 inability to access short-term funding or\nliquidity, loss of client deposits or changes\nin Truist\u2019s credit ratings, which could\nincrease the cost of funding or limit access\nto capital markets;\n\n\u2022 risk management oversight

or integrate mergers and\nacquisitions;\n\n\u2022 increased competition, including from (i)\nnew or existing competitors that could have\ngreater financial resources or be subject to\ndifferent regulatory standards, and (ii)\nproducts and services offered by non-bank\nfinancial technology companies, may reduce\nTruist\u2019s client base, cause Truist to lower\nprices for its products and services in order\nto maintain market share or otherwise\nadversely impact Truist\u2019s businesses or\nresults of operations;\n\n\u2022 failure to maintain or enhance Truist\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to new\nproducts, services and technology, whether it\nfails to anticipate client expectations or\nbecause its technological developments fail to\nperform as desired or do not achieve market\nacceptance or regulatory approval or for other\nreasons, may cause Truist to lose market share\nor incur additional expense;\n\n\u2022 negative public opinion, which could

down to goodwill if there is an\nelongated period of decline in market value\nfor Truist\u2019s stock and adverse economic\nconditions are sustained over a period of\ntime;\n\n\u2022 general economic or business conditions,\neither globally, nationally or regionally, may\nbe less favorable than expected, and\ninstability in global geopolitical matters or\nvolatility in financial markets could

originating and selling\nmortgages, including repurchase and indemnity\ndemands from purchasers related to\nrepresentations and warranties on loans sold,\nwhich could result in an increase in the\namount of losses for loan repurchases;\n\n\u2022 risks relating to Truist\u2019s role as a loan\nservicer, including an increase in the scope\nor costs of the services Truist is required

exacerbated in the\nincreased work-from-home environment caused by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic as job markets may be\nless constrained by physical geography;\n\n\u2022 fraud or misconduct by internal or

create\nsignificant legal or financial exposure; and\n\n\u2022 widespread outages of operational,\ncommunication, or other systems, whether\ninternal or provided by third parties, natural\nor other disasters (including acts of\nterrorism and pandemics), and the effects of\nclimate change, including physical risks, such\nas more frequent and intense weather events,\nand risks related to the

Competition                                 \n                                              \nThe financial services industry is intensely\ncompetitive and constantly evolving.\nManagement believes that Truist\u2019s community\nbank approach to providing client service is a\ncompetitive advantage that strengthens the\nCompany\u2019s ability to effectively provide\nfinancial products and services to businesses\nand individuals in its markets. In addition,\nmanagement has made significant investments in\nrecent years to develop its digital platform\nand believes that its mobile and online\napplications are highly competitive in meeting\nclients' expectations. Legislative,\nregulatory, economic, and technological\nchanges, as well as continued consolidation\nwithin the industry, could result in increased\ncompetition from new and existing market\nparticipants. Truist\u2019s subsidiaries compete\nactively with national, regional, and local\nfinancial services providers, including banks,\nthrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers,\nfinance companies, financial technology\ncompanies, and insurance companies. The\nability of non-banking entities, including\nfinancial technology companies, to provide\nservices previously limited to commercial\nbanks has increased competition. Non-banking\nentities are not subject to the same\nregulatory framework as banks and BHCs, and\ntherefore, can often operate with greater\nflexibility and lower costs. In addition, the\nability to access and use technology is an\nincreasingly significant competitive factor in\nthe financial services industry. Having the\nright technology is a critically important\ncomponent to client satisfaction because it\naffects the Company\u2019s ability to deliver the\nproducts and services that clients desire in a\nmanner that they find convenient and\nattractive. Management believes that the\nCompany is well positioned to compete and that\nits continued focus on touch and technology\nwill engender trust among its current and\nfuture clients.\n                                              \n  General Business Development                \n                                              \nTruist seeks to satisfy all of its clients'\nfinancial needs, enabling the Company to grow\nand diversify its sources of revenue and\nprofitability. Truist\u2019s long-term strategy\nencompasses both organic and inorganic growth,\nincluding mergers or acquisitions of\ncomplementary financial institutions or other\nbusinesses.\n                                              \n  Merger and Acquisition Strategy             \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s merger and acquisition strategy\nfocuses on meeting the following criteria:\n\n\u2022 the organization must be a good fit with\nTruist\u2019s culture;\n\n\u2022 the merger or acquisition must be\nstrategically attractive;\n\n\u2022 associated risks must be identified and\nmitigation plans put in place, such that any\nresidual risks fall within Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite; and\n\n\u2022 the transaction must meet Truist\u2019s financial\ncriteria.\n\nTruist\u2019s growth in business, profitability,\nand market share has historically been\nenhanced by strategic mergers and\nacquisitions. Truist will assess future\nopportunities, based on geography and market\nconditions, and may, among other\npossibilities, pursue economically\nadvantageous acquisitions of banks, insurance\nagencies, certain lending businesses, and fee\nincome generating financial services\nbusinesses.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Considerations                   \n                                              \nThe regulatory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and the stability of\nthe U.S. financial system, rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and creditors. In\naddition to banking laws and regulations,\nTruist is subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect the operations and\nmanagement of Truist and its ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. Truist and its\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes,\nregulations, and policies are continually\nunder review by Congress, state legislatures,\nand federal and state regulatory agencies. In\naddition to laws and regulations, state and\nfederal bank regulatory agencies may issue\npolicy statements, interpretive letters, and\nsimilar written guidance applicable to Truist\nand its subsidiaries. Any change in the\nstatutes, regulations, or regulatory policies\napplicable to Truist, including changes in\ntheir interpretation or implementation, could\nhave a material effect on its business or\norganization.\n\nThe scope of the laws and regulations, and the\nintensity of the supervision to which Truist\nis subject have increased in recent years,\ninitially in response to the financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors,\nincluding technological factors, market\nchanges, climate, as well as increased\nscrutiny and possible denials of bank mergers\nand acquisitions by federal bank regulators.\nRegulatory enforcement and fines have also\nincreased across the banking and financial\nservices sector. Truist expects that its\nbusiness will remain subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws to which\nTruist is subject. These descriptions do not\nsummarize all possible or proposed changes in\nlaws or regulations and are not intended to be\na substitute for the related statues or\nregulatory provisions.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 5\n                                              \n  General                                     \n                                              \nAs a BHC, Truist is subject to regulation\nunder the BHCA and to regulation, examination,\nand supervision by the FRB. Truist Bank, a\nNorth Carolina state-chartered commercial bank\nthat is not a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, is subject to regulation, supervision,\nand examination by the NCCOB and the FDIC.\nTruist Bank and its affiliates are also\nsubject to examination by the CFPB for\ncompliance with most federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws.\n\nTruist and certain of its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, including those that engage in\nderivatives transactions, securities\nunderwriting, market making, brokerage,\ninvestment advisory, and insurance activities,\nare subject to other federal and state laws\nand regulations, as well as supervision and\nexamination by other federal and state\nregulatory agencies and other regulatory\nauthorities, including the SEC, CFTC, FINRA,\nand the NYSE. Truist Bank is also subject to\nadditional state and federal laws, as well as\nvarious compliance regulations, that govern\nits activities, the investments it makes, and\nthe aggregate amount of loans that may be\ngranted to one borrower.\n\nExaminations by Truist\u2019s regulators consider\nnot only compliance with applicable laws,\nregulations, and supervisory policies of the\nagency, but also capital levels, asset\nquality, risk management effectiveness, the\nability and performance of management, and the\nboard of directors, the effectiveness of\ninternal controls, earnings, liquidity, and\nvarious other factors. Following those\nexaminations, Truist and Truist Bank are\nassigned supervisory ratings. This supervisory\nframework, including the examination reports\nand supervisory ratings, which are considered\nconfidential supervisory information, could\nmaterially impact the conduct, growth, and\nprofitability of Truist\u2019s operations.\n\nUnder the FRB's Large Financial Institution\nRating System, component ratings are assigned\nfor capital planning, liquidity risk\nmanagement, and governance and controls. To be\nconsidered \"well managed\" under this rating\nsystem, a firm must be rated \"broadly meets\nexpectations\" or \"conditionally meets\nexpectations\" for each of its three component\nratings.\n\nThe results of examinations by any of Truist\u2019s\nfederal bank regulators potentially can result\nin the imposition of significant limitations\non Truist\u2019s activities and growth. These\nregulatory agencies generally have broad\nenforcement authority and discretion to impose\nrestrictions and limitations on the operations\nof a regulated entity, including the\nimposition of substantial monetary penalties\nand nonmonetary requirements against a\nregulated entity where the relevant agency\ndetermines that the operations of the\nregulated entity or any of its subsidiaries\nfail to comply with applicable laws or\nregulations, are conducted in an unsafe or\nunsound manner, or represent an unfair or\ndeceptive act or practice.\n                                              \n  FHC Regulation                              \n                                              \nTruist has elected to be treated as a FHC,\nwhich allows it to engage in a broader range\nof activities than would otherwise be\npermissible for a BHC, including activities\nthat are financial in nature or incidental\nthereto, such as securities underwriting or\nmerchant banking. While FHCs may engage in\ncertain acquisitions without prior approval of\nthe FRB, any acquisition over $10 billion in\nassets would require prior approval by the\nFRB. In order to maintain its status as a FHC,\nTruist and its affiliated IDI must be well-\ncapitalized and well-managed and Truist Bank\nmust have at least a satisfactory CRA rating.\nIf the FRB determines that a FHC is not well-\ncapitalized or well-managed, the FRB may\nimpose corrective capital and managerial\nrequirements on the FHC, and may place\nlimitations on its ability to conduct certain\nbusiness activities that FHCs are generally\npermitted to conduct and its ability to make\ncertain acquisitions. If the failure to meet\nthese standards persists, a FHC may be\nrequired to divest its IDI subsidiaries, or\ncease all activities other than those\nactivities that may be conducted by BHCs that\nare not FHCs. Furthermore, if an IDI\nsubsidiary of a FHC has not maintained a\nsatisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be\nable to commence any new financial activities\nor acquire a company that engages in such\nactivities, although the FHC would still be\nallowed to engage in activities closely\nrelated to banking and make investments in the\nordinary course of conducting banking\nactivities. Longstanding federal regulations\nrequire a FHC to act as a source of financial\nand managerial strength for its subsidiary\nbanks. In times of severe financial stress,\nthe obligation to serve as a source of\nstrength could cause Truist to commit\nsignificant resources to supporting Truist\nBank that otherwise would be available to\nTruist\u2019s creditors and shareholders.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory\nTailoring Rules\n\nCertain U.S. BHCs, including Truist, are\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards. As\nsuch, Truist is subject to more stringent\nliquidity and capital requirements, leverage\nlimits, stress testing, resolution planning\nand risk management standards than those\napplicable to smaller institutions. Certain\nlarger banking organizations are subject to\nadditional enhanced prudential standards.\nTruist became subject to the FRB's single-\ncounterparty credit limit rule as of July 1,\n2020, and is subject to a limit of 25% of Tier\n1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures,\nincluding exposure resulting from, among other\ntransactions, extensions of credit, repurchase\nand reverse repurchase transactions,\ninvestments in securities and derivative\ntransactions, to any other unaffiliated\ncounterparty.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Truist is subject\nto the standards applicable to Category III\nbanking organizations, which generally include\nbank holding companies with greater than $250\nbillion, but less than $700 billion, in total\nconsolidated assets and less than $75 billion\nin certain risk-related exposures.\n\n6 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Resolution Planning                         \n                                              \nAs a Category III banking organization, Truist\nis required to submit a resolution plan every\nthree years. Later resolution plans under this\nrule will alternate between full resolution\nplans and targeted resolution plans. The FRB\nand the FDIC must review and evaluate Truist\u2019s\nresolution plan. The FRB and FDIC are\nauthorized to impose restrictions on growth\nand activities or operations if the agencies\ndetermine that a resolution plan is not\ncredible or would not facilitate a rapid and\norderly resolution of the company under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, and could require the\nbanking organization to divest assets or take\nother actions if it did not submit an\nacceptable resolution plan within two years\nafter any such restrictions were imposed.\nTruist submitted its inaugural resolution plan\nto the FRB and FDIC in September 2021, which\nis currently under review.\n\nIn addition, Truist Bank is required by an\nFDIC regulation to file a separate bank level\nresolution plan although that requirement has\nbeen paused since 2018. The FDIC issued a\npolicy statement in June 2021 announcing that\nit will resume requiring bank level resolution\nplans for large banks, including Truist Bank,\nand that such bank-level resolution plans will\nhave more streamlined content requirements\nthan previous requirements. Truist Bank will\nbe required to submit a bank-level resolution\nplan every three years. During 2021, Truist\nBank was informed by the FDIC that its next\nresolution plan will be due on or before\nDecember 1, 2022. The FDIC also clarified the\ncontent requirements of the next resolution\nplan that Truist Bank is required to submit.\n                                              \n  Capital Requirements                        \n                                              \nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to certain\nrisk-based capital and leverage ratio\nrequirements established by the FRB, for\nTruist, and by the FDIC, for Truist Bank.\nThese requirements are based on the capital\nframework developed by the BCBS for\nstrengthening the regulation, supervision, and\nrisk management of banks under Basel III\nrules, as well as certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. These quantitative\ncalculations are minimums, and the FRB and\nFDIC may determine that a banking\norganization, based on its size, complexity,\nor risk profile, must maintain a higher level\nof capital in order to operate in a safe and\nsound manner. Failure to be well capitalized\nor to meet minimum capital requirements could\nresult in certain mandatory and possible\nadditional discretionary actions by regulators\nthat, if undertaken, could have an adverse\nmaterial effect on Truist\u2019s operations or\nfinancial condition. These actions could\ninclude requiring Truist commit capital to\nTruist Bank in abnormal operating conditions\nwhich would otherwise be available to Truist\u2019s\ncreditors and shareholders. Failure to be well\ncapitalized or to meet minimum capital\nrequirements could also result in restrictions\non Truist\u2019s or Truist Bank's ability to pay\ndividends or otherwise distribute capital or\nto receive regulatory approval for\nacquisitions.\n\nIn October 2019, the federal banking\nregulators adopted rules that revised the\ncriteria for determining the applicability of\nregulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nfor large U.S. banking organizations,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, and that\ntailored the application of the FRB's enhanced\nprudential standards to large banking\norganizations. Under these rules, Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the standards\napplicable to \"Category III\" banking\norganizations.\n\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, Truist\u2019s\nand Truist Bank's assets, exposures, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items are subject to\nrisk weights used to determine the\ninstitutions' risk-weighted assets. These\nrisk-weighted assets are used to calculate the\nfollowing minimum capital ratios for Truist\nand Truist Bank:\n\n\u2022 CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\nCET1 capital primarily includes common\nshareholders' equity subject to certain\nregulatory adjustments and deductions,\nincluding with respect to goodwill, intangible\nassets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n\n\u2022 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted\nassets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised\nof CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock and\ncertain qualifying capital instruments.\n\n\u2022 Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the\nratio of total capital, including CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital,\nto risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital\nprimarily includes qualifying subordinated\ndebt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also\nincludes, among other things, certain trust\npreferred securities.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 7\nIn March 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule\nthat integrates its annual capital planning\nand stress testing requirements with existing\nregulatory capital requirements. For risk-\nbased capital requirements for certain large\nBHCs, including Truist, the SCB replaced the\ncapital conservation buffer, which was\nrequired to be met in order to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and repurchases of any\nTier 1 capital instrument, such as common and\nqualifying preferred stock, and certain\ndiscretionary incentive compensation payments.\nThe SCB is equal to the greater of (i) the\ndifference between Truist\u2019s starting and\nminimum projected CET1 capital ratios under\nthe severely adverse scenario in the\nsupervisory stress test, plus the sum of the\ndollar amount of its planned common stock\ndividends for each of the fourth through\nseventh quarters of the planning horizon as a\npercentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii)\n2.5%. The FRB assigned Truist an SCB of 2.5%,\nwhich is effective from October 1, 2021 to\nSeptember 30, 2022, at which point a revised\nSCB will be calculated and provided to Truist.\nAlthough the final rule continues to require\nthat the firm describe its planned capital\ndistributions in its CCAR capital plan, Truist\nis no longer required to seek prior approval\nif it makes capital distributions in excess of\nthose included in its CCAR capital plan.\nInstead, Truist is subject to automatic\ndistribution limitations if its capital ratios\nfall below its buffer requirements, which\ninclude the SCB.\n\nFor certain large banking organizations, the\nSCB could be supplemented by a countercyclical\ncapital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently\nset at zero. An FRB policy statement\nestablishes the framework and factors the FRB\nwould use in setting and adjusting the amount\nof the countercyclical capital buffer. Covered\nbanking organizations would generally have 12\nmonths after the announcement of any increase\nin the countercyclical capital buffer to meet\nthe increased buffer requirement, unless the\nFRB determines to establish an earlier\neffective date. If the full countercyclical\nbuffer amount is implemented, Truist and\nTruist Bank would be required to maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of at least 11.0%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of at least 13.0% to avoid\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary incentive compensation\npayments.\n\nCertain large banking organizations with\ntrading assets and liabilities above certain\nthresholds, including Truist, are subject to\nthe Market Risk Rule and must adjust their\nrisk-based capital ratios to reflect the\nmarket risk of their trading activities. Refer\nto the \"Market Risk\" section of the MD&A for\nadditional disclosures related to market risk\nmanagement.\n\nIn addition, Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio, equal to\nthe ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly\naverage assets, net of goodwill, certain other\nintangible assets, and certain other\ndeductions. Category III banking organizations\nare also subject to a minimum 3.0%\nsupplementary leverage ratio. The\nsupplementary leverage ratio is calculated by\ndividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage\nexposure, which takes into account on-balance\nsheet assets as well as certain off-balance\nsheet items, including loan commitments and\npotential future exposure of derivative\ncontracts.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB\nadopted a rule that temporarily changed the\nsupplementary leverage ratio to exclude U.S.\nTreasury securities and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks from the calculation of a firm's\nleverage exposure, which expired March 31,\n2021 and previously benefited Truist\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio by approximately\n20 basis points. The FRB announced plans to\ninvite public comment on several potential\nsupplementary leverage ratio modifications to\nensure that the supplementary leverage ratio\nremains effective in an environment of higher\nreserves, though such proposal has not been\npublished as of the date of this report.\n\nThe FRB has not yet revised the well-\ncapitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the\nhigher capital requirements imposed under the\nBasel III Rules. For purposes of certain FRB\nrules, including determining whether a BHC\nmeets the requirements to be a FHC, BHCs, such\nas Truist, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based\nCapital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total\nRisk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater\nto meet the well-capitalized minimum. The FRB\nmay require BHCs, including Truist, to\nmaintain capital ratios substantially in\nexcess of mandated minimum levels, depending\nupon general economic conditions and a BHC's\nparticular condition, risk profile, and growth\nplans. Refer to the \u201cCapital\u201d section in MD&A\nfor disclosures containing the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios and well-capitalized\nminimum ratios applicable to Category III\nbanking organizations.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a\nfinal rule that permits banking organizations\nthat implement CECL before the end of 2020 to\nelect to follow the three-year transition\navailable under the prior rule or a new five-\nyear transition to phase in the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital. Under the five-\nyear transition, the banking organization\nwould defer for two years 100% of the day-one\neffect of adopting CECL and 25% of the\ncumulative increase or decrease in the\nallowance for credit losses since adoption of\nCECL. Following the first two years, the\nelecting organization will phase out the\naggregate capital effects over the next three\nyears consistent with the transition in the\noriginal three-year transition rule. Truist\nhas elected to use the five-year transition to\nphase in the impacts of CECL on regulatory\ncapital.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final\nrule altering the definition of eligible\nretained income. Under the final rule,\neligible retained income is the greater of a\nfirm's (i) net income for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, net of any distributions\nand associated tax effects not already\nreflected in net income, and (ii) average net\nincome over the preceding four quarters. This\ndefinition applies with respect to all of\nTruist\u2019s capital requirements.\n\n8 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Capital Planning and Stress Testing         \n  Requirements                                \n                                              \nIn addition to the regulatory capital\nrequirements, under the FRB's CCAR process,\nTruist must submit an annual capital plan to\nthe FRB that reflects its projected financial\nperformance under hypothetical macro-economic\nscenarios, including a supervisory severely\nadverse scenario provided by the FRB.\n\nThe FRB's CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank\nAct stress testing framework also require BHCs\nsubject to Category III standards, such as\nTruist, to conduct company-run stress tests\nand submit to supervisory stress tests\nconducted by the FRB. The company-run stress\ntests employ stress scenarios provided by the\nFRB and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital\nactions, which are intended to normalize\ncapital distribution assumptions across large\nU.S. BHCs. In addition, Truist is required to\nconduct annual stress tests using internally-\ndeveloped scenarios intended to stress the\nunique risk profile of the institution. The\nFRB also conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act\nsupervisory stress tests employing internal\nsupervisory models on the supervisory stress\nscenarios. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to supervisory\nstress testing on an annual basis and company-\nrun stress testing on a biennial basis.\n\nTruist is required to submit its next capital\nplan and the results of its own stress tests\nto the FRB by April 5, 2022. The FRB is\nrequired to announce the results of its\nsupervisory stress tests by June 30, 2022.\n\nIn addition to the CCAR stress testing for\nTruist, Truist Bank conducts annual company-\nrun stress tests.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Requirements                      \n                                              \nCertain BHCs and their bank subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist and Truist Bank, are subject\nto a minimum LCR. The LCR is designed to\nensure that BHCs have sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets to survive a significant\nliquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar\ndays.\n\nTruist also is subject to FRB rules that\nrequire certain large BHCs to conduct internal\nliquidity stress tests over a range of time\nhorizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid\nassets sufficient to meet projected net\noutflows under the BHC's 30-day liquidity\nstress test, and maintain a contingency\nfunding plan that meets certain requirements.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. The NSFR,\ncalculated as the ratio of available stable\nfunding to required stable funding, must\nexceed 1.0x. Available stable funding\nrepresents a weighted measure of a company's\nfunding sources over a one-year time horizon,\ncalculated by applying standardized weightings\nto the company's equity and liabilities based\non their expected stability. Required Stable\nFunding is calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to assets, derivatives exposures\nand certain other items based on their\nliquidity characteristics. As a Category III\nbanking organization, Truist and Truist Bank\nare subject to an NSFR requirement equal to\n85% of the full requirement.\n                                              \n  Payment of Dividends                        \n                                              \nThe Parent Company is a legal entity separate\nand distinct from its subsidiaries, and it\ndepends in part upon dividends received from\nits direct and indirect subsidiaries,\nincluding Truist Bank, to fund its activities,\nincluding its ability to make capital\ndistributions, such as paying dividends or\nrepurchasing shares. Under federal law, there\nare various limitations on the extent to which\nTruist Bank can declare and pay dividends to\nthe Parent Company, including those related to\nregulatory capital requirements, general\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices, and federal banking law\nrequirements concerning the payment of\ndividends out of net profits, surplus, and\navailable earnings. Certain contractual\nrestrictions also may limit the ability of\nTruist Bank to pay dividends to the Parent\nCompany. No assurances can be given that\nTruist Bank will, in any circumstances, pay\ndividends to the Parent Company.\n\nThe Parent Company\u2019s ability to declare and\npay dividends is similarly limited by federal\nbanking law and FRB regulations and policy.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from\nmaking capital distributions if they would be\ndeemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice.\nThe FRB has indicated generally that it may be\nan unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay\ndividends unless a BHC's net income is\nsufficient to fund the dividends and the\nexpected rate of earnings retention is\nconsistent with the organization's capital\nneeds, asset quality, and overall financial\ncondition. In addition, the Parent Company\u2019s\nability to make capital distributions,\nincluding paying dividends and repurchasing\ncapital securities, is subject to the FRB's\nautomatic restrictions on capital\ndistributions under the FRB's capital rules.\nTruist\u2019s risk-based capital and leverage ratio\nrequirements are discussed below in the\n\"Capital Requirements\" section.\n\nNorth Carolina law provides that, as long as a\nbank does not make distributions that reduce\nits capital below its applicable required\ncapital, the board of directors of a bank\nchartered under the laws of North Carolina may\ndeclare such distributions as the directors\ndeem proper.\n                Truist Financial Corporation 9\n                                              \n  Prompt Corrective Action                    \n                                              \nThe federal banking agencies are required to\ntake \"prompt corrective action\" with respect\nto FDIC-insured depository institutions that\ndo not meet minimum capital requirements. The\nlaw establishes five categories for this\npurpose: \"well-capitalized,\" \"adequately\ncapitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\"\n\"significantly undercapitalized,\" and\n\"critically undercapitalized.\" To be\nconsidered \"well-capitalized,\" an IDI must\nmaintain minimum capital ratios and must not\nbe subject to any order or written directive\nto meet and maintain a specific capital level\nfor any capital measure. An institution that\nfails to remain well-capitalized becomes\nsubject to a series of restrictions that\nincrease in severity as its capital condition\nweakens. Such restrictions may include a\nprohibition on capital distributions,\nrestrictions on asset growth, or restrictions\non the ability to receive regulatory approval\nof applications. The regulations apply only to\nbanks and not to BHCs. However, the FRB is\nauthorized to take appropriate action at the\nholding company level, based on the\nundercapitalized status of the holding\ncompany's subsidiary banking institutions. In\ncertain instances relating to an\nundercapitalized banking institution, the BHC,\nin its capacity as a source of strength would\nbe required to guarantee the performance of\nthe undercapitalized subsidiary's capital\nrestoration plan and could be liable for civil\nmoney damages for failure to fulfill those\nguarantee commitments.\n\nIn addition, failure to meet capital\nrequirements may cause an institution to be\ndirected to raise additional capital. Federal\nlaw further mandates that the agencies adopt\nsafety and soundness standards generally\nrelating to operations and management, asset\nquality and executive compensation, and\nauthorizes administrative action against an\ninstitution that fails to meet such standards.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines may subject\na banking organization to a variety of other\nenforcement remedies, including additional\nsubstantial restrictions on its operations and\nactivities, termination of deposit insurance\nby the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the\nappointment of a conservator or receiver.\n                                              \n  Transactions with Affiliates                \n                                              \nThere are various legal restrictions on the\nextent to which Truist and its non-bank\nsubsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in\ncertain types of transactions with Truist\nBank. Under the Federal Reserve Act and FRB\nregulations, Truist Bank and its subsidiaries\nare subject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit, purchases of\nassets, and certain other transactions\ninvolving its non-bank affiliates. In\naddition, transactions between Truist Bank and\nits non-bank affiliates are required to be on\narm's length terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                              \n  Acquisitions                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to numerous laws that may\nrequire regulatory approval for acquisitions.\nFor example, under the BHCA, a BHC may not\ndirectly or indirectly acquire ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares\nor substantially all of the assets of any BHC\nor bank or merge or consolidate with another\nBHC without the prior approval of the FRB. The\nBHCA and other federal laws enumerate the\nfactors the FRB must consider when reviewing\nthe merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks\nor the acquisition of voting securities of a\nbank or BHC. These factors include the\ncompetitive effects of the proposal in the\nrelevant geographic markets; the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of\nthe companies and banks involved in the\ntransaction; the effect of the transaction on\nthe financial stability of the United States;\nthe organizations' compliance with anti-money\nlaundering laws and regulations; the\nconvenience and needs of the communities to be\nserved; and the records of performance under\nthe CRA of the IDIs involved in the\ntransaction.\n\nFederal law authorizes interstate acquisitions\nof banks and BHCs without geographic\nlimitation, and a bank headquartered in one\nstate is authorized to merge with a bank\nheadquartered in another state, subject to\nmarket share limitations, regulatory approvals\nand any state requirement that the target bank\nshall have been in existence and operating for\na minimum period of time. The market share\nlimitations impose conditions that the\nacquiring BHC, after and as a result of the\nacquisition, control no more than 10% of the\ntotal amount of deposits of IDIs in the U.S.\nand no more than 30%, subject to variation by\nstate law, of such deposits in applicable\nstates. FRB rules also prohibit a FHC from\ncombining with another company if the ratio of\nthe resulting company's liabilities exceeds\n10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities\nof all financial companies.\n\nAfter a bank has established branches in a\nstate through an interstate merger\ntransaction, the bank may establish and\nacquire additional branches at any location in\nthe state where a bank headquartered in that\nstate could have established or acquired\nbranches under applicable federal or state\nlaw. These regulatory considerations are\napplicable to privately negotiated acquisition\ntransactions.\n\nThe standards by which bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions are evaluated are\nunder review. Among other things, in July\n2021, an executive order was issued on\ncompetition that requires the banking agencies\nto review the standards for bank mergers, and\nthe Department of Justice has announced that\nit is reviewing its bank merger guidelines.\nAdditionally, some members of Congressional\nleadership are closely tracking the standards\nfor bank mergers and can be expected to engage\nin hearings and public statements in\nconnection with any pending or future merger\nactivity. These reviews and engagements could\nchange the standards for bank mergers.\n\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Other Safety and Soundness Regulations      \n                                              \nThe FRB has supervisory and enforcement powers\nover BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries.\nThe FRB has authority to prohibit activities\nthat represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nconstitute violations of law, rule,\nregulation, administrative order, or written\nagreement with a federal regulator. These\npowers may be exercised through the issuance\nof confidential supervisory actions, cease and\ndesist orders, civil monetary penalties, or\nother actions.\n\nThere also are a number of obligations and\nrestrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI\nsubsidiaries by federal law and regulatory\npolicy that are designed to reduce potential\nloss exposure to depositors and the DIF in the\nevent the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of\nbecoming insolvent. For example, the FRB\nrequires a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and\nto commit financial resources to support such\ninstitutions in circumstances where it might\nnot do so otherwise.\n\nBanking regulators also have broad supervisory\nand enforcement powers over Truist Bank,\nincluding the power to impose confidential\nsupervisory actions, fines and other civil and\ncriminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver\nin order to conserve the assets of Truist Bank\nfor the benefit of depositors and other\ncreditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to\ntake possession of a North Carolina state bank\nin certain circumstances, including when it\nappears that such bank has violated its\ncharter or any applicable laws, is conducting\nits business in an unauthorized or unsafe\nmanner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition\nto transact its business or has an impairment\nof its capital stock.\n                                              \n  DIF Assessments                             \n                                              \nTruist Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC\nup to the applicable limits, which is\ncurrently $250,000 per account ownership type.\nThe FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium\nassessment system that determines assessment\nrates for an IDI based on an assessment rate\ncalculator, which is based on a number of\nelements to measure the risk each IDI poses to\nthe DIF. The assessment rate is applied to\ntotal average assets less tangible equity, as\ndefined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The\nassessment rate schedule can change from time\nto time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject\nto certain limits. Under the current system,\npremiums are assessed quarterly.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the DIF reserve\nratio was 1.27%. The FDIC, as required under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established\na plan on September 15, 2020, to restore the\nDIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed 1.35%\nwithin eight years. The FDIC's restoration\nplan projects the reserve ratio to exceed\n1.35% without increasing the deposit insurance\nassessment rate, subject to ongoing monitoring\nover the next eight years. The FDIC could\nincrease the deposit insurance assessments for\ncertain insured depository institutions,\nincluding Truist Bank, if the DIF reserve\nratio is not restored as projected.\n                                              \n  Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations    \n                                              \nIn connection with its lending and leasing\nactivities, Truist Bank is subject to a number\nof federal and state laws designed to protect\nborrowers and promote lending to various\nsectors of the economy and population. The\nCFPB examines Truist and Truist Bank for\ncompliance with a broad range of federal\nconsumer financial laws and regulations,\nincluding the laws and regulations that relate\nto deposit products, credit card, mortgage,\nautomobile, student, and other consumer loans,\nand other consumer financial products and\nservices offered. The federal consumer\nfinancial protection laws that are subject to\nthe CFPB's supervision and enforcement powers\ninclude, among others, the Truth in Lending\nAct, Truth in Savings Act, HMDA, Fair Credit\nReporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair\nDebt Collection Practices Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, and Fair Housing Act. The\nCFPB also has authority to take enforcement\nactions to prevent and remedy acts and\npractices relating to consumer financial\nproducts and services that it deems to be\nunfair, deceptive, or abusive, and to impose\nnew disclosure requirements for any consumer\nfinancial product or service.\n\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact\nproducts and services offered by Truist or\nTruist Bank. The regulations could reduce the\nfees that Truist receives, alter the way\nTruist provides its products and services, or\nexpose Truist to greater risk of private\nlitigation or regulatory enforcement action.\n\nDuring November 2019, SunTrust Bank entered\ninto a consent order with the FRB, relating to\ncertain identified legacy compliance issues,\nand requiring certain remediation actions and\nthe verification of such actions regarding the\nidentified issues. In June 2021, the FDIC\nterminated this consent order.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 11\n                                              \n  Patriot Act                                 \n                                              \nThe Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the\nability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and\nintelligence communities to cooperate in the\nprevention, detection, and prosecution of\ninternational money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism. The Patriot Act\ncontains anti-money laundering measures\naffecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain\nother financial institutions. The Patriot Act\nincludes the International Money Laundering\nAbatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of\n2001, which requires such financial\ninstitutions to implement policies and\nprocedures to combat money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism and grants the\nSecretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority\nto establish regulations and to impose\nrequirements and restrictions on financial\ninstitutions' operations. The Patriot Act\nimposes substantial obligations on financial\ninstitutions to maintain appropriate policies,\nprocedures and processes to detect, prevent,\nand report money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and other financial crimes. Failure\nto comply with these regulations may result in\nfines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory\nsanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions\non business. In addition, the Patriot Act\nrequires the federal bank regulatory agencies\nto consider the effectiveness of a financial\ninstitution's anti-money laundering activities\nwhen reviewing bank mergers and BHC\nacquisitions.\n                                              \n  BSA/AML and Sanctions                       \n                                              \nTruist continues to be subject to examinations\nand ongoing monitoring to assess compliance\nwith BSA/AML laws and regulations. These laws\nand regulations are designed to protect the\nfinancial system by requiring financial\ninstitutions to develop and implement BSA/AML\nprograms designed to detect, deter, and\nprevent the use of the financial system to\nfacilitate the funding of illicit and criminal\nactivities. In addition, Truist is also\nsubject to prohibitions with respect to\nengaging in financial transactions with\ncertain individuals, entities, and countries\nas prohibited by the OFAC regulator of the\nU.S. Treasury.\n\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal financial institution\nregulators, OFAC and law enforcement agencies\nwith respect to AML laws and regulations. This\nenforcement authority includes, among other\nthings, the ability to assess significant\ncivil or criminal monetary penalties, fines,\nor restitution; to issue cease and desist or\nremoval orders; and to initiate injunctive\nactions against financial institutions and\ninstitution-affiliated parties. These\nenforcement actions may be initiated for\nviolations of laws and regulations and unsafe\nor unsound practices.\n                                              \n  Privacy, Data Protection, and Cyber         \n  Security                                    \n                                              \nVarious federal and state laws and regulations\ncontain extensive data privacy and\ncybersecurity provisions, and the regulatory\nframework for data privacy and cybersecurity\nis rapidly evolving. The FRB, FDIC, and other\nbank regulatory agencies have adopted\nguidelines for safeguarding confidential,\npersonal customer information. These\nguidelines require each financial institution,\nunder the supervision and ongoing oversight of\nits board of directors or an appropriate\ncommittee thereof, to create, implement, and\nmaintain a comprehensive written information\nsecurity program designed to ensure the\nsecurity and confidentiality of customer\ninformation, protect against any anticipated\nthreats or hazards to the security or\nintegrity of such information and protect\nagainst unauthorized access to or use of such\ninformation that could result in substantial\nharm or inconvenience to any customer. In\naddition, various U.S. regulators, including\nthe FRB and the SEC, have increased their\nfocus on cyber security through guidance,\nexaminations, and regulations.\n\nAt the federal level, the GLBA requires\nfinancial institutions to implement policies\nand procedures regarding the disclosure of\nnonpublic personal information about consumers\nto non-affiliated third parties. In general,\nthe statute requires explanations to consumers\non policies and procedures regarding the\ndisclosure of such nonpublic personal\ninformation and, except as otherwise required\nby law, prohibits disclosing such personal\ninformation except as provided in the banking\nsubsidiary's policies and procedures.\n\nIn addition, in November 2021, the FRB, OCC,\nand FDIC adopted a new regulation that, among\nother things, requires a banking organization\nto notify its primary federal regulators\nwithin 36 hours after identifying a \"computer-\nsecurity incident\" that the banking\norganization believes in good faith could\nmaterially disrupt or degrade its business or\noperations in a manner that would, among other\nthings, jeopardize the viability of its\noperations, result in customers being unable\nto access their deposit and other accounts,\nresult in a material loss of revenue, profit\nor franchise value, or pose a threat to the\nfinancial stability of the U.S.\n\nStates are also increasingly proposing or\nenacting legislation that relates to data\nprivacy and data protection such as the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act which went\ninto effect on January 1, 2020. Truist has\nundertaken significant efforts to comply with\nthese laws and continues to assess their\nrequirements and applicability to Truist.\nThese laws and proposed legislation are still\nsubject to revision or formal guidance and\nthey may be interpreted or applied in a manner\ninconsistent with the Company\u2019s understanding.\nCalifornia voters also recently passed the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, which will take\neffect on January 1, 2023, and significantly\nmodifies the California Consumer Privacy Act,\nincluding by imposing additional obligations\non covered companies and expanding California\nconsumers' rights with respect to certain\nsensitive personal information, potentially\nresulting in further uncertainty and requiring\nTruist to incur additional costs to comply.\nTruist may be subject to similar laws in other\nstates where Truist does business or in states\nwhere Truist may collect personal information\nof residents.\n\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIn addition, the promulgation in 2017 of the\nNew York Department of Financial Services\nCybersecurity Regulation and the National\nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners\nInsurance Data Security Model Law are driving\nsignificant cybersecurity compliance\nactivities for Truist. Both of these\nregulations include phased compliance periods\nas well as attestation of compliance by\nTruist.\n\nLike other lenders, Truist Bank uses credit\nbureau data in its underwriting activities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates\nreporting information to credit bureaus,\nprescreening individuals for credit offers,\nsharing of information between affiliates, and\nusing affiliate data for marketing purposes.\nSimilar state laws may impose additional\nrequirements on Truist Bank. Truist is also\nsubject to rules and regulations issued by the\nFederal Trade Commission, which regulates\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices,\nincluding with respect to data privacy and\ncybersecurity. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has\nrecently considered, and is currently\nconsidering various proposals for more\ncomprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity\nlegislation, to which we may be subject if\npassed.\n                                              \n  CRA                                         \n                                              \nThe CRA requires Truist Bank's primary federal\nbank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess\nthe bank's record in meeting the credit needs\nof the communities served by the bank,\nincluding low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods and persons. Institutions are\nassigned one of four ratings: \"Outstanding,\"\n\"Satisfactory,\" \"Needs to Improve,\" or\n\"Substantial Noncompliance.\" This assessment\nis considered for any bank that applies to\nmerge or consolidate with or acquire the\nassets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or\nto open or relocate a branch office. The CRA\nrecord of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also\nis assessed by the FRB in connection with\nreviewing any proposed acquisition or merger\napplication. In 2021, Truist received the\nhighest possible overall rating of\n\"Outstanding\" from the FDIC for its most\nrecent CRA examination period.\n                                              \n  Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation      \n                                              \nThere are federal consumer protection laws\nrelated to automated overdraft payment\nprograms offered by financial institutions.\nThe CFPB prohibits financial institutions from\ncharging consumers fees for paying overdrafts\non automated teller machine and one-time debit\ncard transactions, unless a consumer consents,\nor opts in, to the overdraft service.\nFinancial institutions must also provide\nconsumers with a notice that explains the\nfinancial institution's overdraft services,\nincluding the associated fees and the\nconsumer's choices. In addition, FDIC-\nsupervised institutions must monitor overdraft\npayment programs for \"excessive or chronic\"\nclient use and undertake \"meaningful and\neffective\" follow-up action with clients that\noverdraw their accounts more than six times\nduring a rolling 12-month period. Financial\ninstitutions must also impose daily limits on\noverdraft charges, review and modify check-\nclearing procedures, prominently distinguish\naccount balances from available overdraft\ncoverage amounts, and ensure board and\nmanagement oversight regarding overdraft\npayment programs. In 2022, Truist announced a\nfirst-of-its-kind approach to the checking\naccount experience, designed to address\nclients\u2019 direct feedback, which includes no\noverdraft fees. Refer to the \u201cExecutive\nOverview\u201d section in MD&A for additional\ninformation on the new program.\n                                              \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nTruist is prohibited under the Volcker Rule\nfrom (i) engaging in proprietary trading\nactivities, and (ii) having certain ownership\ninterests in and relationships with covered\nprivate funds. The fundamental prohibitions of\nthe Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of\nany size, including Truist and its affiliates.\nThe Volcker Rule regulations contain\nexemptions or exclusions for market-making,\nhedging, underwriting, trading in U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations and also\npermit certain ownership interests in certain\ntypes of funds to be retained. They also\npermit the offering and sponsoring of funds\nunder certain conditions. The Volcker Rule\nregulations impose significant compliance\nobligations on banking entities. Truist has\nput in place the compliance programs required\nby the Volcker Rule and has either divested or\nreceived extensions for any holdings in\nilliquid funds.\n\nIn June 2020, the regulatory agencies charged\nwith implementing the Volcker Rule finalized\namendments to the Volcker Rule's restrictions\non ownership interests in and relationships\nwith covered funds. Among other things, these\namendments permit banking entities to have\nrelationships with and offer additional\nfinancial services to additional types of\nfunds and investment vehicles. These\nrequirements are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on Truist\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or\ncash flows.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Regime for Swaps                 \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive\nregulatory regime for the OTC swaps market,\naimed at increasing transparency, and reducing\nsystemic risk in the derivatives markets,\nincluding requirements for central clearing,\nexchange trading, capital adequacy, margin,\nreporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank\nAct requires that certain swap dealers and\nsecurity-based swap dealers register with one\nor both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the\nnature of the swaps business. Truist Bank\nprovisionally registered with the CFTC as a\nswap dealer, subjecting Truist Bank to\nrequirements under the CFTC's regulatory\nregime, including trade reporting and record\nkeeping requirements, business conduct\nrequirements (including daily valuations,\ndisclosure of material risks associated with\nswaps and disclosure of material incentives\nand conflicts of interest), and mandatory\nclearing and exchange trading requirements for\ncertain standardized swaps designated by the\nCFTC.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 13\nIn November 2021, Truist Bank conditionally\nregistered with the SEC as a security-based\nswap dealer. As a result, Truist Bank\u2019s\nsecurity-based swaps business is now subject\nto requirements that are similar to the CFTC\nrules applicable to swap dealers, including\ntrade reporting, business conduct standards,\nrecordkeeping, and potentially clearing and\nexchange trading requirements.\n\nTruist Bank's uncleared swaps and security-\nbased swaps are subject to variation margin\nand initial margin requirements. The variation\nmargin requirements are currently in effect\nand the initial margin requirements are\nphasing in over a period of six years and will\nbe fully phased-in on September 1, 2022,\ndepending on the level of derivatives activity\nof the swap dealer and the relevant\ncounterparty.\n                                              \n  Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser        \n  Regulation                                  \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulation by the\nSEC. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory\norganization for Truist\u2019s registered broker-\ndealer and investment adviser subsidiaries.\nTruist\u2019s broker-dealer and investment adviser\nsubsidiaries also are subject to additional\nregulation by states or local jurisdictions.\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement\nfunctions that oversee broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers and can bring actions that\nresult in fines, restitution, a limitation on\npermitted activities, disqualification to\ncontinue to conduct certain activities and an\ninability to rely on certain favorable\nexemptions. Certain types of infractions and\nviolations also can affect Truist\u2019s ability to\nissue new securities expeditiously. In\naddition, certain changes in the activities of\na broker-dealer require approval from FINRA,\nand FINRA takes into account a variety of\nconsiderations in acting upon applications for\nsuch approval, including internal controls,\ncapital levels, management experience and\nquality, prior enforcement and disciplinary\nhistory, and supervisory concerns.\n\nIn June 2019, the SEC finalized Regulation\nBest Interest, which imposes a new standard of\nconduct on SEC-registered broker-dealers when\nmaking recommendations to retail customers. In\naddition, the SEC finalized a new summary\ndisclosure form that broker-dealers and\ninvestment advisers must provide to retail\ncustomers. Truist\u2019s broker-dealer and\ninvestment adviser subsidiaries were required\nto comply with these requirements, as\napplicable, as of June 2020.\n                                              \n  FDIC Recordkeeping Requirements             \n                                              \nTo facilitate prompt payment of FDIC-insured\ndeposits when large IDIs fail, FDIC rules\nrequire IDIs with two million or more deposit\naccounts to maintain complete and accurate\ndata on each depositor's ownership interest by\nright and capacity and to develop the\ncapability to calculate the insured and\nuninsured amounts for each deposit owner by\nownership right and capacity. Compliance with\nthe rule was originally required by April 1,\n2020. Truist became subject to the rules\nrelated to recordkeeping requirements and\ntimely deposit insurance as of April 1, 2021,\nunder the optional one-year extension.\n                                              \n  Other Regulatory Matters                    \n                                              \nTruist is subject to examinations by federal\nand state banking regulators, as well as the\nSEC, CFTC, FINRA, NYSE, various taxing\nauthorities, and various state insurance and\nsecurities regulators. Truist periodically\nreceives requests for information on business\nand accounting practices from regulatory\nauthorities in various states, including state\ninsurance commissions and state attorneys\ngeneral, securities regulators, and other\nregulatory authorities.

When a risk factor spans\nseveral risk categories, the risks have been\nlisted by their primary risk category. The\nrisks described are not all inclusive.\nAdditional risks that are not presently known\nor risks deemed immaterial may have a material\nadverse effect on Truist's financial\ncondition, results of operations, business,\nand prospects.\n                                              \n  Merger-Related Risks                        \n                                              \nTruist may not be able to successfully\nintegrate the companies or to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the Merger.\n\nThe Company was formed by the Merger of BB&T\nand SunTrust on December 6, 2019. Since the\nclosing of the Merger, Truist has expended\nsignificant time and resources, and incurred\nsubstantial expenses, in the integration of\nsystems, operations, and teammates of BB&T and\nSunTrust. Although many integration milestones\nhave been achieved, important integration\nsteps remain to be completed. In addition, the\ncore bank conversion of heritage SunTrust\nclients occurred in February 2022. Conversion\nactivities remain subject to validation, and\nissues related to this and other conversions\nmay not be discovered until a later date.\nAdditionally, systems that are no longer being\nused may still need to be retained for a\nperiod of time.\n\n20 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist may encounter difficulties as it\ncompletes integration activities, such as:\n\n\u2022 the loss of key teammates and clients;\n\n\u2022 the disruption of operations and businesses;\n\n\u2022 loan, deposit, and revenue attrition;\n\n\u2022 inconsistencies in standards, control\nprocedures and policies;\n\n\u2022 unexpected issues with planned branch and\nother facilities closures;\n\n\u2022 unexpected issues with costs, operations,\nteammates, technology; and\n\n\u2022 problems with the assimilation of new\noperations, sites, or teammates.\n\nIntegration activities have and will continue\nto divert resources from regular operations.\nIn addition, general market and economic\nconditions or governmental actions affecting\nthe financial industry may inhibit the\nCompany\u2019s continued integration of the\nheritage entities.\n\nBB&T and SunTrust merged with the expectation\nthat the Merger would result in various\nsynergies, including benefits relating to\nenhanced revenues, a strengthened and expanded\nmarket position for the combined organization,\ntechnology efficiencies, cost savings, and\noperating efficiencies. Achieving the\nanticipated benefits of the Merger is subject\nto a number of uncertainties, including\nwhether the Company continues the integration\nof the institutions in an efficient and\neffective manner, as well as general\ncompetitive factors in the marketplace.\nFailure to achieve or delays in achieving\nthese anticipated benefits could result in a\nshare price reduction as well as increased\ncosts, decreases in the amount of expected\nrevenues, and diversion of management's time\nand energy and could materially and adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s financial condition,\nresults of operations, business and prospects.\n\nTruist will continue to incur substantial\nexpenses related to the Merger and the\nintegration.\n\nThere continue to be processes, policies,\nprocedures, operations, technologies, and\nsystems that must be integrated or\ndecommissioned. In addition, the Merger may\nincrease the Company\u2019s compliance and legal\nrisks, including increased litigation or\nregulatory actions such as fines or\nrestrictions related to the business practices\nor operations of the combined business.\n\nWhile the Company has assumed that a certain\nlevel of expenses would be incurred, there are\nmany factors beyond the Company\u2019s control that\ncould affect the total amount or the timing of\nthe integration expenses. Moreover, many of\nthe expenses that will be incurred are, by\ntheir nature, difficult to estimate\naccurately. The amount and timing of future\ncharges to earnings as a result of Merger or\nintegration expenses remain uncertain.\n                                              \n  COVID-19 Risks                              \n                                              \nThe effects of COVID-19 have adversely\nimpacted the Company\u2019s operations; the\nduration and impact of these effects is still\nunknown.\n\nAlthough the global economy has begun to\nrecover from the COVID-19 pandemic, as many\nhealth and safety restrictions have been\nlifted and vaccine distribution has increased,\ncertain adverse consequences of the pandemic\ncontinue to impact the macroeconomic\nenvironment and may persist, including labor\nshortages and disruptions of global supply\nchains. The growth in economic activity and\ndemand for goods and services, alongside labor\nshortages and supply chain complications, has\nalso contributed to rising inflationary\npressures.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the majority\nof the Company\u2019s workforce has been working\nremotely, which may increase cybersecurity\nrisks to the Company. Commercial clients are\nexperiencing varying levels of disruptions or\nrestrictions on their business activity and\nsupply chains, closures of facilities or\ndecreases in demand for their products and\nservices. Consumer clients are experiencing\ninterrupted income or unemployment. Certain\nindustries have been particularly susceptible\nto the effects of the pandemic, including\nindustries where Truist has outstanding loans\nto clients. The duration of this severe\neconomic disruption and its related financial\nimpact cannot be reasonably estimated at this\ntime.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic initially resulted\nin an increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses, a reduction of fee income, a reduction\nof net interest margin, a decrease in demand\nfor certain types of loans, and an increase in\nexpenses. A resurgence of the pandemic could\nreintroduce or continue to worsen these\nimpacts and also affect the Company\u2019s capital\nand liquidity position, impair the ability of\nborrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair\nthe value of collateral securing loans, cause\nan outflow of deposits, influence the\nrecognition of credit losses on loans and\nsecurities and further increase the allowance\nfor credit losses, result in additional lost\nrevenue, cause additional increases in\nexpenses, result in goodwill impairment\ncharges, result in the impairment of other\nfinancial and nonfinancial assets, and\nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of capital.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 21\nSince the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic\ngovernmental authorities enacted regulations,\nand protocols, including governmental programs\nto provide economic relief to businesses and\nindividuals. The application of forbearance\nand payment deferral policies beyond any\nstatutory requirements may impact Truist\u2019s\ninterest income. Truist participated in the\nSBA's PPP as an eligible lender with the\nbenefit of a government guaranty of loans to\nsmall business clients, many of whom may face\ndifficulties even after being granted such a\nloan. The Company faces increased risks, in\nterms of credit, fraud risk, and litigation,\nin light of participation in this program.\n\nThe extent to which the consequences of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic affect the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition, results of operation, and\nliquidity and capital position will depend on\nfuture developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted, including\nthe rate of distribution and administration of\nvaccines globally, the severity and duration\nof any resurgence of COVID-19 variants, future\nactions taken by governmental authorities,\ncentral banks and other third parties in\nresponse to the pandemic, and the effects on\ncustomers, counterparties, employees and\nthird-party service providers. Moreover, the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten\nthe other risks described in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Climate Risks                               \n                                              \nPhysical, transition, or other risks\nassociated with climate change have the\npotential to negatively impact operations,\nbusiness results, and clients.\n\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks\nof climate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters. Climate change\npresents (i) physical risks from the direct\nimpacts of changing climate patterns and acute\nweather events, such as damage to physical\nassets and service disruptions, and (ii)\ntransition risks from changes in regulations,\ndisruptive technologies, and shifting market\ndynamics towards a lower carbon economy. The\nphysical risks of climate change include\ndiscrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes,\ntornadoes, and wildfires, and longer-term\nshifts in climate patterns, such as extreme\nheat, sea level rise, and more frequent and\nprolonged drought. Physical risks may alter\nthe Company\u2019s strategic direction in order to\nmitigate certain financial risks. Such events\ncould also disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or\nthose of its clients or third parties the\nCompany relies on, not only through direct\ndamage to assets, but also from indirect\nimpacts due to supply chain disruption and\nmarket volatility. While material impact from\nclimate change is expected to occur over a\nlonger time horizon, the acceleration of a\ntransition to a low-carbon economy could\npresent idiosyncratic risks for individual\ncompanies. Additionally, transitioning to a\nlow-carbon economy will entail extensive\npolicy, legal, technology, and market\ninitiatives.\n\nTransition risks, including changes in\nconsumer preferences, additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes and additional\ncounterparty or customer requirements, could\nhave a material adverse impact on asset values\nand the financial performance of Truist\u2019s\nbusinesses, and those of its clients. Climate\nchange could also present incremental risks to\nthe execution of the Company\u2019s long-term\nstrategy.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces potential\nreputational risks as a result of its\npractices related to climate change, including\nas a result of the Company\u2019s direct or\nindirect involvement in certain industries, as\nwell as any decisions management makes in\nresponse to managing climate risk. As climate\nrisk is interconnected with all key risk\ntypes, Truist continues to embed climate risk\nconsiderations into risk management\nstrategies. Due to the level of uncertainty\naround the future path of climate change, the\nCompany\u2019s risk management strategies may not\nbe effective in fully mitigating climate risk\nexposures.\n                                              \n  Market Risks                                \n                                              \nChanges in interest rates could adversely\naffect revenue and expenses, the value of\nassets and liabilities, as well as the\navailability and cost of capital, and\nliquidity.\n\nTruist\u2019s balance sheet can be sensitive to\nmovements in market interest rates and\nspreads. In addition to the impact of the\ngeneral economy, changes in interest rates or\nin valuations in the debt or equity markets\ncould directly impact the Company in one or\nmore of the following ways:\n\n\u2022 The yield on earning assets and rates paid\non interest-bearing liabilities may change in\ndisproportionate ways; or\n\n\u2022 The value of financial instruments held\ncould change adversely.\n\nRegional and local economic conditions,\ncompetitive pressures and the policies of\nregulatory authorities affect interest income\nand interest expense. When interest rates\nrise, funding costs may rise faster than the\nyield the Company earns on assets, causing\ninterest margin to contract. Higher interest\nrates may also result in lower mortgage\nproduction income and elevated charge-offs in\ncertain categories of the loan portfolio.\nConversely, when interest rates fall, the\nyield the Company earns on assets may fall\nfaster than the Company\u2019s ability to lower\nrates paid on deposits or borrowings.\n\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCertain investment securities, notably MBS,\nare very sensitive to changes in rates.\nGenerally, when rates rise, prepayments will\ndecrease and the duration of MBS will\nincrease. Conversely, when rates fall,\nprepayments of principal and interest will\nincrease and the duration of MBS will\ndecrease.\n\nThe monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S.\nfederal government could have a material\nadverse effect on profitability.\n\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies,\nincluding FRB policies, can adversely affect\nprofitability and cannot be controlled or\npredicted by the Company. FRB policies can:\n\n\u2022 significantly impact the cost of funds, as\nwell as the return on assets, both of which\ncan have an impact on interest income;\n\n\u2022 materially affect the value of financial\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect borrowers through higher\ndebt servicing costs and potentially increase\nthe risk that they may fail to repay their\nloan obligations; and\n\n\u2022 artificially inflate asset values during\nprolonged periods of accommodative policy,\nwhich could in turn cause volatile markets and\nrapidly declining collateral values during\ntimes of restrictive monetary and fiscal\npolicies.\n\nWhile interest rates remain low, the FRB is\nexpected to begin raising interest rates\nduring 2022. Truist cannot predict the nature\nor timing of future changes in monetary\npolicies or the precise effects that they may\nhave on the Company\u2019s activities and financial\nresults.\n\nElevated inflation and expectations for\nelevated future inflation can adversely impact\neconomic growth, consumer and business\nconfidence, and the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results. In addition, elevated\ninflation may cause unexpected changes in\nmonetary policies and actions which may\nadversely affect confidence, the economy, and\nthe Company\u2019s financial condition and results.\n\nFinancial results, lending or other business\nactivities could be materially affected by a\ndeterioration of economic conditions.\n\nA prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S.\neconomy as a whole or in any regional markets\nthat Truist serves, or any deterioration in\neconomic conditions or the financial markets\nmay disrupt or dampen the economy, which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results.\n\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, the\nCompany may see lower demand for loans by\ncreditworthy clients, reducing the Company\u2019s\ninterest income. In addition, if unemployment\nlevels increase or if real estate prices\ndecrease, the Company would expect to incur\nhigher charge-offs and may incur higher\nexpenses in connection with adjustments to the\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used to\nestimate the allowance for credit losses in\naccordance with CECL requirements. These\nconditions may adversely affect not only\nconsumer loan performance but also commercial\nand industrial and commercial real estate\nloans, especially for those businesses that\nrely on the health of industries or properties\nthat may suffer from deteriorating economic\nconditions. The ability of these borrowers to\nrepay their loans may be reduced, causing the\nCompany to incur higher credit losses.\n\nThe deterioration of economic conditions also\ncould adversely affect financial results for\nthe Company\u2019s fee-based businesses. Truist\nearns fee income from, among other activities,\nmanaging assets for clients, and providing\nbrokerage and other investment advisory and\nwealth management services. Investment\nmanagement fees are often based on the value\nof assets under management and a decrease in\nthe market prices of those assets could reduce\nthe Company\u2019s fee income. Changes in stock or\nfixed income market prices or client\npreferences could affect the trading activity\nof investors, reducing commissions and other\nfees earned from the Company\u2019s brokerage\nbusiness. Poor economic conditions and\nvolatile or unstable financial markets would\nlikely adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital\nmarkets-related businesses.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nInstability in global economic conditions and\ngeopolitical matters, as well as volatility in\nfinancial markets, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition. The\nmacroeconomic environment in the United States\nis susceptible to global events and volatility\nin financial markets. For example, trade\nnegotiations between the U.S. and other\nnations remains uncertain and could adversely\nimpact economic and market conditions for the\nCompany and its clients and counterparties. In\naddition, global demand for products may\nexceed supply during the economic recovery\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, and such shortages\nmay cause inflation, adversely impact consumer\nand business confidence, and adversely affect\nthe economy as well as the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 23\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely\naffect Truist\u2019s profitability and financial\ncondition.\n\nLIBOR and certain other interest rate\nbenchmarks are the subject of recent national,\ninternational, and other regulatory guidance\nand proposals for reform. These reforms have\ncaused and may continue to cause such\nbenchmarks to perform differently than in the\npast, disappear entirely, or have other\nconsequences which cannot be predicted.\n\nA transition away from the widespread use of\nLIBOR to alternative rates and other potential\ninterest rate benchmark reforms will continue\nover the course of the next few years. The\npublication of the one-week and two-month U.S.\ndollar LIBOR settings ceased as of December\n31, 2021, while certain U.S. dollar LIBOR\ntenors are expected to continue to be\npublished until June 30, 2023. The U.S.\nfederal banking agencies have encouraged banks\nto cease entering into new contracts that use\nU.S. dollar LIBOR by December 31, 2021.\n\nA group of market participants convened by the\nFRB, the ARRC, has selected SOFR as its\nrecommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nTruist offers SOFR-based lending solutions to\nwholesale and consumer clients, and enters\ninto SOFR-based derivative contracts. Truist\nwill also support \u201ccredit sensitive\u201d\nalternatives, such as Bloomberg Short Term\nBank Yield and other alternatives as they\ndevelop in the market. At this time, it is\nimpossible to predict whether SOFR will become\nan accepted alternative to LIBOR.\n\nSOFR or other alternative reference rates may\nperform differently than LIBOR in response to\nchanging market conditions. For example, SOFR\ncould experience greater decreases during\ntimes of economic stress, which could require\nthe Company to lend at lower rates at times\nwhen the Company\u2019s borrowing costs are\nincreasing.\n\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to\nalternative reference rates is complex and\ncould have a range of adverse effects on the\nCompany\u2019s business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. In particular, any such\ntransition could:\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates received\nor paid on the revenue and expenses associated\nwith or the value of the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based\nassets and liabilities;\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates received\nor paid on the revenue and expenses associated\nwith or the value of other securities or\nfinancial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in\ndetermining market interest rates globally;\n\n\u2022 prompt inquiries or other actions from\nregulators in respect of the Company\u2019s\npreparation and readiness for the replacement\nof LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\nand\n\n\u2022 result in disputes, litigation, or other\nactions with borrowers or counterparties about\nthe interpretation and enforceability of\ncertain fallback language in LIBOR-based\ncontracts and securities.\n\nThe transition away from LIBOR to an\nalternative reference rate or rates will\nrequire the transition to or development of\nappropriate systems, models, and analytics to\neffectively transition the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement and other processes from LIBOR-\nbased products to those based on the\napplicable alternative reference rate, such as\nSOFR. Truist has developed a LIBOR transition\nteam and project plan that outlines timelines\nand priorities to prepare its processes,\nsystems, and people to support this\ntransition. There can be no guarantee that\nthese efforts will successfully mitigate the\noperational risks associated with the\ntransition away from LIBOR to an alternative\nreference rate.\n\nThe manner and impact of the transition from\nLIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as\nwell as the effect of these developments on\nthe Company\u2019s funding costs, loan, investment\nand trading securities portfolios, and ALM, is\nuncertain.\n                                              \n  Credit Risks                                \n                                              \nThe Company is subject to credit risk by\nlending or committing to lend money, or\nentering into a letter of credit or other\ntypes of contracts with counterparties.\n\nTruist incurs credit risk, which is the risk\nof loss if the Company\u2019s borrowers or\ncounterparties fail to perform according to\nthe terms of their contracts. A number of\nproducts expose the Company to credit risk,\nincluding loans and leases, lending\ncommitments, derivatives, trading assets and\ninvestment securities. Changes in credit\nquality can have a significant impact on the\nCompany\u2019s earnings and capital position. The\nCompany estimates and establishes contractual\nlifetime reserves for credit risks and credit\nlosses inherent in its determination of credit\nexposure. This process, which is critical to\nthe Company\u2019s financial results and condition,\nrequires complex calculations and extensive\nuse of judgment, considering both external and\nborrower-specific factors that might impair\nthe ability of borrowers to repay their loans.\nAs is the case with any such assessments,\nthere is always the chance that the Company\nwill fail to identify all pertinent factors or\nthat the Company will fail to accurately\nestimate the impacts of factors identified.\n\nCredit losses may exceed the amount of the\nCompany\u2019s reserves as a result of changing\neconomic conditions, including falling real\nestate or commodity prices and higher\nunemployment or other factors such as changes\nin borrower behavior. There is no assurance\nthat reserves will be sufficient to cover all\ncredit losses. In the event of significant\ndeterioration in current or projected future\neconomic conditions, the Company may be\nrequired to increase reserves in future\nperiods, which would reduce the Company\u2019s\nearnings and potentially impact its capital.\n\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company may have more credit risk and\nhigher credit losses to the extent that loans\nare concentrated by loan type, industry\nsegment, borrower type, or location of the\nborrower or collateral.\n\nThe Company\u2019s credit risk and credit losses\ncan increase if the Company\u2019s loans are\nconcentrated in borrowers engaged in the same\nor similar activities or in borrowers who as a\ngroup may be uniquely or disproportionately\naffected by economic, market conditions, or\nclimate change.\n\nDeterioration in economic conditions, housing\nconditions, or real estate values, including\nas a result of climate change or natural\ndisasters, in the markets in which the Company\noperates could result in materially higher\ncredit losses. The Company is also subject to\nphysical risks of climate change, which could\nmanifest in the form of asset quality\ndeterioration and could be exacerbated by\nspecific portfolio concentrations, and\ntransition risks of climate change, which\ncould manifest through longer-term shifts in\nmarket dynamics and consumer preferences and\ncould be exacerbated in specific industries\nthat may be more sensitive or vulnerable to a\ntransition to a low carbon economy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risks                             \n                                              \nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix\ncould increase Truist\u2019s funding costs.\n\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of\nfunding. Truist competes with banks and other\nfinancial institutions for deposits and as a\nresult, could lose deposits in the future or\nsee an increase in costs associated with\nmaintaining deposits. Clients may shift their\ndeposits into higher cost products or the\nCompany may need to raise interest rates to\navoid deposit attrition. Funding costs may\nalso increase if deposits lost are replaced\nwith wholesale funding. Higher funding costs\nreduce Truist\u2019s net interest margin, net\ninterest income, and net income.\n\nTruist\u2019s liquidity could be impaired by an\ninability to access short-term funding, an\nunforeseen outflow of cash, or the inability\nto monetize liquid assets.\n\nLiquidity is essential to Truist\u2019s businesses.\nWhen volatility or disruptions occur in the\nwholesale funding markets, the Company\u2019s\nability to access short-term liquidity could\nbe materially impaired. In addition,\nidiosyncratic factors, as well as other\nfactors outside of the Company\u2019s control, such\nas a general market disruption or an\noperational problem that affects third\nparties, could impair the Company\u2019s ability to\naccess short-term funding or create an\nunforeseen outflow of cash due to, among other\nfactors, draws on unfunded commitments or\ndeposit attrition. The Company\u2019s inability to\nmonetize liquid assets or to access short-term\nfunding or capital markets could constrain the\nCompany\u2019s ability to make new loans or meet\nexisting lending commitments and could\nultimately jeopardize the Company\u2019s overall\nliquidity and capitalization.\n\nTruist relies on the mortgage secondary market\nand GSEs for some of the Company\u2019s liquidity.\n\nTruist sells a portion of the mortgage loans\nthat it originates to reduce the Company\u2019s\nretained credit risk and to provide funding\ncapacity for originating additional loans.\nGSEs could limit their purchases of conforming\nloans due to capital constraints or other\nchanges in their criteria for conforming loans\n(e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower\neligibility). This potential reduction in\npurchases could limit the Company\u2019s ability to\nfund new loans.\n\nProposals have been presented to reform the\nhousing finance market in the U.S., including\nthe role of the GSEs in the housing finance\nmarket. The extent and timing of any such\nregulatory reform of the housing finance\nmarket and the GSEs, as well as any effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business and financial results,\nare uncertain.\n\nAny reduction in the Company\u2019s credit ratings\ncould increase the Company\u2019s cost of funding\nor reduce its access to the capital markets.\n\nCredit ratings are influenced by many factors,\nincluding the Company\u2019s profitability, asset\nquality, capital levels, liquidity, business\nmix, operations, and risk management\npractices. Credit ratings may also be\ninfluenced by other factors, some of which are\noutside the Company\u2019s control, such as recent\nand anticipated economic trends, geopolitical\nrisk, legislative and regulatory developments,\nincluding implied levels of government support\nduring a crisis, environmental, social, and\ngovernance considerations, and litigation, as\nwell as changes to the rating agencies\u2019\nmethodologies, among others. Truist\u2019s failure\nto maintain credit ratings could adversely\naffect funding costs and increase the\nCompany\u2019s cost of capital. A downgrade to\nTruist\u2019s credit ratings might also adversely\nimpact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct\nderivatives business with certain clients and\ncounterparties and could trigger obligations\nto make cash or collateral payments to certain\nclients and counterparties. Additionally, a\nratings downgrade could affect the Company\u2019s\nability to attract or retain funding,\nincluding deposits from commercial and\ncorporate clients.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 25\nThe Parent Company could have less access to\nfunding sources and its liquidity could be\nconstrained if the Bank becomes unable to pay\ndividends during a time of stress.\n\nThe Parent Company relies upon capital markets\naccess and dividends from affiliates for\nfunding and has less access to contingent\nfunding sources than the Bank. If the Bank\nwere subject to a financial stress, its\ndividends to the Parent Company could be\nreduced or eliminated in order to support Bank\ncapital ratios or other regulatory\nrequirements. This would increase the Parent\nCompany\u2019s reliance on capital markets at a\ntime when spreads and funding costs are likely\nelevated due the stress impacting the Bank.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risks                            \n                                              \nTruist is subject to extensive and evolving\ngovernment regulation and supervision, which\ncould increase the cost of doing business,\nlimit Truist\u2019s ability to make investments and\ngenerate revenue, and lead to costly\nenforcement actions.\n\nThe banking and financial services industries\nare highly regulated. Truist is subject to\nsupervision, regulation, and examination by\nregulators, including the FRB, FDIC, NCCOB,\nSEC, CFTC, CFPB, FINRA, NFA, and various state\nregulatory agencies. The statutory and\nregulatory framework governing Truist is\ngenerally intended to protect depositors, the\nDIF, clients, and the U.S. financial system as\na whole, and not Truist\u2019s debt holders or\nshareholders. Reform of the financial services\nindustry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act,\nincluding the EGRRCPA and other legislative,\nregulatory, and technological changes, affect\nthe Company\u2019s operations.\n\nThese laws and regulations and Truist's\ninability to act in certain instances without\nreceiving prior regulatory approval affect\nTruist\u2019s lending practices, capital structure,\ninvestment practices, dividend policy, ability\nto repurchase common stock and ability to\npursue strategic acquisitions, among other\nactivities. Changes to statutes, regulations\nor regulatory policies or their interpretation\nor implementation and the continued\nheightening of regulatory requirements could\naffect Truist in substantial and unpredictable\nways. Federal and state banking regulators\nalso possess broad powers to take supervisory\nactions as they deem appropriate. These\nsupervisory actions may result in higher\ncapital requirements, higher deposit insurance\npremiums, and limitations on the Company\u2019s\nactivities that could have a material adverse\neffect on operations or profitability.\n\nIn recent years, both Congress and the federal\nbanking regulators have engaged in a\nrebalancing of the post financial crisis legal\nand regulatory framework, particularly by\ntailoring enhanced prudential standards to the\nsize, risk profile, and complexity of the\nbanking organization. Under the current\npresidential administration and Congress, the\nCompany and other large financial institutions\nare becoming subject to increased scrutiny,\nmore intense supervision and regulation, and a\nhigher risk of enforcement action. Truist\nexpects that its businesses will remain\nsubject to extensive regulation and\nsupervision. Any potential new regulations or\nmodifications to existing regulations would\nlikely necessitate changes to Truist\u2019s\nexisting regulatory compliance and risk\nmanagement infrastructure. Compliance with new\nregulations and supervisory initiatives may\nincrease costs. In addition, concerns over\nclimate change may prompt changes in\nregulations that, in turn, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on asset values and\nthe financial performance of Truist\u2019s\nbusinesses and its clients.\n\nTruist is subject to heightened requirements\nunder the enhanced prudential standards and\nexpects increased supervisory scrutiny,\nincluding, for example, single counterparty\ncredit limits, heightened expectations with\nrespect to governance, risk management and\ninternal controls and additional capital and\nliquidity requirements.\n\nFinancial regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad power\nand discretion to direct Truist\u2019s actions, and\nthey have assumed an active oversight,\nexamination, and enforcement role across the\nfinancial services industry on both the\nfederal and state levels. Areas of focus in\nthe recent past have been with respect to\nmortgage-related practices, student lending\npractices, auto lending practices, sales\npractices and related incentive compensation\nprograms, consumer privacy, fair banking,\noverdraft fees, and other consumer compliance\nmatters. During November 2019, SunTrust Bank\nentered into a consent order with the FRB,\nrelating to certain identified legacy\ncompliance issues, and requiring certain\nremediation actions and the verification of\nsuch actions regarding the identified issues.\nIn June 2021, the FDIC terminated this consent\norder. Truist continues to be subject to\nexaminations and ongoing monitoring to assess\ncompliance with BSA/AML laws and regulations,\nas well as sanctions compliance administered\nby the OFAC. Additionally, misconduct by\nteammates, including unethical, fraudulent,\nimproper, or illegal conduct, or other unfair,\ndeceptive, abusive, or discriminatory\npractices, can result in litigation, or\ngovernment investigations and enforcement\nactions, and cause significant reputational\nharm. See additional disclosures in the\n\"Regulatory Considerations\" section.\n\n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company is subject to laws, rules, and\nregulations regarding compliance with privacy\npolicies and the disclosure, collection, use,\nsharing and safeguarding of personal\nidentifiable information of certain parties.\nThere has recently been an increase in\nlegislative and regulatory efforts to protect\nthe privacy of consumer data. Truist will\nlikely be subject to new and evolving data\nprivacy laws in the U.S. and abroad, which\ncould result in additional costs of\ncompliance, litigation, regulatory fines, and\nenforcement actions. These laws may limit how\ncompanies can use customer data and may\nincrease compliance complexity and related\ncosts, result in significant financial\npenalties for compliance failures, and limit\nthe Company\u2019s ability to develop new products\nor respond to technological changes. Truist\nalso relies upon third parties who may expose\nthe Company to compliance and legal risk. New\nor existing legal requirements also could\nheighten the reputational impact of perceived\nmisuses of customer data by the Company and\nthird parties.\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny or the results\nof an investigation or examination may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. There is no assurance\nthat those actions will not result in\nregulatory settlements or other enforcement\nactions against Truist. Furthermore, a single\nevent involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings,\neither by multiple federal and state agencies\nand officials in the United States or, in some\ninstances, regulators and other governmental\nofficials in foreign jurisdictions. In\naddition, if another financial institution is\nfound to have violated a law or regulation\nrelating to certain business activities, this\ncould lead to investigations by regulators or\nother governmental agencies of the same or\nsimilar activities by other financial\ninstitution, including Truist. Responding to\ninquiries, investigations, lawsuits, and\nproceedings is time-consuming and expensive\nand can divert senior management attention\nfrom Truist\u2019s business. The outcome of such\nproceedings, which may last a number of years,\nmay be difficult to predict or estimate.\n\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement\npowers to federal banking regulators and law\nenforcement agencies. This enforcement\nauthority includes, among other things, the\nability to assess significant civil or\ncriminal monetary penalties, fines, or\nrestitution; to issue cease and desist or\nremoval orders; and to initiate injunctive\nactions against banking organizations and\ninstitution-affiliated parties. These\nenforcement actions may be initiated for\nviolations of laws and regulations and unsafe\nor unsound practices.\n\nA failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements and expectations could expose the\nCompany to fines, regulatory penalties, other\ncosts, reputational damage and regulatory or\nenforcement actions, such as limitations on\nengaging in new activities or expanding\ngeographically. In some cases, governmental\nauthorities have required criminal pleas or\nother extraordinary terms as part of such\nsettlements, which could have significant\nconsequences for a financial institution,\nincluding loss of clients, restrictions on the\nability to access the capital markets and the\ninability to operate certain businesses or\noffer certain products for a period of time.\nViolations of laws and regulations or deemed\ndeficiencies in risk management practices also\nmay be incorporated into Truist\u2019s confidential\nsupervisory ratings. A downgrade in these\nratings or these or other regulatory actions\nand settlements, could limit Truist\u2019s ability\nto conduct expansionary activities for a\nperiod of time and require new or additional\nregulatory approvals before engaging in\ncertain other business activities. Any future\nenforcement action could have a material\nadverse impact.\n\nTruist could become subject to future\nlegislation and regulatory requirements beyond\nthose currently proposed, adopted, or\ncontemplated, including policies and\nrulemaking related to Dodd-Frank Act, limits\non acquisitions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nclimate change. The cumulative effect of such\nlegislation and regulations on Truist\u2019s\u2019\nbusiness, operations, and profitability\nremains uncertain. Such regulatory changes may\nreduce Truist\u2019s revenues, limit the types of\nfinancial services and products it may offer,\nalter the investments it makes, affect the\nmanner in which it operates its businesses,\nincrease its litigation and regulatory costs\nshould it fail to appropriately comply with\nnew or modified laws and regulatory\nrequirements and increase the ability of non-\nbanks to offer competing financial services\nand products.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity standards that affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, operations, and ability to pay\ndividends, or otherwise return capital to\nshareholders.\n\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements established by the FRB\nand the FDIC. These regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements are typically developed\nat an international level by the BCBS and then\napplied, with adjustments, in each country by\nthe appropriate domestic regulatory bodies.\nDomestic regulatory agencies have the ability\nto apply stricter capital and liquidity\nstandards than those developed by the BCBS. In\nseveral instances, the U.S. banking agencies\nhave done so with respect to U.S. banking\norganizations.\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of\ncapital and liquidity and regulatory\nexpectations as to the quality of the\nCompany\u2019s capital and liquidity may prevent\nthe Company from taking advantage of\nopportunities in the best interest of\nshareholders or force the Company to take\nactions contrary to their interests. For\nexample, Truist may be limited in its ability\nto pay or increase dividends or otherwise\nreturn capital to shareholders. In addition,\nthese requirements may impact the amount and\ntype of loans the Company is able to make.\nTruist may be constrained in its ability to\nexpand, either organically or through mergers\nand acquisitions. These requirements may cause\nthe Company to sell or refrain from acquiring\nassets where the capital requirements appear\ninconsistent with the assets' underlying\nrisks. In addition, liquidity standards\nrequire the Company to maintain holdings of\nhighly liquid investments, thereby reducing\nthe Company\u2019s ability to invest in less liquid\nassets, even if more desirable from a balance\nsheet or interest rate risk management\nperspective. As a Category III banking\norganization, Truist is subject to additional\ncapital and liquidity requirements.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 27\nThe liquidity standards applicable to large\nU.S. banking organizations have been\nsupplemented in recent years. The NSFR rule,\nwhich is designed to ensure that banking\norganizations maintain a stable funding\nprofile in relation to their asset composition\nand off-balance sheet activities, became\neffective on July 1, 2021. Public disclosure\nof the NSFR will begin in 2023.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory capital and\nliquidity requirements applicable to Truist\nand Truist Bank, the Company\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to capital\nrequirements established by the SEC.\n\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nreceive periodic review and revision by the\nBCBS and the U.S. banking agencies. Changes to\ncapital and liquidity requirements may require\nTruist or Truist Bank to maintain more or\nhigher quality capital or greater liquidity\nand could increase some of the potential\nadverse effects described above.\n\nTruist is subject to certain risks related to\noriginating and selling mortgages and may be\nrequired to repurchase mortgage loans or\nindemnify mortgage loan purchasers.\n\nTruist is required to make customary\nrepresentations and warranties to the\npurchaser about the mortgage loans and the\nmanner in which they were originated when\nselling mortgage loans or loan\nsecuritizations. An increase in the number of\nrepurchase and indemnity demands from\npurchasers related to representations and\nwarranties on loans sold could result in an\nincrease in the amount of losses for loan\nrepurchases. Truist also bears a risk of loss\nfrom borrower defaults for multi-family\ncommercial mortgage loans sold to FNMA.\n\nIn addition to repurchase claims from GSEs,\nTruist could be subject to indemnification\nclaims from non-GSE purchasers of the\nCompany\u2019s loans. Claims could be made if\nTruist fails to conform to statements about\nthe quality of the mortgage loans sold, the\nmanner in which the loans were originated and\nunderwritten or their compliance with state\nand federal law.\n\nTruist faces risks as a servicer of loans.\n\nThe Company acts as servicer and master\nservicer for mortgage loans included in\nsecuritizations and for unsecuritized mortgage\nloans owned by investors. As a servicer or\nmaster servicer for those loans, the Company\nhas certain contractual obligations to the\nsecuritization trusts, investors, or other\nthird parties. As a servicer, Truist\u2019s\nobligations include foreclosing on defaulted\nmortgage loans or, to the extent consistent\nwith the applicable securitization or other\ninvestor agreement, considering alternatives\nto foreclosure such as loan modifications or\nshort sales. In the Company\u2019s capacity as a\nmaster servicer, obligations include\noverseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by\nthe servicer. Generally, the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations are set by contract, for\nwhich the Company receives a contractual fee.\nHowever, GSEs can amend their servicing\nguidelines, which can increase the scope or\ncosts of the services required without any\ncorresponding increase in the Company\u2019s\nservicing fee. Further, the CFPB has\nimplemented national servicing standards which\nhave increased the scope and costs of services\nwhich the Company is required to perform. In\naddition, there has been a significant\nincrease in state laws that impose additional\nservicing requirements that increase the scope\nand cost of the Company\u2019s servicing\nobligations. As a servicer, the Company also\nadvances expenses on behalf of investors which\nit may be unable to collect.\n\nA material breach of the Company\u2019s obligations\nas servicer or master servicer may result in\ncontract termination if the breach is not\ncured within a specified period of time\nfollowing notice, which can generally be given\nby the securitization trustee or a specified\npercentage of security holders, causing the\nCompany to lose servicing income. In addition,\nthe Company may be required to indemnify the\nsecuritization trustee against losses from any\nfailure by the Company, as a servicer or\nmaster servicer, to perform the Company\u2019s\nservicing obligations or any act or omission\non the Company\u2019s part that involves willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence.\nFor certain investors and certain\ntransactions, Truist may be contractually\nobligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or\nreimburse the investor for credit losses\nincurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing\nerrors with respect to the loan. The Company\nmay be subject to increased repurchase\nobligations as a result of claims made that\nthe Company did not satisfy its obligations as\na servicer or master servicer. The Company may\nalso experience increased loss severity on\nrepurchases, which may require a material\nincrease to the Company\u2019s repurchase reserve.\n\nThe Company has and may continue to receive\nindemnification requests related to the\nCompany\u2019s servicing of loans owned or insured\nby other parties, primarily GSEs. Typically,\nsuch a claim seeks to impose a compensatory\nfee on the Company for departures from GSE\nservice levels. In most cases, this is related\nto delays in the foreclosure process.\nAdditionally, the Company has received\nindemnification requests where an investor or\ninsurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of\nthe servicing agreement. While the number of\nsuch claims has been small, these could\nincrease in the future.\n\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Strategic Risks                             \n                                              \nTruist may face the risk of financial loss or\nnegative impact resulting from ineffective\nstrategy setting and execution, adverse\nbusiness decisions, or lack of responsiveness\nto changes in the external environment.\n\nEmbedded within strategic risks are risks\nassociated with:\n\n\u2022 maintaining a level of earnings appropriate\nto support growth objectives and the ability\nto maintain dividends in various economic\ncycles,\n\n\u2022 successful delivery of innovation and\ntechnology strategies that transform the\nclient experience as well as the way Truist\nconducts business,\n\n\u2022 changes and events within the external\nenvironment, including geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive,\nand regulatory factors, and\n\n\u2022 implementation and execution of climate risk\nmanagement related programs.\n\nAny of the foregoing may impact the successful\nexecution of Truist\u2019s strategy.\n\nCompetition may reduce Truist\u2019s client base or\ncause Truist to modify pricing for products\nand services.\n\nTruist operates in a highly competitive\nindustry that could become even more\ncompetitive with growth in areas such as neo-\nbanks, fintechs, and other non-bank platforms.\nIncreased competition could arise from\ntechnological advancements, legislative and\nregulatory changes, as well as competition\nfrom other financial services companies, some\nof which may be subject to less extensive\nregulation than Truist. The Company\u2019s success\ndepends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to\nadapt its offering of products and services to\nevolving industry standards and client\nexpectations. The widespread adoption of new\ntechnologies has required and will continue to\nrequire substantial investments to modify\nexisting products and services or to develop\nnew products and services. In addition, there\nis increasing pressure to provide products and\nservices at lower prices further reducing\ncontribution margins. The Company may not be\nsuccessful in introducing new products and\nservices in response to industry trends or\ndevelopments in technology or those new\nproducts may not achieve market acceptance.\n\nTruist also competes with nonbank companies\ninside and outside of the Company\u2019s market\narea and, in some cases, with companies other\nthan those traditionally considered financial\nsector participants. In particular, technology\ncompanies are increasingly focusing on the\nfinancial sector, either in partnership with\ncompetitor banking organizations or on their\nown. These companies generally are not subject\nto the same regulatory oversight as main\nstreet financial institutions and may\naccordingly realize certain cost strategies\nand offer products and services at more\nfavorable rates and with greater convenience\nto the client. This competition could result\nin the loss of clients and revenue in areas\nwhere fintechs are operating. As the pace of\ntechnology and change advance, continuous\ninnovation is expected to exert long-term\npressure on the financial services industry.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies by\ncompetitors, including internet banking\nservices, mobile applications, advanced ATM\nfunctionality and cryptocurrencies could\nrequire the Company to make substantial\ninvestments to modify or adapt the Company\u2019s\nexisting products and services or even\nradically alter the way Truist conducts\nbusiness. These and other capital investments\nin the Company\u2019s business may not produce\nexpected growth in earnings anticipated at the\ntime of the expenditure.\n\nTruist may not be able to complete future\nmergers or acquisitions.\n\nThe Company must generally satisfy a number of\nmeaningful conditions before completing an\nacquisition of another bank or BHC, including\nfederal and state regulatory approvals. In\ndetermining whether to approve a proposed bank\nor BHC acquisition, bank regulators will\nconsider, among other factors, the effect of\nthe acquisition on competition; financial\ncondition and future prospects, including\ncurrent and projected capital ratios and\nlevels; the competence, experience and\nintegrity of management; record of compliance\nwith laws and regulations; the convenience and\nneeds of the communities to be served,\nincluding the acquiring institution's record\nof compliance under the CRA; the effectiveness\nof the acquiring institution in combating\nmoney laundering activities; and protests from\nvarious stakeholders. In addition, U.S.\nregulators must take systemic risk to the U.S.\nfinancial system into account when evaluating\nwhether to approve a potential acquisition\ntransaction involving a large financial\ninstitution like Truist. There is no certainty\nas to when or if or on what terms and\nconditions, any required regulatory approvals\nwill be granted for any potential acquisition.\nIn specific cases, Truist may be required to\nsell banks or branches or take other actions\nas a condition to receiving regulatory\napproval. An inability to satisfy other\nconditions necessary to consummate an\nacquisition transaction, such as third party\nlitigation, a judicial order blocking the\ntransaction or lack of shareholder approval,\ncould also prevent the Company from completing\nan announced acquisition. There has been\nincreased scrutiny of bank and financial\ninstitution acquisitions from regulators and\ngovernment entities in recent years. Refer to\nthe \u201cAcquisitions\u201d section within Item 1\n\u201cBusiness\u201d for additional discussion.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 29\nTruist has businesses other than banking that\nare subject to a variety of risks.\n\nTruist is a diversified financial services\ncompany and this diversity subjects the\nCompany\u2019s earnings to a broader variety of\nrisks and uncertainties. Other businesses in\naddition to banking that the Company operates\ninclude insurance, investment banking,\nsecurities underwriting and market making,\nloan syndications, investment management and\nadvice and retail and wholesale brokerage\nservices offered through the Company\u2019s\nsubsidiaries. These businesses entail\nsignificant market, operational, credit,\ncompliance, technology, legal and other risks\nthat could materially adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations.\n                                              \n  Reputational Risks                          \n                                              \nNegative public opinion could damage the\nCompany\u2019s reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues.\n\nTruist\u2019s earnings and capital are subject to\nrisks associated with negative public opinion.\nNegative public opinion could result from the\nCompany\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any\nnumber of activities, including lending, sales\nand other operating practices, corporate\ngovernance, acquisitions, a breach of client\nor teammate information, the failure of any\nproduct or service sold to meet clients'\nexpectations or applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Negative public opinion could\nalso result from an increase in the level of\nsocial and environmental activism surrounding\nTruist or other financial services companies.\nNegative public opinion could adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nclients and teammates and can result in\nlitigation and regulatory actions. Actual or\nalleged conduct by one of the Company\u2019s\nbusinesses can result in negative public\nopinion about the Company\u2019s other businesses.\nActual or alleged conduct by another financial\nservices company can result in negative public\nopinion about the financial services industry\nin general and, as a result, adversely affect\nTruist.\n\nScrutiny of the Company\u2019s sales, training, and\nincentive compensation practices could damage\nthe Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact\nbusiness and revenues.\n\nThe Company may face increased scrutiny of the\nCompany\u2019s sales and other business practices,\ntraining practices, incentive compensation\ndesign and governance, and quality assurance\nand client complaint resolution practices.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s\nprocesses and actions will meet regulatory\nstandards or expectations. Findings from self-\nidentified or regulatory reviews may require\nresponsive actions, including increased\ninvestments in compliance systems and\nteammates or the payment of fines, penalties,\nincreased regulatory assessments or client\nredress and may increase legal or reputational\nrisk exposures.\n                                              \n  Operational Risks                           \n                                              \nLitigation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults.\n\nThe Company is subject to litigation in the\nordinary course of business. Claims and legal\nactions, including class action lawsuits and\nenforcement actions by the Company\u2019s\nregulators, which are becoming more common in\nthe current regulatory environment, could\ninvolve large monetary amounts, significant\ndefense costs, and result in settlements,\njudgments, penalties, fines, injunctions, or\nother forms of relief that are adverse to the\nCompany. The outcome of litigation and\nregulatory matters as well as the timing of\nultimate resolution are inherently difficult\nto predict.\n\nActual legal and other costs arising from\nclaims and legal actions may be greater than\nthe Company\u2019s legal reserves. The ultimate\nresolution of a pending legal proceeding could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, governmental authorities have, at\ntimes, sought criminal penalties against\ncompanies in the financial services sector for\nviolations, and, at times, have required an\nadmission of wrongdoing from financial\ninstitutions in connection with resolving such\nmatters. Criminal convictions or admissions of\nwrongdoing in a settlement with the government\ncan lead to greater exposure in civil\nlitigation and reputational harm.\n\nSubstantial legal liability or significant\nregulatory or government action against the\nCompany could have material adverse financial\neffects or cause significant reputational\nharm, which adversely impact the Company\u2019s\nbusiness prospects. Further, the Company may\nbe exposed to substantial uninsured\nliabilities, which could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company may incur fines, penalties and\nother negative consequences from regulatory\nviolations, including inadvertent or\nunintentional violations.\n\nTruist maintains systems and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that it complies with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can\nbe no assurance that these will be effective.\nIn addition to fines and penalties, the\nCompany may suffer other negative consequences\nfrom regulatory violations including\nrestrictions on certain activities, such as\nthe Company\u2019s mortgage business, which may\naffect the Company\u2019s relationship with the\nGSEs and may also damage the Company\u2019s\nreputation and this in turn might materially\naffect the Company\u2019s business and results of\noperations.\n\nFurther, some legal frameworks provide for the\nimposition of fines or penalties for\nnoncompliance even when the noncompliance was\ninadvertent or unintentional and even when\nthere were systems and procedures in place\ndesigned to ensure compliance. For example,\nTruist is subject to regulations issued by\nOFAC that prohibit financial institutions from\nparticipating in the transfer of property\nbelonging to the governments of certain\nforeign countries and designated nationals of\nthose countries. OFAC may impose penalties for\ninadvertent or unintentional violations even\nif reasonable processes are in place to\nprevent the violations. Courts may uphold\nsignificant additional penalties on financial\ninstitutions, even where the financial\ninstitution had already reimbursed the\ngovernment or other counterparties for actual\nlosses.\n\nTruist relies on other companies to provide\nkey components of the Company\u2019s business\ninfrastructure.\n\nThird parties provide key components of the\nCompany\u2019s business infrastructure, such as\nbanking services, data processing, business\nprocesses, internet connections, and network\naccess. Any disruption in such services\nprovided by these third parties or any failure\nof these third parties to handle current or\nhigher volumes of use could adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and\nservices to clients, to support teammates and\notherwise to conduct business. Technological\nor financial difficulties of a third party\nservice provider could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business to the extent those\ndifficulties result in the interruption or\ndiscontinuation of services provided by that\nparty. Further, in some instances, the Company\nmay be responsible for failures of such third\nparties to comply with government regulations.\nThe Company is not insured against all types\nof losses as a result of third party failures,\nand the insurance coverage that does exist may\nbe inadequate to protect the Company from all\nlosses resulting from system failures or other\ndisruptions. Failures in the Company\u2019s\nbusiness infrastructure could interrupt the\noperations or increase the costs of doing\nbusiness.\n\nTruist depends on the expertise of key\nteammates . If these individuals leave or\nchange their roles without effective\nreplacements, operations may suffer.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, to a large\ndegree, on the continued services of executive\nofficers and other key teammates who have\nextensive experience in the industry. The\nCompany\u2019s business could be adversely impacted\nfrom the loss of key persons or failure to\nmanage a smooth transition to new teammates.\nThese risks may be exacerbated as the Company\ncontinues to integrate processes and systems\nsubsequent to the Merger.\n\nThe Company may not be able to hire or retain\nadditional qualified teammates and recruiting\nand compensation costs may increase as a\nresult of changes in the marketplace, which\nmay increase costs and adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s ability to implement business\nstrategies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the ability\nto attract and retain high performing, diverse\nand well-qualified teammates. The Company\nfaces significant competition in the\nrecruitment of highly motivated teammates who\ncan deliver Truist\u2019s purpose, mission, and\nvalues, which has recently intensified as a\nresult of changes in the labor market caused\nby COVID-19. The Company\u2019s ability to execute\nits business strategy and provide high quality\nservice may suffer if the Company is unable to\nrecruit or retain a sufficient number of\nqualified teammates or if the costs of\nemployee compensation or benefits increase\nsubstantially. The U.S. banking agencies have\njointly issued comprehensive guidance designed\nto ensure that incentive compensation policies\ndo not undermine the safety and soundness of\nbanking organizations by encouraging teammates\nto take imprudent risks. This guidance\nsignificantly affects the amount, form, and\ncontext of incentive compensation to\nteammates. The FRB, FDIC, SEC, and other\nfederal regulatory agencies have jointly\nproposed rules, which would affect incentive\ncompensation. These rules were included on the\nSEC's regulatory agenda in 2021 for proposed\nrulemaking. If finalized, these rules may\nresult in additional costs and restrictions on\nthe form of the Company\u2019s incentive\ncompensation. These risks may be intensified\nin the increased work-from-home environment\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic as job\nopportunities may be less constrained by\nphysical geography.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 31\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may\nnot be effective.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks\nto mitigate risk and loss. Truist has\nestablished policies, processes, and\nprocedures intended to identify, measure,\nmonitor, report, and analyze the types of risk\nto which the Company is subject, including\nliquidity, credit, market, operational,\ntechnology, reputational, legal, model, and\ncompliance risk, among others. However, the\nCompany\u2019s risk management measures may not be\nfully effective in identifying and mitigating\nthe Company\u2019s risk exposure in all market\nenvironments or against all types of risk,\nincluding risks that are unidentified or\nunanticipated, even if the models for\nassessing risk are properly designed and\nimplemented. Some of the Company\u2019s methods of\nmanaging risk are based upon the Company\u2019s use\nof observed historical market behavior and\nmanagement's judgment. These methods may not\naccurately predict future exposures, which\ncould be significantly greater than historical\nmeasures indicate. If the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework proves ineffective, it\ncould suffer unexpected losses and could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models in Truist\u2019s business, which may\nimpact decisions made by Management and\nregulators.\n\nTruist relies on quantitative models to\nmeasure risks and to estimate certain\nfinancial values. Models may be used in such\nprocesses as determining the pricing of\nvarious products, grading loans and extending\ncredit, measuring interest rate and other\nmarket risks, predicting or estimating losses,\nassessing capital adequacy and calculating\neconomic and regulatory capital levels, as\nwell as estimating the value of financial\ninstruments and balance sheet items.\n\nPoorly designed or implemented models present\nthe risk that Truist\u2019s business decisions\nbased on information incorporating model\noutput would be adversely affected due to the\ninadequacy of that information. Also,\ninformation Truist provides to the public or\nto its regulators based on poorly designed or\nimplemented models could be inaccurate or\nmisleading. Some of the decisions that the\nregulators make, including those related to\ncapital distributions to Truist\u2019s\nshareholders, could be adversely affected due\nto the perception that the quality of the\nmodels used to generate the relevant\ninformation is insufficient.\n\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses\nfrom fraud.\n\nCriminals committing fraud increasingly are\nusing more sophisticated techniques and in\nsome cases, are a part of larger criminal\norganizations, which allow them to be more\neffective. Fraudulent activity has taken many\nforms and escalates as more tools for\naccessing financial services emerge, such as\nreal-time payments. Fraud schemes are broad\nand continuously evolving and include such\nthings as debit card/credit card fraud, check\nfraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM\nmachines, social engineering, and phishing\nattacks to obtain personal information or\nimpersonation of the Company\u2019s clients through\nthe use of falsified or stolen credentials.\n\nIn addition, individuals or business entities\nmay properly identify themselves, yet seek to\nestablish a business relationship for the\npurpose of perpetrating fraud. Increased\ndeployment of technologies, such as chip card\ntechnology, defray and reduce aspects of\nfraud; however, criminals are turning to other\nsources to steal personally identifiable\ninformation, such as unaffiliated healthcare\nproviders and government entities, in order to\nimpersonate the consumer to commit fraud.\nFurther, as a result of the increased\nsophistication of fraud activity, the Company\nhas increased spending on systems, resources\nand controls to detect and prevent fraud, as\nwell as increased spending to provide certain\ncredit monitoring and identity theft\nprotection services to the Company\u2019s consumer\nclients. This will result in continued ongoing\ninvestments in the future.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operational or security systems\nor infrastructure or those of third parties,\ncould fail or be breached, which could disrupt\nthe Company\u2019s business and adversely impact\nthe Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity\nand financial condition, as well as cause\nlegal or reputational harm.\n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure\nexists throughout the Company\u2019s business and,\nas a result of the Company\u2019s interactions with\nand reliance on third parties, is not limited\nto the Company\u2019s own internal operational\nfunctions. The Company\u2019s operational and\nsecurity systems and infrastructure, including\ncomputer systems, data management and internal\nprocesses, as well as those of third parties,\nare integral to the Company\u2019s performance.\nTruist teammates and third parties may expose\nthe Company to risk as a result of human\nerror, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure\nor breach of systems and infrastructure. For\nexample, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct\nbusiness may be adversely affected by any\nsignificant disruptions, including to third\nparties with whom the Company interacts or\nrelies upon.\n\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents, which may increase in frequency and\nintensity due to climate change, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\noperations or the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition and results.\n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic weather events\nor pandemics could adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s financial condition or results of\noperations. Truist has significant operations\nand clients along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts\nas well as other regions of the U.S., which\ncould be adversely impacted by hurricanes,\ntornadoes and other severe weather in those\nareas. Truist and its clients could also be\ndisrupted by the physical effects of climate\nchange, which may become more frequent and\nsevere. Natural and other types of disasters,\nincluding as a result of climate change, could\nhave an adverse impact on Truist\u2019s businesses\nin that such events could materially disrupt\nthe Company\u2019s operations or the ability or\nwillingness of the Company\u2019s clients to access\nthe financial services offered by Truist,\nincluding adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s\nborrowers to timely repay their loans and the\nvalue of any collateral held. These events\ncould reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and cause\nvolatility in the Company\u2019s financial results\nfor any fiscal quarter or year and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough Truist has business continuity plans\nand other safeguards in place, the Company\u2019s\noperations and communications may be adversely\naffected by natural disasters or other\ncatastrophic events, and there can be no\nassurance that such business continuity plans\nwill be effective.\n\nTruist may be impacted by the soundness of\nother financial institutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine\nfunding transactions could be adversely\naffected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are\ninterrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. Truist\nhas exposure to many different industries and\ncounterparties and routinely executes\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial industry, including brokers and\ndealers, central counterparties, commercial\nbanks, investment banks, mutual and hedge\nfunds and other institutional investors and\nclients. As a result, defaults by, or even\nrumors or questions about, one or more\nfinancial services institutions or the\nfinancial services industry generally, in the\npast have led to market-wide liquidity\nproblems and could lead to losses or defaults\nby Truist or by other institutions. Many of\nthese transactions expose the Company to\ncredit risk in the event of default of the\nCompany\u2019s counterparty or client. In addition,\nthe Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated\nwhen the collateral held by Truist cannot be\nliquidated or is liquidated at prices not\nsufficient to recover the full amount of the\nCompany\u2019s exposure. Any such losses could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n\nTruist depends on the accuracy and\ncompleteness of information about clients and\ncounterparties.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter\ninto other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, Truist relies on the\ncompleteness and accuracy of representations\nmade by and information furnished by or on\nbehalf of clients and counterparties,\nincluding financial statements and other\nfinancial information. If the information\nprovided is not accurate or complete, the\nCompany\u2019s decisions about extending credit or\nentering into other transactions with clients\nor counterparties could be adversely affected\nand the Company could suffer defaults, credit\nlosses or other negative consequences as a\nresult.\n\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and\nprocesses are critical to how the Company\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations and require management to make\nestimates about matters that are uncertain.\n\nAccounting policies and processes are\nfundamental to how the Company records and\nreports its financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require the\nuse of estimates and assumptions that may\naffect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or\nliabilities and financial results. Several of\nthe Company\u2019s accounting policies are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective, and complex judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain\nand because it is likely that materially\ndifferent amounts would be reported under\ndifferent conditions or using different\nassumptions. If assumptions or estimates\nunderlying the Company\u2019s financial statements\nare incorrect or are adjusted periodically,\nthe Company may experience material losses.\n\nManagement has identified certain accounting\npolicies as being critical because they\nrequire management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the\nvaluations of assets, liabilities,\ncommitments, and contingencies. A variety of\nfactors could affect the realization of income\nand expense or the recognition of assets and\nliabilities in the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements. Truist has established detailed\npolicies and control procedures that are\nintended to ensure these critical accounting\nestimates and judgments are well controlled\nand applied consistently. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to ensure\nthat the process for changing methodologies\noccurs in an appropriate manner. Due to the\nuncertainty surrounding the Company\u2019s\njudgments and the estimates pertaining to\nthese matters, the Company cannot guarantee\nthat adjustments to accounting policies or\nrestatement of prior period financial\nstatements will not be required.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 33\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC\nchange the financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that govern the preparation of the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements. In addition,\naccounting standard setters and those who\ninterpret the accounting standards may change\nor even reverse their previous interpretations\nor positions on how these standards should be\napplied. Changes in financial accounting and\nreporting standards and changes in current\ninterpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol, can be hard to predict and could\nmaterially affect how the Company reports its\nfinancial results and condition. In some\ncases, the Company could be required to apply\na new or revised standard retroactively,\nresulting in the restatement of prior period\nfinancial statements.\n\nDepressed market values for the Company\u2019s\nstock and adverse economic conditions\nsustained over a period of time may require\nthe Company to write down all or some portion\nof the Company\u2019s goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is periodically tested for impairment\nby comparing the fair value of each reporting\nunit to its carrying amount. If the fair value\nis greater than the carrying amount, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be\nimpaired. The fair value of a reporting unit\nis impacted by the reporting unit\u2019s expected\nfinancial performance and susceptibility to\nadverse economic, regulatory, and legislative\nchanges. Future adverse changes in economic\nconditions or expected financial performance\nmay cause the fair value of a reporting unit\nto be below its carrying amount, resulting in\ngoodwill impairment. The estimated fair values\nof the individual reporting units are assessed\nfor reasonableness by reviewing a variety of\nindicators, including comparing these\nestimated fair values to the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime. While this comparison provides some\nrelative market information about the\nestimated fair value of the reporting units,\nit is not determinative and needs to be\nevaluated in the context of the current\neconomic environment. However, significant and\nsustained declines in the Company\u2019s market\ncapitalization could be an indication of\npotential goodwill impairment. Refer to the\n\"Critical Accounting Policies\" section for\nadditional details related to the Company\u2019s\nintangible assets policy.\n\nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of\nthe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation may\nhave an anti-takeover effect.\n\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including\nregulatory approval requirements, could make\nit difficult for a third party to acquire the\nCompany, even if doing so would be perceived\nto be beneficial to the Company\u2019s owners.\nAcquisition of certain amounts of any class of\nvoting stock of a BHC or depository\ninstitution, including shares of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock, may create a rebuttable\npresumption that the acquirer \"controls\" the\nBHC or depository institution and thus, unless\nthe acquirer is able to rebut this\npresumption, it would be subject to various\nlaws and regulations applicable to a BHC.\nAlso, a BHC must obtain the prior approval of\nthe FRB before, among other things, acquiring\ndirect or indirect ownership or control of\nmore than 5% of the voting shares of any bank,\nincluding Truist Bank.\n\nThere also are provisions in the Company\u2019s\namended and restated articles of incorporation\nand amended and restated bylaws, such as\nlimitations on the ability to call a special\nmeeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders, that\nmay be used to delay or block a takeover\nattempt. In addition, the Company\u2019s Board will\nbe authorized under the Company\u2019s amended and\nrestated articles of incorporation to issue\nshares of the Company\u2019s preferred stock and to\ndetermine the rights, terms, conditions and\nprivileges of such preferred stock, without\nshareholder approval. These provisions may\neffectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or\nother business combination.\n                                              \n  Technology Risks                            \n                                              \nThe Company faces cybersecurity risks,\nincluding denial of service, hacking, and\nmalware or ransomware attacks, which could\nresult in the disclosure of confidential\ninformation, adversely affect the Company\u2019s\noperations or reputation, and create\nsignificant legal and financial exposure.\n\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network\ninfrastructure and those of third parties are\nfrequently targeted in cyber-attacks, such as\ndenial of service attacks, hacking, malware or\nransomware intrusion, data corruption\nattempts, terrorist activities, or identity\ntheft. The Company\u2019s business relies on the\nsecure processing, transmission, storage, and\nretrieval of confidential, proprietary, and\nother information in the Company\u2019s information\nsystems and that of third parties. In\naddition, to access the Company\u2019s network,\nproducts, and services, the Company\u2019s clients\nand other third parties may use personal\nmobile devices or computing devices that are\noutside of the Company\u2019s network environment\nand can introduce added cybersecurity risks.\n\nTruist and Truist\u2019s clients, regulators and\nother third parties, including other financial\nservices institutions and companies engaged in\ndata processing, have been subject to and are\nlikely to continue to be the target of, cyber-\nattacks and similar incidents. Cyber-attacks\nmay expose security vulnerabilities in the\nCompany\u2019s systems or the systems of third\nparties or other security measures that could\nresult in the unauthorized gathering,\nmonitoring, misuse, release, loss, or\ndestruction of confidential, proprietary, or\nsensitive information. A cyber-attack could\nalso damage the Company\u2019s systems by\nintroducing material disruptions to the\nCompany\u2019s or the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 or other\nthird parties\u2019 network access or business\noperations. As cyber threats continue to\nevolve, the Company may be required to expend\nsignificant additional resources to continue\nto modify or enhance the Company\u2019s protective\nmeasures or to investigate and remediate any\ninformation security vulnerabilities or\nincidents. Despite efforts to ensure the\nintegrity of the Company\u2019s systems and\nimplement controls, processes, policies and\nother protective measures, the Company may not\nbe able to anticipate all security breaches,\nnor may the Company be able to implement\nsufficient preventive measures against such\nsecurity breaches, which may result in\nmaterial losses or consequences to Truist.\n\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions\nhave significantly increased in recent years\nin part because of the proliferation of new\ntechnologies to facilitate and conduct\nfinancial transactions. For example,\ncybersecurity risks may increase in the future\nas Truist continues to evolve its internal and\nexternal digital offerings and capabilities.\nIn addition, cybersecurity risks have\nsignificantly increased in recent years in\npart due to the increased sophistication and\nactivities of organized crime affiliates,\nterrorist organizations, hostile foreign\ngovernments, disgruntled teammates or vendors,\nactivists and other external parties,\nincluding those involved in corporate\nespionage. Even the most advanced internal\ncontrol environment may be vulnerable to\ncompromise. Persistent attackers may succeed\nin penetrating defenses given enough\nresources, time, and motive. The techniques\nused by cyber criminals change frequently, and\nmay not be recognized until launched or well\nafter a breach has occurred. In addition, the\nexistence of cyber-attacks or security\nbreaches at third party vendors with access to\nthe Company\u2019s data may not be disclosed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nThe Company also faces indirect technology,\ncybersecurity and other operational risks\nrelating to clients and other third parties\nthat the Company relies upon to facilitate or\nenable business activities, including,\nfinancial counterparties, regulators, and\nproviders of critical infrastructure such as\ninternet access and electrical power. In\naddition, Truist faces cybersecurity and other\noperational risks relating to the Merger,\nincluding increased phishing attacks on\nteammates, increased network perimeter\nscanning by attackers searching for\nvulnerabilities and domain name squatting.\nFurther, as a result of increasing\nconsolidation, interdependence, and complexity\nof financial entities and technology systems,\na technology failure, cyber-attack or other\ninformation or security breach that\nsignificantly degrades, deletes, or\ncompromises the systems or data of one or more\nfinancial entities could have a material\nimpact on counterparties or other market\nparticipants. This consolidation,\ninterconnectivity, and complexity increases\nthe risk of operational failure, on both\nindividual and industry-wide bases, as\ndisparate systems need to be integrated, often\non an accelerated basis. Any third party\ntechnology failure, cyber-attack, other\ninformation or security breach, termination,\nor constraint could, among other things,\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to\nconduct transactions, service the Company\u2019s\nclients, manage the Company\u2019s exposure to risk\nor expand the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe public perception that a cyber-attack on\nthe Company\u2019s systems has been successful,\nwhether or not this perception is correct, may\ndamage the Company\u2019s reputation with clients\nand third parties with whom the Company does\nbusiness. The compromise of personal\ninformation, in particular, could result in\nidentify theft and cause serious reputational\nharm. A successful penetration or\ncircumvention of system security could cause\nserious negative consequences, including loss\nof clients and business opportunities; costs\nassociated with maintaining business\nrelationships after an attack or breach;\nsignificant disruption to the Company\u2019s\noperations and business; misappropriation,\nexposure or destruction of the Company\u2019s\nconfidential information, intellectual\nproperty, funds and those of the Company\u2019s\nclients; damage to the Company\u2019s or the\nCompany\u2019s clients\u2019 or third parties\u2019 computers\nor systems; or a violation of applicable\nprivacy laws and other laws. This could result\nin litigation exposure, regulatory fines,\npenalties, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s\nsecurity measures, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other compensatory costs, and\nadditional compliance costs, which could\nadversely impact the Company\u2019s results of\noperations, liquidity, and financial\ncondition. In addition, the Company may not\nhave adequate insurance coverage to compensate\nfor losses from a cybersecurity event.\n\nTruist will continually encounter\ntechnological change and must effectively\nanticipate, develop, and implement new\ntechnology.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing\nrapid technological change with frequent\nintroductions of new technology-driven\nproducts and services. Truist has invested in\ntechnology to automate functions previously\nperformed manually, to facilitate the ability\nof clients to engage in financial transactions\nand otherwise to enhance the client experience\nwith respect to the Company\u2019s products and\nservices. Truist expects to make additional\ninvestments in innovation and technology to\naddress technological disruption in the\nindustry and improve client offerings and\nservice. These changes allow the Company to\nbetter serve the Company\u2019s clients and to\nreduce costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in\npart, upon the Company\u2019s ability to address\nclients\u2019 needs by using technology to provide\nproducts and services that satisfy client\ndemands, including demands for faster and more\nsecure payment services, to create\nefficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations and\nto integrate those offerings with legacy\nplatforms or to update those legacy platforms.\nA failure to maintain or enhance the Company\u2019s\ncompetitive position with respect to\ntechnology, whether because of a failure to\nanticipate client expectations, a failure in\nthe performance of technological developments\nor an untimely roll out of developments, may\ncause the Company to lose market share or\nincur additional expense.\n\nThe Company faces risks associated with\nquality, availability and retention of key\ndata for operational, strategic, and\ncompliance purposes.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial and regulatory\nreporting and key business decisions are\nreliant on the quality, availability and\nretention of data. While Truist has\nimplemented a robust data management control\nframework to mitigate the risks associated\nwith data while at rest, in motion, and in\nuse, a control failure may lead to data loss,\ndata misuse, and data quality risks. These\nfailures may ultimately result in inaccuracies\nin financial and regulatory reports, inhibited\nmanagement decision-making, financial loss,\nreputational risk, and regulatory compliance\nrisk, including privacy compliance risks to\nthe extent that the Company has ineffective or\nflawed consumer data management processes and\nmonitoring.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

Truist would expect to\nperiodically repurchase shares in the future,\nto the extent the Company has excess capital\nand does not have sufficient investment\nopportunities in the form of organic growth\nand / or acquisitions. In accordance with\nNorth Carolina law, repurchased shares cannot\nbe held as treasury stock, but revert to the\nstatus of authorized and unissued shares upon\nrepurchase. Repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases, privately\nnegotiated transactions, trading plans\nestablished in accordance with SEC rules or\nother means. The timing and exact amount of\nrepurchases are subject to various factors,\nincluding the Company\u2019s capital position,\nliquidity, financial performance, alternative\nuses of capital, stock trading price and\ngeneral market conditions, and may be\nsuspended at any time. Shares repurchased\nconstitute authorized but unissued shares of\nthe Company and are therefore available for\nfuture issuances.

Net interest income on a TE\nbasis was $13.1 billion, a decrease of $837\nmillion. The decrease in net interest income\nwas due primarily to lower purchase accounting\naccretion and a $21.1 billion decrease in\naverage outstanding loans, partially offset by\na $56.3 billion increase in average securities\nas a result of strong deposit growth.\nNoninterest income for 2021 increased $411\nmillion compared to 2020 due to strong\nperformance from investment banking,\ninsurance, wealth, and card and payment\nrelated fees. Excluding gains of $37 million\nfrom the divestiture of certain businesses in\n2021 and securities gains of $402 million from\n2020, adjusted taxable equivalent revenues\ndecreased $61 million, or 0.3%, compared to\nthe earlier year.\n\nNIM was 2.86% for 2021, down 36 basis points\ncompared to the prior year.

The average cost of\ninterest-bearing deposits was 0.06%, down 26\nbasis points. The average cost of long-term\ndebt was 1.53%, down 22 basis points. The\naverage cost of total deposits was 0.04%, down\n18 basis points.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was a benefit\nof $813 million, compared to a cost of $2.3\nbillion for the prior year. Net charge-offs\nwere $697 million, compared to $1.1 billion\nfor the prior year. Asset quality ratios were\nrelatively stable at December 31, 2021\ncompared to the prior year, reflecting\nTruist\u2019s prudent risk culture, portfolio\ndiversification, improving economic\nconditions, and the ongoing effects of\ngovernment stimulus. The ratio of the ALLL to\nnet charge-offs was 6.36X for 2021, compared\nto 5.21X in 2020, reflecting lower net charge-\noffs. NPAs decreased $224 million year over\nyear due to declines across almost all\nportfolios, partially offset by an increase in\nthe indirect auto portfolio.\n\nNoninterest income increased $411 million, or\n4.6%, compared to the prior year. Excluding\nsecurities gains and a gain on the divestiture\nof certain businesses, noninterest income was\nup $776 million, or 9.2%, highlighted by\nstrong performance from investment banking,\ninsurance, wealth, and card and payment\nrelated fees.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $219 million, or\n1.5%, compared to the prior year. Excluding\nmerger-related and restructuring charges,\nincremental operating expenses related to the\nMerger, the impact of the extinguishment of\ndebt, charitable contributions, an\nacceleration of loss recognition related to\ncertain terminated cash flow hedges, a one-\ntime professional fee expense, and the impact\nof amortization expense for intangibles,\nnoninterest expense increased $154 million, or\n1.2%. This increase in noninterest expense was\ndriven by incentives expense due to stronger\nperformance and insurance acquisitions,\npartially offset by the ongoing impact of cost\nsaving efforts from the Merger.\n\nTruist's total assets at December 31, 2021\nwere $541.2 billion, an increase of $32.0\nbillion compared to December 31, 2020,\nreflecting a $33.8 billion increase in\nsecurities, a $2.3 billion increase in\nsecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell, a $2.1 billion increase\nin goodwill and intangible assets, partially\noffset by a decrease of loans and leases HFI,\nnet of ALLL, of $8.8 billion.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 41\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2021 were\n$472.0 billion, an increase of $33.7 billion\nfrom the prior year, reflecting an increase of\n$35.4 billion in deposits, partially offset by\na decrease of $3.7 billion in long-term debt.\n\nTotal shareholders' equity was $69.3 billion\nat December 31, 2021, down $1.6 billion\ncompared to the prior year, reflecting a\ndecrease in AOCI of $2.3 billion, primarily\ndue to unrealized losses on AFS debt\nsecurities, $1.6 billion common share\nrepurchases, and the redemption of $1.4\nbillion of preferred shares, partially offset\nby net income in excess of dividends paid of\n$3.6 billion.\n\nTruist maintained strong capital and liquidity\nin 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the CET1\nratio was 9.6% and the average LCR was 114%.\nTruist increased the quarterly common dividend\n7% during the year and declared total common\ndividends of $1.86 per share during 2021. The\ndividend payout ratio for 2021 was 41%\ncompared to 58% for the prior year. The total\npayout ratio for 2021 was 68% compared to 58%\nfor the prior year, reflecting the resumption\nof share repurchases. During 2021, Truist\ncompleted the acquisition of Service Finance\nto expand point-of-sale lending capabilities\nand Constellation Affiliated Partners to\nexpand IH\u2019s wholesale division. In early 2022,\nTruist declared common dividends of $0.48 per\nshare for the first quarter of 2022, and\nannounced the acquisition of Kensington\nVanguard National Land Services to expand IH\u2019s\ntitle insurance operation.\n                                              \n  Key Areas of Focus                          \n                                              \nTruist's business is dynamic and complex.\nConsequently, management annually evaluates\nand, as necessary, adjusts the Company\u2019s\nbusiness strategy in the context of the\ncurrent operating environment. During this\nprocess, management considers the current\nfinancial condition and performance of the\nCompany and its expectations for future\neconomic activity from both a national and\nlocal market perspective. Achieving key\nstrategic objectives and established long-term\nfinancial goals is subject to many\nuncertainties and challenges. In the opinion\nof management, the following are the key areas\nof focus most likely to impact Truist\u2019s near\nto medium term performance:\n\n\u2022 Championing the Company\u2019s purpose to inspire\nand build better lives and communities;\n\n\u2022 Leading with purpose to provide profitable\ngrowth and achieve positive operating\nleverage;\n\n\u2022 Shifting from an integration focus to an\noperating focus, with a particular emphasis on\nexecutional excellence and profitable growth,\n\n\u2022 Attracting and retaining key teammates and\nadvancing teammate and leadership development;\n\n\u2022 Driving innovation and remaining attuned to\nevolving client preferences to succeed in an\nintensely competitive environment;\n\n\u2022 Executing the Company\u2019s \"T3 strategy\" by\nfocusing on personal touch and technology to\nengender trust and provide distinctive, secure\nand successful client experiences;\n\n\u2022 Advancing DEI and ESG initiatives;\n\n\u2022 Achieving the benefits from the Merger,\nincluding anticipated synergies through cost\nsaving and Truist\u2019s Integrated Relationship\nManagement approach; and\n\n\u2022 Managing the integration of systems and\noperations, while safeguarding the Company\nagainst external threats.\n\nIn addition, certain other challenges and\nunforeseen events could have a near term\nimpact on Truist's financial condition and\nresults of operations.

These decreases were partially\noffset by growth in the securities portfolio,\nlower funding costs, higher fees on PPP loans,\nand releases of interest deferrals related to\nCOVID-19 loan accommodations established in\n2020. Average earning assets increased $24.4\nbillion, or 5.6%, compared to the prior\nperiod. The increase in average earning assets\nreflects a $56.3 billion, or 68%, increase in\naverage securities, while average total loans\nand leases decreased $21.1 billion, or 6.7%,\nand average other earning assets decreased\n$11.7 billion, or 38%. The growth in average\nearning assets is a result of an increase in\ninvestment securities driven by strong deposit\ngrowth resulting from fiscal and monetary\nstimulus. Average deposits increased $35.1\nbillion, or 9.7%, compared to the prior year,\nwhile average long-term debt and short-term\nborrowings decreased $8.4 billion, or 18%, and\n$4.0 billion, or 39%, respectively.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.86% for the year\nended December 31, 2021, down 36 basis points\ncompared to the prior year. The yield on the\ntotal loan portfolio for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 was 3.95%, down 38 basis\npoints compared to the prior year, reflecting\nthe impact of lower purchase accounting\naccretion and the ongoing impact of the low\nrate environment. The yield on the average\nsecurities portfolio was 1.50% for the year\nended December 31, 2021, down 59 basis points\ncompared to the prior year primarily due to\nlower yields on new purchases and higher\npremium amortization.\n\nThe average cost of total deposits was 0.04%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, down 18\nbasis points compared to the prior year. The\naverage cost on short-term borrowings was\n0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2021,\ndown 59 basis points compared to the prior\nyear. The average cost on long-term debt was\n1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2021,\ndown 22 basis points compared to the prior\nyear. The lower rates on interest-bearing\nliabilities reflect the lower rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the remaining\nunamortized fair value marks on the loan and\nlease portfolio, deposits, and long-term debt\nwere $1.3 billion, $7 million, and $139\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31,\n2020, the remaining unamortized fair value\nmarks on the loan and lease portfolio,\ndeposits and long-term debt were $2.4 billion,\n$19 million, and $216 million, respectively.\n\nThe remaining unamortized fair value mark on\nloans and leases consist of $700 million for\nconsumer loans and leases, and $623 million\nfor commercial loans and leases. These amounts\nwill be recognized over the remaining\ncontractual lives of the underlying\ninstruments or as paydowns occur.\n\nThe major components of net interest income\nand the related annualized yields as well as\nthe variances between the periods caused by\nchanges in interest rates versus changes in\nvolumes are summarized below.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 43\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Yields are stated on a TE basis utilizing\nfederal tax rate.

The\ncurrent year also includes $200 million for\ncharitable contributions to the Truist\nFoundation and the Truist Charitable Fund\n(other expense), $36 million of expense\nassociated with an acceleration of loss\nrecognition related to certain terminated cash\nflow hedges, a $30 million professional fee\nexpense, and a small gain on the early\nextinguishment of debt, whereas the earlier\nyear included a $235 million loss on the early\nextinguishment of debt and a $50 million\ncharitable contribution. Excluding the\naforementioned items and a decrease of $111\nmillion for amortization of intangibles,\nnoninterest expense increased $154 million, or\n1.2%, compared to the earlier year. Personnel\nexpense increased $486 million primarily\ndriven by higher incentive expenses due to\nvariable compensation from higher revenues and\nimproved overall performance relative to\ntargets, higher medical insurance claims,\nhigher other employee benefits due to the\npreviously mentioned increase in noninterest\nincome, and personnel cost related to acquired\ncompanies. These increases in personnel\nexpense were partially offset by lower\nsalaries due to fewer FTEs. Software expense\nincreased $83 million due to higher spending\non certain projects. Other expense includes a\ndecrease of $167 million for non-service-\nrelated pension cost components. There was\nalso a decrease of $140 million from net\noccupancy expense primarily due to branch and\nproperty consolidations and a decrease in\noperating lease depreciation of $68 million\ndue to valuation adjustments taken in the\nprior year.\n\nMerger-Related and Restructuring Charges\n\nTruist has incurred certain merger-related and\nrestructuring charges, which include:\n\n\u2022 severance and personnel-related costs or\ncredits;\n\n\u2022 occupancy and equipment charges or credits,\nwhich relate to costs or gains associated with\nlease terminations, obsolete equipment write-\noffs and the sale of duplicate facilities and\nequipment;\n\n\u2022 professional services, which relate to legal\nand investment banking advisory fees and other\nconsulting services pertaining to\nrestructuring initiatives or transactions;\n\n\u2022 systems conversion and related charges,\nwhich represent costs to integrate the\nentity's information technology systems;\n\n\u2022 other merger-related and restructuring\ncharges or credits, which include expenses\nnecessary to convert and combine the acquired\nbranches and operations of merged companies,\ndirect media advertising related to the\nmergers and acquisitions, asset and supply\ninventory write-offs, and other similar\ncharges; and\n\n\u2022 write-offs related to exiting certain\nbusinesses.\n\nMerger-related and restructuring accruals are\nestablished when the costs are incurred or\nonce all requirements for a plan to dispose of\nor outsource certain business functions have\nbeen approved by management.

Noninterest income\ndecreased $378 million primarily due to a gain\non the sale of non-agency MBS in the same\nperiod of the prior year, partially offset by\nincome from assets held for certain post-\nemployment benefits. Noninterest expense\nincreased $251 million primarily due to\ncharitable contributions to the Truist\nFoundation and the Truist Charitable Fund, as\nwell as higher incremental operating expenses\nrelated to the Merger and higher restructuring\ncharges in the current year, partially offset\nby the loss on early extinguishment of long-\nterm debt in the same period of the prior\nyear.\n\n48 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Analysis of Financial Condition             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Investment Activities                       \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s Board-approved investment policy is\ncarried out by the MRLCC, which meets\nregularly to review the economic environment\nand establish investment strategies.

Management believes that this purpose\ncan best be accomplished by building strong\nclient relationships over time and developing\nin-depth local market knowledge. The Company\nemploys strict underwriting criteria governing\nthe degree of risk assumed and the diversity\nof the loan portfolio in terms of type,\nindustry, and geographical concentration.\n\nTruist lends to a diverse client base that is\ngeographically dispersed to mitigate\nconcentration risk arising from local and\nregional economic downturns. International\nloans were immaterial as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020. The following discussion provides\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease portfolios. Refer to the \"Risk\nManagement\" section for a discussion of the\ncredit risk management policies used to manage\nthe portfolios.\n\n50 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCommercial Loan and Lease Portfolio\n\nCommercial loans and leases represent the\nlargest category of the Company\u2019s loan and\nlease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking\ngenerally targets small-to-middle market\nbusinesses with annual sales between $2\nmillion and $500 million, while CIB provides\nlending solutions to large corporate clients.\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio\nconsists of lending to public and private\nbusiness clients and is composed of commercial\nand industrial, owner occupied, equipment\nleasing and financing, commercial real estate,\nand government and institutional financing.\n\nIn accordance with the Company\u2019s lending\npolicy, each commercial loan undergoes a\ndetailed underwriting process. Commercial\nloans are typically priced with an interest\nrate tied to market indices, such as the prime\nrate, LIBOR, or SOFR and are individually\nmonitored and reviewed for deterioration in\nthe ability of the client to repay the loan.\nThe majority of Truist\u2019s commercial loans are\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories, and other types of collateral.\n\nResidential Mortgage Loan Portfolio\n\nTruist primarily originates conforming\nmortgage loans, loans under FHA, U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, or U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture programs, and higher\nquality jumbo and construction-to-permanent\nloans for 1-4 family residential properties.\nConforming loans are loans that are\nunderwritten in accordance with the\nunderwriting standards set forth by FNMA and\nFHLMC. They are generally collateralized by\none-to-four-family residential real estate,\ntypically have loan-to-collateral value ratios\nof 80% or less at origination, or have\nmortgage insurance as required by investors\nand are made to borrowers in good credit\nstanding.\n\nRisks associated with mortgage lending include\ninterest rate risk, which is mitigated through\nthe sale of a substantial portion of\nconforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary\nmortgage market and an effective MSR hedging\nprocess. Credit risk is managed through\nrigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage\ninsurance. The right to service the loans and\nreceive servicing income is generally retained\nwhen conforming loans are sold. Management\nbelieves that the retention of mortgage\nservicing diversifies income while enabling\nTruist to build long-term client relationships\nand offer high quality client service. Truist\nalso purchases residential mortgage loans from\ncorrespondent originators. The loans purchased\nfrom third party originators are subject to\nsubstantially the same underwriting and risk-\nmanagement criteria as loans originated\ninternally.\n\nResidential Home Equity and Direct Loan\nPortfolio\n\nThe residential home equity and direct loan\nportfolio is composed of a wide variety of\nsecured and unsecured loans offered through\nTruist\u2019s branch network, as well as loans\noriginated by LightStream, Truist\u2019s national\nonline consumer lending division. Loans\noriginated through the Truist branch network\ninclude revolving home equity lines of credit\nsecured by first or second liens on\nresidential real estate and certain other\nsecured and unsecured lending marketed to\nqualifying clients and other creditworthy\ncandidates in Truist\u2019s market areas.\nLightStream provides fixed-rate, unsecured\nlending to consumers with strong credit\nthrough its proprietary online loan\norigination system.\n\nIndirect Auto Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect auto portfolio primarily includes\nsecured indirect installment loans to\nconsumers for the purchase of new and used\nautomobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also\nincludes nonprime and near prime automobile\nfinance. Such loans are originated through\napproved franchised and independent dealers\nthroughout the Truist market area and\nnationally through Regional Acceptance\nCorporation. These loans are relatively\nhomogeneous and no single loan is individually\nsignificant in terms of its size and potential\nrisk of loss. Indirect auto loans are subject\nto rigorous lending policies and procedures\nand are underwritten with note amounts and\ncredit limits that are consistent with the\nCompany\u2019s risk philosophy. In addition to its\nnormal underwriting due diligence, Truist uses\napplication systems and scoring systems to\nhelp underwrite and manage the credit risk in\nits indirect auto portfolio.\n\nIndirect Other Loan Portfolio\n\nThe indirect other portfolio includes secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used boats and\nrecreational vehicles. The indirect other\nportfolio also includes small ticket consumer\nlending related to the purchase of power\nsports equipment. These loans are relatively\nhomogeneous and no single loan is individually\nsignificant in terms of its size and potential\nrisk of loss. These loans are subject to\nsimilar rigorous lending policies and\nprocedures as the indirect auto loan\nportfolio. The indirect other loan portfolio\nalso includes other indirect and point-of-sale\nlending to consumers to finance home\nimprovements, furniture purchases, certain\nelective health-care services, power sports,\ntrailer, and other consumer products segments.\nThese loans are originated in accordance with\nstrict underwriting criteria as determined by\nTruist.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\nStudent Loan Portfolio\n\nThe student loan portfolio is primarily\ncomposed of government guaranteed student\nloans and additionally includes certain\nprivate student loans originated by third\nparties. The government guarantee mitigates\nsubstantially all of the risk related to\nprincipal and interest repayment for this\ncomponent of the portfolio. Private student\nloans were purchased from third party\noriginators with credit enhancements that\npartially mitigate the Company\u2019s credit\nexposure.\n\nCredit Card Loan Portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio consists of the\noutstanding balances on credit cards.

The carrying value of PPP loans\nwas $2.1 billion and $10.8 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nExcluding PPP loans, commercial and industrial\nloans were up $3.8 billion, or 2.9%, while CRE\nand commercial construction declined $2.6\nbillion, or 10%, and $1.5 billion, or 23%,\nrespectively.\n\nConsumer loans decreased $1.2 billion during\n2021 primarily due to refinance activity\nresulting in a $998 million decline in\nresidential home equity and direct loans and a\n$772 million decline in student loans due to\npaydowns on government guaranteed loans. This\nwas partially offset by a $580 million\nincrease in residential mortgages due to the\nstrategy to put certain correspondent channel\nproduction onto the balance sheet and lower\nprepayments.\n\nLHFS decreased $1.2 billion during 2021\nprimarily due to the sale of $1.0 billion due\nto the divestiture of certain businesses.\n\n52 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the\nloans and leases, segregated by contractual\nmaturity of payments and interest rate terms.\nDeterminations of maturities are based on\ncontractual terms, except when rollovers or\nextensions are included for purposes of\nmeasuring the ACL.

the borrower. As a result,\nTruist works with borrowers to prevent further\ndifficulties and to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on a loan. To facilitate this\nprocess, a concessionary modification that\nwould not otherwise be considered may be\ngranted, resulting in classification of the\nloan as a TDR. For loan modification programs\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Truist\napplied the relief from TDR accounting\ndescribed in the CARES Act. Payment relief\nassistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-\naging programs, along with certain other\nmodification strategies.

At\nDecember 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and\nlease losses was 6.36 times annualized net\ncharge-offs, compared to 5.21 times at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nNet charge-offs during 2021 totaled $697\nmillion, down $422 million compared to the\nprior year, reflecting Truist\u2019s prudent risk\nculture, portfolio diversification, improving\neconomic conditions, and the ongoing effects\nof government stimulus. As a percentage of\naverage loans and leases, annualized net\ncharge-offs were 0.24%, down 12 basis points\ncompared to the prior year. Prior year net\ncharge-offs include $97 million of charge-offs\nrelated to the implementation of CECL, which\nrequired a gross-up of loan carrying values in\nconnection with the establishment of an\nallowance on PCD loans.

Effective risk management involves\noptimizing risk and return while operating in\na safe and sound manner, and promoting\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The Company\u2019s risk management\nframework promotes the execution of business\nstrategies and objectives in alignment with\nits risk appetite.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 61\nTruist has developed and employs a risk\ntaxonomy that further guides business\nfunctions in identifying, measuring,\nresponding to, monitoring, and reporting on\npossible exposures to the organization. The\nrisk taxonomy drives internal risk\nconversations and enables Truist to clearly\nand transparently communicate to stakeholders\nthe level of potential risk the Company faces,\nboth presently and in the future, and the\nCompany\u2019s position on managing risk to\nacceptable levels.\n\nTruist is committed to fostering a culture\nthat supports identification and escalation of\nrisks across the organization. All teammates\nare responsible for upholding the Company\u2019s\npurpose, mission, and values, and are\nencouraged to speak up if there is any\nactivity or behavior that is inconsistent with\nthe Company\u2019s culture. The Truist code of\nethics guides the Company\u2019s decision making\nand informs teammates on how to act in the\nabsence of specific guidance.\n\nTruist seeks an appropriate return for the\nrisk taken in its business operations. Risk-\ntaking activities are evaluated and\nprioritized to identify those that present\nattractive risk-adjusted returns, while\npreserving asset value and capital.\n\nCompensation decisions take into account a\nteammate\u2019s adherence to and successful\nimplementation of Truist\u2019s risk values and\nassociated policies and procedures. The\nCompany\u2019s compensation structure supports its\ncore values and sound risk management\npractices in an effort to promote judicious\nrisk-taking behavior.\n\nTruist employs a comprehensive change\nmanagement program to manage the risks\nassociated with integrating heritage BB&T and\nheritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive\nLeadership oversee the change management\nprogram, which is designed to ensure key\ndecisions are reviewed and that there is\nappropriate oversight of integration\nactivities.\n\nTruist\u2019s purpose, mission, and values are the\nfoundation for the risk management framework\nutilized at Truist and therefore serve as the\nbasis on which the risk appetite and risk\nstrategy are built. Truist\u2019s RMO provides\nindependent oversight and guidance for risk-\ntaking across the enterprise. In keeping with\nthe belief that consistent values drive long-\nterm behaviors, Truist\u2019s RMO has established\nthe following risk values which guide\nteammates\u2019 day-to-day activities:\n\n\u2022 Managing risk is the responsibility of every\nteammate.\n\n\u2022 Proactively identifying risk and managing\nthe inherent risks of their businesses is the\nresponsibility of the business units.\n\n\u2022 Managing risk with a balanced approach which\nincludes quality, profitability, and growth.\n\n\u2022 Measuring what is managed and managing what\nis measured.\n\n\u2022 Utilizing sound and consistent risk\nmanagement practices.\n\n\u2022 Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and\nqualitatively.\n\n\u2022 Realizing lower cost of capital from high\nquality risk management.\n\nTruist places significant emphasis on risk\nmanagement oversight and maintains a separate\nBoard-level Risk Committee, which assists the\nBoard in its oversight of the Company\u2019s risk\nmanagement function. The Committee is\nresponsible for approving and periodically\nreviewing the Company\u2019s risk management\nframework and risk management policies as well\nas monitoring the Company\u2019s risk profile,\napproving risk appetite statements, and\nproviding input to management regarding\nTruist\u2019s risk appetite and risk profile.\n\nThe RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible\nfor overseeing the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring, management, and\nreporting of risk. The CRO has direct access\nto the Board to communicate any risk issues\n(current or emerging) as well as the\nperformance of the risk management activities\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\nAs illustrated below, the risk management\nframework is supported by three lines of\ndefense. The following figure describes the\nroles of the three lines of defense:\n\n62 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist\u2019s Risk Governance framework is designed\nto provide comprehensive Board and Executive\nLeadership risk oversight, maintaining a\ncommittee governance structure that is\ndesigned to ensure alignment and execution of\nthe risk management framework. The committee\nstructure provides a mechanism to allow for\nefficient aggregation and escalation of risk\ninformation from the business units up to the\nrisk programs, Executive Leadership and\nultimately the Board.\n\nThe executive level committees include the\nERC, ECRC, MRLCC, EBPCC, TMC, and DC, each of\nwhich is chaired by a member of Executive\nLeadership. These committees provide oversight\nof each of the primary risk types.\n\nThe ERC establishes a fully integrated view of\nrisks across the company, provides broad\nstrategic oversight of all risk types, and\noversees corporate-wide strategies for\nidentifying, assessing, controlling,\nmeasuring, monitoring, and reporting risk at\nthe enterprise level. The ERC is responsible\nfor maintaining an effective risk management\nframework and monitoring its adoption and\nexecution across the enterprise. The ERC is\nchaired by the CRO and its membership includes\nall members of Executive Leadership and the\nGeneral Auditor.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 63\nThe principal types of inherent risk include\nclimate, market, credit, liquidity,\ncompliance, strategic, reputational,\noperational, and technology risks. The\nfollowing is a discussion of these risks.\n                                              \n  Climate Risk                                \n                                              \nClimate risk includes the risks arising from a\nchanging climate and the economic activities\nor trends resulting from the mitigation of\nclimate change. These risks are classified\ninto two categories, physical risks, resulting\nfrom acute weather events and chronic changes\nin climate conditions; as well as, transition\nrisks, related to the changing economic\nconditions resulting from the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy.\n\nDuring 2021, Truist expanded its risk\nmanagement teams and created a dedicated\nclimate risk management function that seeks to\nidentify and evaluate climate risks and\nopportunities, and integrate them into the\nCompany\u2019s risk management framework and\nstrategic plans. Truist has conducted initial\nassessments of its exposure to various forms\nof climate risk including flooding, hurricane\nwind, and wildfire risks facing the real\nestate secured portfolios. Transition risks\nfacing Truist\u2019s commercial clients have also\nbeen evaluated against key risk drivers\nincluding, stakeholders, legal, regulatory,\nand technology. These risk assessments and\nbroader climate scenario analysis will\ncontinue to be refined while climate risk\nrelated metrics are developed and incorporated\ninto risk monitoring processes across the\nCompany.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, or economic\nvalue arising from changes in the market value\nof portfolios, securities, or other financial\ninstruments. Market risk results from changes\nin the level, volatility, or correlations\namong financial market risk factors or prices,\nincluding interest rates, credit spreads,\nforeign exchange rates, equity, and commodity\nprices.\n\nEffective management of market risk is\nessential to achieving Truist\u2019s strategic\nfinancial objectives. Truist\u2019s most\nsignificant market risk exposure is to\ninterest rate risk in its balance sheet;\nhowever, market risk also results from\nunderlying product liquidity risk, price risk,\nand volatility risk in Truist\u2019s business\nunits. Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTo keep net interest margin as stable as\npossible, Truist actively manages its interest\nrate risk exposure through the strategic\nrepricing of its assets and liabilities,\ntaking into account the volumes, maturities,\nand mix. Truist primarily uses three methods\nto measure and monitor its interest rate risk:\n(i) simulations of possible changes to net\ninterest income over the next two years based\non gradual changes in interest rates; (ii)\nanalysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and\n(iii) analysis of economic value of equity\nbased on changes in interest rates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s simulation model takes into\naccount assumptions related to prepayment\ntrends, using a combination of market data and\ninternal historical experiences for deposits\nand loans, as well as scheduled maturities and\npayments, and the expected outlook for the\neconomy and interest rates. These assumptions\nare reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect\nchanges in current interest rates compared to\nthe rates applicable to Truist\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. The model also considers Truist\u2019s\ncurrent and prospective liquidity position,\ncurrent balance sheet volumes, projected\ngrowth and/or contractions, accessibility of\nfunds for short-term needs and capital\nmaintenance.\n\nDeposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate\nchanges relative to market rate changes) are\nan important assumption in the interest rate\nrisk modeling process. Truist applies deposit\nbeta assumptions to non-maturity interest-\nbearing deposit accounts when determining its\ninterest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity,\ninterest-bearing deposit accounts include\ninterest checking accounts, savings accounts,\nand money market accounts that do not have a\ncontractual maturity. Truist utilizes a tiered\ndeposit beta assumption framework that\naccounts for historically observed behaviors\nof clients and the Company. The deposit beta\nassumptions are reduced when interest rates\nare exceptionally low and competition for\ninterest-bearing deposits is commensurately\nlow. As interest rates rise, the deposit beta\nassumptions also rise to reflect increasing\ncompetition among banks as well as increased\nclient demand for interest-bearing deposits.\nTruist applies an average deposit beta of\napproximately 25% for the first 100 basis\npoint increase in the Federal funds rate,\napproximately 35% for the second 100 basis\npoint increase, and approximately 50% for any\nadditional increases. Truist also regularly\nconducts sensitivity analyses on other key\nvariables, including noninterest-bearing\ndeposits, to determine the impact these\nvariables could have on the Company\u2019s interest\nrate risk position. The predictive value of\nthe simulation model depends upon the accuracy\nof the assumptions, but management believes\nthat it provides helpful information for the\nmanagement of interest rate risk.\n\n64 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe following table shows the effect that the\nindicated changes in interest rates would have\non net interest income as projected for the\nnext 12 months assuming a gradual change in\ninterest rates as described below.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                         \u2026                    \n                                %        \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2014    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                         \u2026    \n                                              \n(1) The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at\none basis point and may not reflect Down 25\nand 50 basis points for all rate indices.\n\nTruist has established parameters related to\ninterest rate sensitivity measures that\nprescribe a maximum negative impact on net\ninterest income under different interest rate\nscenarios that would result in an escalation\nto the Board. The following parameters and\ninterest rate scenarios are considered\nTruist\u2019s primary measures of interest rate\nrisk:\n\n\u2022 Maximum decrease in net interest income of\n7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25\nbasis point change in interest rates each\nquarter for four quarters; and a\n\n\u2022 Maximum decrease in net interest income of\n10% for the next 12 months assuming an\nimmediate 100 basis point parallel shock\nchange in interest rates. This interest rate\nshock analysis is designed to create an outer\nbound of acceptable interest rate risk.\n\nManagement considers how the interest rate\nrisk position could be impacted by changes in\nbalance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking\nindustry has been very strong during the\ncurrent economic cycle. Much of this liquidity\nincrease has resulted in growth in\nnoninterest-bearing demand deposits.\nConsistent with the industry, Truist has seen\na significant increase in this funding source.\nThe behavior of these deposits is one of the\nmost important assumptions used in determining\nthe interest rate risk position of Truist. A\ndecrease in the amount of these deposits in\nthe future would reduce the asset sensitivity\nof Truist\u2019s balance sheet because the Company\nmay increase interest-bearing funds to offset\nthe loss of this advantageous funding source.\nAlternatively, the Company may reduce the size\nof its investment portfolio to offset the loss\nof noninterest-bearing demand deposits to\nlimit the impact on the balance sheet\u2019s asset\nsensitivity.\n\nThe following table shows the results of\nTruist\u2019s interest-rate sensitivity position\nassuming the loss of demand deposits and an\nassociated increase in managed rate deposits\nunder various scenarios. For purposes of this\nanalysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta\nof managed rate deposits for the replacement\nof the demand deposits at 100%.\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  33:                                         \n  Depo\u2026                                       \n  Mix                                         \n  Sens\u2026                                       \n  Anal\u2026                                       \n             Base       Resul\u2026                \n  Grad\u2026    Scena\u2026       Assum\u2026                \n  Chan\u2026        at            a                \n  in       Decem\u2026       Decre\u2026                \n  Rates       31,           in                \n  (bps)      2021       Nonin\u2026                \n              (1)       Demand                \n                        Depos\u2026                \n              $20          $40                \n           Billi\u2026       Billi\u2026                \n  Up         5.18  %      4.33  %    3.49  %  \n  100                                         \n  Up 50      3.94         3.32       2.70     \n                                              \n(1) The base scenario is equal to the\nannualized hypothetical percentage change in\nnet interest income at December 31, 2021 as\npresented in the preceding table.\n\nTruist uses financial instruments including\nderivatives to manage interest rate risk\nrelated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs,\nand mortgage banking operations, long-term\ndebt, and other funding sources. Truist hedges\na portion of its AFS securities to reduce\nmark-to-market volatility within AOCI and also\nto increase its overall asset sensitivity\nposition. Truist also uses derivatives to\nfacilitate transactions on behalf of its\nclients and as part of associated hedging\nactivities. As of December 31, 2021, Truist\nhad derivative financial instruments\noutstanding with notional amounts totaling\n$300.6 billion, with an associated net fair\nvalue of $1.8 billion. See \u201cNote 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d for\nadditional disclosures.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 65\n                                              \n  LIBOR Transition                            \n                                              \nLIBOR in its current form will no longer be\navailable after 2021. For most tenors of U.S.\ndollar LIBOR, the administrator of LIBOR\nextended publication until June 30, 2023.\nTenors used infrequently by Truist, including\none week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR and\nall non-U.S. dollar LIBOR, ceased publication\nat December 31, 2021, based on the October 20,\n2021 interagency Joint Statement on Managing\nthe LIBOR transition. To prepare for the\ntransition to an alternative reference rate,\nmanagement formed a cross-functional project\nteam to address the LIBOR transition. The\nproject team performed an assessment to\nidentify the potential risks related to the\ntransition from LIBOR to a new index or\nmultiple indices and provides updates to\nExecutive Leadership and the Board. As of\nDecember 2021, Truist had outstanding LIBOR-\nbased instruments that mature after June 30,\n2023, including: loan and lease exposures\ntotaling approximately $151 billion, notional\nderivative exposure totaling approximately\n$131 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion,\nand preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These\namounts are inclusive of remediated contracts,\nwhich contain adequate fallback language for\nthe transition.\n\nContract fallback language for existing loans\nand leases has largely been reviewed and\ncertain contracts will require amendments to\nsupport the transition away from LIBOR. For\nimpacted lines of business, the Company has\nstarted remediating these contracts to include\nstandardized fallback language. Current\nfallback language used for new, renewed, and\nmodified contracts is generally consistent\nwith ARRC recommendations and includes use of\n\u201chardwired fallback\u201d language, where\nappropriate.\n\nThe progress and approach to remediation will\nvary based on the type of contract and\nexisting language used in the agreement. For\ncommercial lending and general consumer\nlending, a significant number of remaining\nLIBOR contracts will require client outreach\nand remediation. Efforts to amend and\nremediate contracts, excluding mortgage and\nstudent loans, that mature post June 30, 2023\n($141 billion) will be accelerated in 2022.\nTruist has determined that adjustable rate\nmortgage products ($4.3 billion) have\nconsistent and adequate fallback language to\ntransition away from LIBOR in line with\nindustry expectations; therefore, these\ncontracts will not require remediation.\nRemediation of student loans ($6.1 billion)\nwill depend on guidance from the Department of\nEducation and recent guidance from the CFPB to\nallow transition to \u201ccomparable rates,\u201d\nincluding SOFR or Prime. Derivatives will\nutilize recent New York legislation to support\ntransition of trades to follow the ISDA\nProtocol (where counterparties have not\nalready adhered to the protocol). Truist will\nevaluate legislation being considered in 2022\nto further support the transition away from\nLIBOR. This legislation may provide additional\nadministrative benefit for a small portion of\nthe commercial and consumer lending portfolios\nwhere contracts do not contain fallback\nlanguage.\n\nTraining has been provided for impacted\nteammates and will continue during 2022.\nTruist will continue to provide timely notices\nand information to impacted clients about the\ntransition during 2022 and the first half of\n2023. Truist continues to manage the impact of\nthese contracts and other financial\ninstruments, systems implications, hedging\nstrategies, and related operational and market\nrisks on established project plans for\nbusiness and operational readiness to support\nthe transition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased\nentering into new contracts with a LIBOR\nreference rate for all product offerings,\nexcept on a limited basis, as permissible.\nMarket risks associated with this change are\ndependent on the alternative reference rates\navailable and market conditions as of the\ntransition. The Company is actively using SOFR\nas a reference rate and has originated\napproximately $18.3 billion of loans, issued\n$5.0 billion of long-term debt, and has $44.9\nbillion in notional derivative exposure using\nthis alternative reference rate as of December\n31, 2021. Truist expects SOFR to become a more\ncommonly-used pricing benchmark across the\nindustry and will continue to offer additional\nSOFR based products during 2022. Additional\nalternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg\nShort Term Bank Yield will be supported based\non market demand. Other emerging credit\nsensitive rates will be evaluated as\nadditional alternatives for LIBOR based on\nmarket developments.

Risk\nFactors.\u201d\n                                              \n  Market risk from trading activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel, which is intended to ensure that\nexposures are in line with Truist\u2019s risk\nappetite.\n\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\n66 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule was\n$51 million, all of which were non-agency\nasset backed securities positions. Consistent\nwith the Market Risk Rule requirements, the\nCompany performs pre-purchase due diligence on\neach securitization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of December 31, 2021.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDuring 2021, average one and ten day VaR\nmeasures declined from last year as heightened\nmarket volatility experienced during March\n2020 aged out of the 12-month VaR look-back\nwindow.\n                                              \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026                                       \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026                          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n                   \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n                $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  \n                   \u2026       4       \u2026       6  \n                   3       1       3       1  \n                   \u2026       5       \u2026       7  \n                                              \n                           3               2  \n                           5               9  \n                           1               2  \n                           \u2014               \u2014  \n                           \u2026               \u2026  \n                           5               7  \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 67\nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended December 31,\n2021. The total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n\n68 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nModel Risk Management\n\nMRM is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRM policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models are reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and to identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for historical repeats and\nhypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, which is intended to\nensure that both current and emerging risks\nare captured appropriately. Management also\nutilizes stress analyses to support the\nCompany\u2019s capital adequacy assessment\nstandards. See the \u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A\nfor additional discussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nCredit risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nthe default, inability or unwillingness of a\nborrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the\nterms of any financial obligation to Truist or\notherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk\nexists in all activities where success depends\non the performance of a borrower, obligor, or\ncounterparty. Credit risk arises when Truist\nfunds are extended, committed, invested, or\notherwise exposed through actual or implied\ncontractual agreements, whether on or off-\nbalance sheet. Credit risk increases when the\ncredit quality of an issuer whose securities\nor other instruments the bank holds\ndeteriorates.\n\nTruist has established the following general\npractices to manage credit risk:\n\n\u2022 limiting the amount of credit that\nindividual lenders may extend to a borrower;\n\n\u2022 establishing a process for credit approval\naccountability;\n\n\u2022 careful initial underwriting and analysis of\nborrower, transaction, market and collateral\nrisks;\n\n\u2022 ongoing servicing and monitoring of\nindividual loans and lending relationships;\n\n\u2022 continuous monitoring of the portfolio,\nmarket dynamics and the economy; and\n\n\u2022 periodically reevaluating the Company\u2019s\nstrategy and overall exposure as economic,\nmarket and other relevant conditions change.\n\nThe following discussion describes the\nunderwriting procedures and overall risk\nmanagement of Truist\u2019s lending function.\n\nUnderwriting Approach\n\nThe loan portfolio is a primary source of\nprofitability and risk; therefore, proper loan\nunderwriting is critical to Truist\u2019s long-term\nfinancial success. Truist\u2019s underwriting\napproach is designed to define acceptable\ncombinations of specific risk-mitigating\nfeatures that promote credit relationships\nthat conform to Truist\u2019s risk philosophy.\nProvided below is a summary of the most\nsignificant underwriting criteria used to\nevaluate new loans and loan renewals:\n\n\u2022 Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash\nflow adequacy is a necessary condition of\ncreditworthiness, meaning that loans must\neither be clearly supported by a borrower's\ncash flow or, if not, must be justified by\nsecondary repayment sources.\n\n\u2022 Secondary sources of repayment - alternative\nrepayment funds are a significant risk-\nmitigating factor as long as they are liquid,\ncan be easily accessed, and provide adequate\nresources to supplement the primary cash flow\nsource.\n\n\u2022 Value of any underlying collateral - loans\nare generally secured by the asset being\nfinanced. Because an analysis of the primary\nand secondary sources of repayment is the most\nimportant factor, collateral, unless it is\nliquid, does not justify loans that cannot be\nserviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 Overall creditworthiness of the client,\ntaking into account the client's\nrelationships, both past and current, with\nTruist and other lenders - Truist\u2019s success\ndepends on building lasting and mutually\nbeneficial relationships with clients, which\ninvolves assessing their financial position\nand background.\n\n\u2022 Level of equity invested in the transaction\n- in general, borrowers are required to\ncontribute or invest a portion of their own\nfunds prior to any loan advances.\n\nRefer to the \"Lending Activities\" section in\nMD&A for a discussion of each loan and lease\nportfolio.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 69\n                                              \n  Liquidity Risk                              \n                                              \nLiquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist\nwill be unable to meet its obligations as they\ncome due because of an inability to obtain\nadequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or\n(ii) Truist cannot easily unwind or offset\nspecific exposures without significantly\nlowering market prices because of inadequate\nmarket depth or market disruptions (market\nliquidity risk). Refer to the \"Liquidity\u201d\nsection in MD&A for additional discussion.\n                                              \n  Compliance Risk                             \n                                              \nCompliance risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\nviolations of laws, rules, or regulations, or\nfrom non-conformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies and procedures or\nethical standards. This risk exposes Truist to\nfines, civil monetary penalties, payment of\ndamages, and the voiding of contracts.\nCompliance risk can result in diminished\nreputation, reduced franchise or enterprise\nvalue, limited business opportunities and\nlessened expansion potential.\n                                              \n  Strategic Risk                              \n                                              \nStrategic risk is the risk of financial loss,\ndiminished stakeholder confidence, or negative\nimpact to human capital resulting from\nineffective strategy setting and execution,\nadverse business decisions, or lack of\nresponsiveness to changes in the banking\nindustry and operating environment. Truist is\ncommitted to fulfilling its overall strategic\nobjectives by selecting business strategies\nand operating businesses in a manner\nconsistent with achieving\nprofitability/earnings growth and maintaining\nstrong confidence and trust with its key\nstakeholder constituencies.\n                                              \n  Reputation Risk                             \n                                              \nReputation risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings, capital, enterprise\nvalue, the Truist brand, and public confidence\narising from negative publicity or public\nopinion, whether real or perceived, regarding\nTruist\u2019s business practices, products,\nservices, transactions, or other activities\nundertaken by Truist, its representatives, or\nits partners. A negative reputation may impair\nTruist\u2019s relationship with clients, teammates,\ncommunities, or shareholders, and it is often\na residual risk that arises when other risks\nare not managed properly.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nOperational risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital arising from\ninadequate or failed internal processes,\npeople, and systems or from external events.\nIt includes legal risk, which is the risk of\nloss arising from defective transactions,\nlitigation or claims made, or the failure to\nadequately protect company-owned assets. An\noperational loss occurs when an event results\nin a loss or reserve originating from\noperational risk.\n\nModel Risk\n\nModel risk is the risk to current or\nanticipated earnings or capital from decisions\nbased on incorrect or misused model outputs.\nTruist uses models for many purposes,\nincluding the valuation of financial\npositions, estimation of credit losses, and\nthe measurement of risk. Valuation models are\nused to value certain financial instruments\nfor which quoted prices may not be readily\navailable. Valuation models are also used as\ninputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself,\nregulatory capital, stress testing, and the\nACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs,\nwho are responsible for the development,\nimplementation, and use of their models.\nOversight of these functions is performed by\nthe MRM, which is a component of the RMO. Once\nmodels have been approved, model owners are\nresponsible for the maintenance of an\nappropriate operating environment and must\nmonitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on a recurring basis. Models are\nupdated in response to changes in portfolio\ncomposition, industry and economic conditions,\ntechnological capabilities and other\ndevelopments.\n\nMRM manages model risk in a holistic manner\nthrough a suite of model governance and model\nvalidation activities. The risk of each model\nis assessed and classified into various risk\ntiers. Additionally, MRM maintains an\nenterprise-wide model inventory containing\nrelevant model information. Regarding model\nvalidation, MRM utilizes internal validation\nanalysts and managers with skill sets in\npredictive modeling to perform detailed\nreviews of model development, implementation,\nand conceptual soundness. On certain\noccasions, the MRM will also engage external\nparties to assist with validation efforts.\nOnce in a production environment, MRM assesses\na model\u2019s performance on a periodic basis\nthrough ongoing monitoring reviews. MRM tracks\nissues that have been identified during model\nvalidation or through ongoing monitoring, and\nengages with model owners to ensure their\ntimely remediation. MRM gauges model risk\nutilizing a collection of key risk indicators,\nwhich are periodically reported to relevant\ncommittees, including but not limited to, the\nModel Risk Management Committee as well as the\nBoard Risk Committee. MRM will also present\nmodel risk topics to the Board Risk Committee\nas necessary.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  Technology Risk                             \n                                              \nTechnology risk is the business risk\nassociated with the use, ownership, operation,\ninvolvement, influence, and adoption of\ninformation technology across the Company.\nTruist has defined and adopted a technology\nrisk framework that provides the foundation\nfor technology risk strategy, program, and\noversight and defines key objectives,\noperating model components, risk domains, and\ncapabilities to manage this risk.\n\nMerger Integration Risk\n\nThe Truist Merger Program was designed to\nensure successful integration following the\nMerger through strong governance practices and\ncontrols, with processes, metrics and\nreporting exemplifying a strong risk culture.\nThe core Truist Merger Program structure\nconsists of key stakeholders from each line of\nbusiness. Integration activities and risk\nmitigation are monitored through established\nworkgroups and Truist Merger Program\nleadership, with oversight and escalation into\nthe Merger Oversight Committee (as the primary\ncommittee), TMC, and Board Technology\nCommittee.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nThe technology landscape is constantly\nevolving, and new and unforeseen threats and\nactions by others may disrupt operations or\nresult in losses beyond Truist\u2019s risk control\nthresholds. Truist maintains a comprehensive\nrisk-based information security /\ncybersecurity framework implemented through\npeople, processes, and technology whereby\nTruist actively monitors and evaluates\nthreats, events, and the performance of its\nbusiness operations and continually adapts its\nrisk mitigation activities accordingly.\n\nTruist\u2019s framework aligns with those of the\nNational Institute of Standards and\nTechnology, the International Standards\nOrganization 27000 series, the IT Governance\nInstitute, and the Control Objectives for\nInformation and Related Technology, as well as\nconforms with the requirements and guidance\nfrom applicable regulatory authorities,\nincluding the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council. In addition, Truist\u2019s\nframework, which includes internally and\nexternally focused capabilities, drives the\ndevelopment and implementation of Truist\u2019s\ndata security strategy that is designed to\nreduce risk while enabling Truist\u2019s corporate\nbusiness objectives.\n\nTruist has built an organization with\ndedicated, skilled talent to operationalize\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity strategy. The\ncybersecurity strategy is enabled by\ncontinuous enhancement of Truist\u2019s\nmultilayered defenses including advanced\ncapabilities for early and rapid cyber threat\nidentification, detection, protection,\nresponse, and recovery. Truist participates in\nthe federally recognized Financial Services\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center as a\nkey part of the Company\u2019s cyber threat\nintelligence and response programs, as well as\nother industry organizations and initiatives\nthat promote industry best practices such as\nharmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber\nreadiness, and secure consumer financial data\nsharing.\n\nTo further mitigate the risks presented by an\nevolving cyber threat landscape, Truist\nprovides data protection guidance to clients\nand promotes data protection awareness and\naccountability through mandatory teammate\ntraining. Truist conducts scenario-driven test\nexercises simulating impacts and consequences\ndeveloped through analysis of real-world\ntechnology incidents as well as known and\nanticipated cyber threats. These exercises are\ndesigned to assess the viability of Truist\u2019s\ncrisis response and management programs and\nprovide the basis for continuous improvement.\n\nTruist\u2019s cybersecurity risk program is\noverseen by Executive Leadership and the\nBoard. Regular updates on the status of the\ncybersecurity risk program, including\ninformation security risks and incidents,\nemerging threats, and control environment, are\naggregated and escalated to Executive\nLeadership and the Board. Additionally, Truist\nhas a Cyber Incident Response Team that\nmanages significant cyber-specific events with\nescalation up to Executive Leadership and the\nBoard. Truist\u2019s framework requires annual\nexercises at a minimum to test Truist\u2019s\npreparedness. The Board devotes significant\ntime and attention to its oversight of cyber\nsecurity risk and approves related information\nsecurity policies. Although Truist has\ninvested substantial resources to manage and\nreduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible\nto completely eliminate this risk. Truist\nobtains insurance that protects against\ncertain losses, expenses, and damages\nassociated with cybersecurity risk. See Item\n1A, \"Risk Factors,\" for additional information\nregarding cybersecurity risk.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS\nsecurities, other factors affect the ability\nto meet liquidity needs, including access to a\nvariety of funding sources, maintaining\nborrowing capacity, growing core deposits,\nloan repayment, and the ability to securitize\nor package loans for sale.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs against 30 days of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\nensure a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities.\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is designed to ensure\nthat Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient\nliquidity for a variety of institution-\nspecific and market-wide adverse scenarios.\nEach liquidity stress test scenario applies\ndefined assumptions to execute sources and\nuses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include deposit\nattrition, contractual maturities, reductions\nin unsecured and secured funding, and\nincreased draws on unfunded commitments. To\nmitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has\nidentified sources of liquidity; however,\naccess to these sources of liquidity could be\naffected within a stressed environment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected net\nstressed cash-flow needs and maintain\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. The\nliquidity buffer consists of unencumbered\nhighly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s liquidity\nbuffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto ensure that liquidity sources are\nsufficient to meet ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization's\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other critical teammates to follow in the\nevent of a liquidity contraction or in\nanticipation of such an event. The plan\naddresses authority for activation and\ndecision making, liquidity options, and the\nresponsibilities of key departments in the\nevent of a liquidity contraction.\n\nLCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $86.7 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 114% for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2021.\n\nEffective July 2021, Truist became subject to\nfinal rules implementing the NSFR, which are\ndesigned to ensure that banking organizations\nmaintain a stable, long-term funding profile\nin relation to their asset composition and\noff-balance sheet activities. At December 31,\n2021, the Company was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window.

The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on long-term debt. See \u201cNote 22.\nParent Company Financial Information\u201d for\nadditional information regarding dividends\nfrom subsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows. Truist\nmaintains a significant buffer above the\nprojected one year of cash outflows. In\ndetermining the buffer, Truist considers cash\nrequirements for common and preferred\ndividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates,\nserving as a source of strength to Truist\nBank, and being able to withstand sustained\nmarket disruptions that could limit access to\nthe capital markets. At December 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Parent Company had 35\nmonths and 43 months, respectively, of cash on\nhand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and\n19 months and 22 months, respectively, when\nincluding the payment of common stock\ndividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" for additional\ninformation regarding factors that influence\ncredit ratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings.\n\nThe following table presents the credit\nratings and outlooks of Truist and Truist Bank\nas of December 31, 2021:\n                                              \n  Tab\u2026                                        \n  36:                                         \n  Cre\u2026                                        \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  of                                          \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  and                                         \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Bank                                        \n          Moody\u2026    S&P      Fitch     DBRS   \n                                       Morn\u2026  \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Fin\u2026                                        \n  Cor\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A3        A- /     A+ /      AH /   \n                    A-2      F1        R-1L   \n  Sen\u2026    A3        A-       A         AH     \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Sub\u2026    A3        BBB+     A-        A      \n  Pre\u2026    Baa2(\u2026    BBB-     BBB       BBBH   \n  sto\u2026                                        \n  Tru\u2026                                        \n  Ban\u2026                                        \n  Iss\u2026    A2        A /      A+ /      AAL /  \n                    A-1      F1        R-1M   \n  Sen\u2026    A2        A        A+        AAL    \n  uns\u2026                                        \n  Dep\u2026    Aa3 /     NA       AA- /     AAL    \n          P-1                F1+              \n  Sub\u2026    (P) A2    A-       A         AH     \n  Rat\u2026                                        \n  out\u2026                                        \n  Cre\u2026    Stable    Posi\u2026    Stable    Posi\u2026  \n  tre\u2026                                        \n                                              \n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nRecent changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings\nand outlooks include:\n\n\u2022 On May 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings affirmed the\nratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised\nthe ratings outlook to \u201cstable\u201d from\n\u201cnegative\u201d based on the view that the\nCompany\u2019s diverse business model and solid\nstrategy execution will drive stable earnings\nperformance, and on increased confidence in a\nU.S. economic recovery.\n\n\u2022 On May 24, 2021, S&P Global Ratings affirmed\nthe ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nrevised its ratings outlook to \u201cpositive\u201d from\n\u201cstable,\u201d citing stabilization in U.S.\neconomic trends and the easing of industry\nrisk in the U.S. banking system, and noting\nthat the merger of equals provides better\ndiversity and market position, and could\ngenerate higher earnings power, financial\nflexibility, and technology, providing the\nCompany with a sustainable competitive\nadvantage.\n\n\u2022 On June 10, 2021, DBRS Morningstar confirmed\nthe ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and\nrevised the trend for all ratings to\n\u201cpositive\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d, reflecting the\nCompany\u2019s substantial progress with the merger\nintegration and the view that the impact of\nthe economic fallout from the coronavirus\npandemic will continue to be manageable.\n\n\u2022 On July 12, 2021, Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nupgraded Truist Bank\u2019s long-term subordinated\ndebt rating to A2 from A3, and downgraded\nTruist Bank\u2019s long-term bank deposit rating to\nAa3 from Aa2, following revisions to Moody\u2019s\nadvanced loss given failure analysis that were\npublished in its updated Banks methodology on\nJuly 9, 2021.\n\n\u2022 On December 7, 2021, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService released ESG Issuer Profile Scores\n(IPS) and Credit Impact Scores (CIS) to assist\nin demonstrating the impact of ESG on credit\nratings. IPS assess an issuer\u2019s exposure to\nthe risk categories in Moody\u2019s ESG\nclassification system from a credit\nperspective. CIS indicate the extent to which\nESG factors impacted the issuer\u2019s credit\nratings. Consistent with most other banks,\nTruist was assigned an IPS of E-3, S-4, and\nG-2, and a CIS of CIS-2, the latter indicating\nthat ESG attributes had a neutral-to-low\nimpact on Truist\u2019s current ratings.\n\n\u2022 On January 19, 2022, S&P Global Ratings\npublished Truist\u2019s assigned ESG Credit\nIndicators of E-2, S-2, and G-2, which were\nconsistent with the scores assigned to most\nother banks and which indicated that\nenvironmental, social and governance factors\nhave \u201cno material influence\u201d on the rating\nagency\u2019s analysis of the Company.\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are adequate to meet Truist\u2019s\ncurrent requirements and plans for continued\ngrowth. As of December 31, 2021, the Company\nhad $1.9 billion in obligations to purchase\ngoods or services that are enforceable and\nlegally binding. Many of the purchase\nobligations have terms that are not fixed and\ndeterminable and are included in the total\namount of obligations based upon the estimated\ntiming and amount of payment. In addition,\ncertain of the purchase agreements contain\nclauses that would allow Truist to cancel the\nagreement with specified notice; however, that\nimpact is not included in determining the\ntotal amount of obligations. See \"Note 9.\nOther Assets and Liabilities,\" \"Note 11.\nBorrowings,\" and \"Note 16. Commitments and\nContingencies\" for additional information\nregarding outstanding balances of sources of\nliquidity and contractual commitments and\nobligations.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s overriding policy is\nto maintain capital at levels that are in\nexcess of internal capital targets, which are\nabove the regulatory \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nminimums. Management evaluates whether capital\nratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above minimums specified by the FRB for\nthe annual CCAR process. Breaches of minimum\ntargets prompt a review of the planned capital\nactions included in Truist\u2019s capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB of 2.5% applicable to\nTruist as of December 31, 2021.

In addition,\nmanagement closely monitors the Parent\nCompany\u2019s double leverage ratio (investments\nin subsidiaries as a percentage of\nshareholders' equity). The active management\nof the subsidiaries' equity capital is the\nprocess used to manage this important driver\nof Parent Company liquidity and is a key\nelement in the management of Truist\u2019s capital\nposition.\n\nManagement intends to maintain capital at\nTruist Bank at levels that will result in\nclassification as \"well-capitalized\" for\nregulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is\nmanagement's intent to maintain Truist Bank's\ncapital at levels that result in regulatory\nrisk-based capital ratios that are generally\ncomparable with peers of similar size,\ncomplexity, and risk profile. If the capital\nlevels of Truist Bank increase above these\nguidelines, excess capital may be transferred\nto the Parent Company in the form of special\ndividend payments, subject to regulatory and\nother operating considerations.\n\nManagement's capital deployment plan in order\nof preference is to focus on (i) organic\ngrowth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic\nopportunities and/or share repurchases\ndepending on opportunities in the marketplace\nand Truist\u2019s interest and ability to proceed\nwith acquisitions.\n\nTruist Bank's capital ratios are presented in\nthe following table:\n                                              \n  Table 40: Capital                           \n  Ratios -

These measures are useful for\nevaluating the performance of a business\nconsistently, whether acquired or developed\ninternally. Truist\u2019s management uses these\nmeasures to assess the quality of capital and\nreturns relative to balance sheet risk. These\ncapital measures are not necessarily\ncomparable to similar capital measures that\nmay be presented by other companies.\n\nTruist\u2019s capital level at December 31, 2021\nremains strong compared to the regulatory\nlevels for well capitalized banks. Truist\u2019s\nCET1 ratio was 9.6% as of December 31, 2021.\nThe decline compared to the 2020 CET1 ratio\nreflects capital deployed through the\nacquisitions of Service Finance, LLC and\nConstellation Affiliated Partners, the\nrepurchase of common stock, and loan growth in\nthe fourth quarter of 2021 driving an increase\nin risk-weighted assets. Truist increased\ncommon dividends 7% to $0.48 per share\nstarting in the third quarter of 2021. During\n2021, Truist paid $2.5 billion in common stock\ndividends or $1.86 per share, and repurchased\n$1.6 billion of common stock. Truist also\nredeemed $1.4 billion of preferred stock to\noptimize the Company\u2019s capital position. The\ndividend payout ratio for 2021 was 41%\ncompared to 58% for the prior year. The total\npayout ratio for 2021 was 68% compared to 58%\nfor the prior year, reflecting the resumption\nof share repurchases during the year. In early\n2022, Truist declared common dividends of\n$0.48 per share for the first quarter of 2022,\nand announced the acquisition of Kensington\nVanguard National Land Services to expand IH\u2019s\ntitle insurance operation.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 75\n                                              \n  Reclassifications                           \n                                              \nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications\nhave been made to prior period information to\nconform to the current presentation. Such\nreclassifications had no effect on previously\nreported shareholders' equity or net income.\nRefer to \"Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" for\nadditional discussion regarding\nreclassifications.\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \nThe accounting and reporting policies of\nTruist are in accordance with GAAP and conform\nto the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The\nfinancial position and results of operations\nare affected by management's application of\naccounting policies, including estimates,\nassumptions and judgments made to arrive at\nthe carrying value of assets and liabilities\nand amounts reported for revenues and\nexpenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations and related disclosures.\nUnderstanding Truist\u2019s accounting policies is\nfundamental to understanding the consolidated\nfinancial position and consolidated results of\noperations. Accordingly, Truist\u2019s significant\naccounting policies and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\ndetail in \"Note 1. Basis of Presentation.\"\n\nThe following is a summary of Truist\u2019s\ncritical accounting policies that are highly\ndependent on estimates, assumptions, and\njudgments. These critical accounting policies\nare reviewed with the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors on a periodic basis.\n                                              \n  ACL                                         \n                                              \nTruist\u2019s ACL represents management's best\nestimate of expected future credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease portfolios and\noff-balance sheet lending commitments at the\nbalance sheet date. Estimates of expected\nfuture loan and lease losses are determined by\nusing statistical models and management\u2019s\njudgement. The models are designed to forecast\nprobability of default, exposure at default\nand loss given default by correlating certain\nmacroeconomic forecast data to historical\nexperience. The models are generally applied\nat the portfolio level to pools of loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics. The\nmacroeconomic data used in the models is based\non forecasted variables for the reasonable and\nsupportable period of two years. Beyond this\nforecast period the models gradually revert to\nlong-term historical loss conditions over a\none year period. As a means of addressing\nuncertainty related to future economic\nconditions, the quantitative allowance\nincludes an adjustment that reflects model\noutput calculated using a range of potential\nfuture economic conditions. Expected losses\nare estimated through contractual maturity,\ngiving appropriate consideration to expected\nprepayments unless the borrower has a right to\nrenew that is not cancellable or it is\nreasonably expected that the loan will be\nmodified as a TDR.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions, and considerations with\nrespect to the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.\n\nManagement considers a range of macroeconomic\nforecast data in connection with the allowance\nestimation process. Under the range of\nscenarios considered as of December 31, 2021,\nuse of the Company\u2019s pessimistic scenario\nwould have resulted in an increase to the\nmodeled allowance results of approximately\n$2.1 billion. This estimate reflects the\nsensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate\nto macroeconomic forecast data but does not\nconsider other qualitative adjustments that\ncould increase or decrease modeled loss\nestimates calculated using this alternative\neconomic scenario.\n\nThe Company individually evaluates expected\ncredits losses related to loans and leases\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics\nand loans that have been classified as a TDR.\nFor individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is\ndetermined through review of data specific to\nthe borrower and related collateral, if any,\nwhile for TDRs, default expectations and\nestimated prepayment speeds that are specific\nto each of the restructured loan populations\nare incorporated in the determination of the\nALLL.\n\nThe methodology used to determine an estimate\nfor the RUFC is similar to that used to\ndetermine the funded component of the ALLL and\nis measured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default. A detailed\ndiscussion of the methodology used in\ndetermining the ACL is included in \"Note 1.\nBasis of Presentation.\"\n                                              \n  Fair Value of Financial Instruments         \n                                              \nThe vast majority of assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis\nare based on either quoted market prices or\nmarket prices for similar instruments. Refer\nto \"Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures\" for\nadditional disclosures regarding the fair\nvalue of financial instruments and \"Note 2.\nBusiness Combinations\" for additional\ndisclosures regarding business combinations.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nSecurities\n\nTruist generally utilizes a third-party\npricing service in determining the fair value\nof its AFS investment securities, whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. Fair\nvalue measurements for investment securities\nare derived from market-based pricing matrices\nthat were developed using observable inputs\nthat include benchmark yields, benchmark\nsecurities, reported trades, offers, bids,\nissuer spreads, and broker quotes. Management\nperforms procedures to evaluate the fair\nvalues provided by the third-party service\nprovider. These procedures, which are\nperformed independent of the responsible\nbusiness unit, include comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third party\npricing service to other third-party pricing\nsources, review of additional information\nprovided by the third-party pricing service\nand other third-party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on security sales to the daily\npricing information received from the third-\nparty pricing service. The Enterprise\nValuation Committee, which provides oversight\nto Truist\u2019s enterprise-wide IPV function, is\nresponsible for the comparison of pricing\ninformation received from the third-party\npricing service or internally to other third-\nparty pricing sources, approving tolerance\nlimits determined by IPV for price comparison\nexceptions, reviewing significant changes to\npricing and valuation policies and reviewing\nand approving the pricing decisions made on\nany illiquid and hard-to-price securities.\nWhen market observable data is not available,\nwhich generally occurs due to the lack of\nliquidity or inactive markets for certain\nsecurities, the valuation of the security is\nsubjective and may involve substantial\njudgment by management to reflect unobservable\ninput assumptions.\n\nMSRs\n\nTruist\u2019s primary class of MSRs for which it\nseparately manages the economic risks relates\nto residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do\nnot trade in an active, open market with\nreadily observable prices. While sales of MSRs\ndo occur, the precise terms and conditions\ntypically are not readily available.\nAccordingly, Truist estimates the fair value\nof residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS\nvaluation model to project residential MSR\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios, which are then discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The OAS model considers\nportfolio characteristics, contractually-\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment\nassumptions, delinquency rates, late charges,\nother ancillary revenue, costs to service and\nother economic factors. Truist reassesses and\nperiodically adjusts the underlying inputs and\nassumptions in the OAS model to reflect market\nconditions and assumptions that a market\nparticipant would consider in valuing the\nresidential MSR asset.\n\nFair value estimates and assumptions are\ncompared to industry surveys, recent market\nactivity, actual portfolio experience and,\nwhen available, observable market data. Due to\nthe nature of the valuation inputs,\nresidential MSRs are classified within Level 3\nof the valuation hierarchy. The value of\nresidential MSRs is significantly affected by\nmortgage interest rates available in the\nmarketplace, which influence mortgage loan\nprepayment speeds. In general, during periods\nof declining interest rates, the value of MSRs\ndeclines due to increasing prepayments\nattributable to increased mortgage-refinance\nactivity. Conversely, during periods of rising\ninterest rates, the value of residential MSRs\ngenerally increases due to reduced refinance\nactivity. Truist typically hedges against\nmarket value changes in the residential MSRs.\nRefer to \"Note 8. Loan Servicing\" for\nquantitative disclosures reflecting the effect\nthat changes in management's assumptions would\nhave on the fair value of residential MSRs.\n\nLHFS\n\nTruist originates certain residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans for sale to\ninvestors that are measured at fair value. The\nfair value is primarily based on quoted market\nprices for securities backed by similar types\nof loans. Changes in the fair value are\nrecorded as components of Residential mortgage\nincome and Commercial mortgage income, while\nthe related origination costs are generally\nrecognized in Personnel expense when incurred.\nThe changes in fair value are largely driven\nby changes in interest rates subsequent to\nloan funding and changes in the fair value of\nservicing associated with the LHFS. Truist\nuses various derivative instruments to\nmitigate the economic effect of changes in\nfair value of the underlying loans. LHFS also\nincludes certain loans, generally carried at\nLOCOM, where management has committed to a\nformal plan of sale and the loans are\navailable for immediate sale. Adjustments to\nreflect unrealized gains and losses resulting\nfrom changes in fair value, up to the original\ncarrying amount, and realized gains and losses\nupon ultimate sale are classified as\nnoninterest income. The fair value of these\nloans is estimated using observable market\nprices when available. When observable market\nprices are not available, the Company uses\njudgment and estimates fair value using\ninternal models that reflect assumptions\nconsistent with those that would be used by a\nmarket participant in estimating fair value.\nRefer to \"Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" for\nfurther description of the Company\u2019s\naccounting for LHFS.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 77\nTrading Loans\n\nTruist elects to measure certain loans at fair\nvalue for financial reporting where fair value\naligns with the underlying business purpose.\nSpecifically, loans included within this\nclassification include trading loans that are\n(i) purchased in connection with the Company\u2019s\nTRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and\ntrading business within the C&CB segment, or\n(iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to \"Note 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies,\" and \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments,\" for further\ndiscussion of the Company\u2019s TRS business. The\nloans purchased in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS and sales and trading businesses\nare primarily commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans valued based on quoted prices\nfor identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active by a third party\npricing service. SBA loans are fully\nguaranteed by the U.S. government as to\ncontractual principal and interest and there\nis sufficient observable trading activity upon\nwhich to base the estimate of fair value.\n\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nTruist uses derivatives to manage various\nfinancial risks and in a dealer capacity to\nfacilitate client transactions. Truist\nmitigates credit risk by subjecting\ncounterparties to credit reviews and approvals\nsimilar to those used in making loans and\nother extensions of credit. In addition,\ncertain counterparties are required to provide\ncollateral to Truist when their unsecured loss\npositions exceed certain negotiated limits.\nThe fair values of derivative financial\ninstruments are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable data for interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments, which\nare related to mortgage loan commitments, is\nbased on quoted market prices adjusted for\ncommitments that Truist does not expect to\nfund and includes the value attributable to\nthe net servicing fee. Refer to \"Note 19.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\" for further\ninformation on the Company\u2019s derivatives.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nThe acquisition method of accounting requires\nthat assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin business combinations are recorded at their\nfair values. This often involves estimates\nbased on third party valuations or internal\nvaluations based on discounted cash flow\nanalyses or other valuation techniques, which\nare inherently subjective. The amortization of\ndefinite-lived intangible assets is based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits to be\nreceived, which is also subjective. Business\ncombinations also typically result in\ngoodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic\nimpairment tests based on the fair values of\nthe reporting units to which the acquired\ngoodwill relates. Refer to \"Note 1. Basis of\nPresentation\" for a description of the\nimpairment testing process.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Truist\u2019s reporting units\nwith goodwill balances were CB&W, C&CB, and\nIH. Management reviews the goodwill of each\nreporting unit for impairment on an annual\nbasis as of October 1 or more often if events\nor circumstances indicate that it is more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value.\nFor its annual impairment review, Truist\nelected to perform a quantitative test of each\nof its reporting units. The quantitative\nimpairment test estimates the fair value of\nthe reporting units using the income approach\nand market based approaches, weighted 50% and\n50%, respectively. The income approach\nutilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. The\nmarket based approaches utilize comparable\npublic company information, key valuation\nmultiples, and considers a market control\npremium associated with cost synergies and\nother cash flow benefits that arise from\nobtaining control over a reporting unit, and\nguideline transactions, when applicable.\n\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates, applicable\nvaluation multiples based on the comparable\npublic company information, and guideline\ntransaction information. Truist also assesses\nthe reasonableness of the aggregate estimated\nfair value of the reporting units by\ncomparison to its market capitalization over a\nreasonable period of time, including\nconsideration of historic bank control\npremiums and the current market.\n\nMulti-year financial forecasts are developed\nfor each reporting unit by considering several\ninputs and assumptions such as net interest\nmargin, expected credit losses, noninterest\nincome, noninterest expense, and required\ncapital. Of these inputs, the projection of\nnet interest margin is the most significant to\nthe financial projections of the CB&W and C&CB\nreporting units. The long-term growth rate\nused in determining the terminal value of each\nreporting unit was 3% as of October 1, 2021,\nbased on management's assessment of the\nminimum expected terminal growth rate of each\nreporting unit. Discount rates are estimated\nbased on the Capital Asset Pricing Model,\nwhich considers the risk-free interest rate,\nmarket risk premium, beta, and unsystematic\nrisk adjustments specific to a particular\nreporting unit. The discount rates are also\ncalibrated based on risks related to the\nprojected cash flows of each reporting unit.\nThe discount rates utilized for the CB&W,\nC&CB, and IH reporting units as of October 1,\n2021 were 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s annual impairment\nanalysis of goodwill as of October 1, it was\ndetermined for the CB&W, C&CB, and IH\nreporting units that the respective reporting\nunit's fair value was in excess of its\nrespective carrying value as of October 1,\n2021, therefore goodwill is considered not\nimpaired for the CB&W, C&CB, and IH reporting\nunits. None of the reporting units of the\nCompany had a fair value that exceeded the\nrespective carrying value by less than 10%.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company also performs sensitivity analyses\naround these assumptions in order to assess\nthe reasonableness of the assumptions, and the\nresulting estimated fair values. While the\nCompany\u2019s sensitivity analyses did not\nindicate risk of impairment as of October 1.\n2021, future potential changes in these\nassumptions may impact the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit and cause the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit to be below its\ncarrying value. Additionally, a reporting\nunit's carrying value could change based on\nmarket conditions, asset growth, or the risk\nprofile of those reporting units, which could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the fourth quarter of 2021, concluding\nthat it was not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of one or more of its reporting\nunits is below its respective carrying amount\nas of December 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nTruist is subject to income tax laws of the\nU.S., its states, and the municipalities in\nwhich the Company conducts business. In\nestimating the net amount due to or to be\nreceived from tax jurisdictions either\ncurrently or in the future, the Company\nassesses the appropriate tax treatment of\ntransactions and filing positions after\nconsidering statutes, regulations, judicial\nprecedent, and other pertinent information.\nThe income tax laws are complex and subject to\ndifferent interpretations by the taxpayer and\nthe relevant government taxing authorities.\nSignificant judgment is required in\ndetermining the tax accruals and in evaluating\nthe Company\u2019s tax positions, including\nevaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in\nthe estimate of accrued taxes occur\nperiodically due to changes in tax rates,\ninterpretations of tax laws and new judicial\nguidance, the status of examinations by the\ntax authorities, and newly enacted statutory\nand regulatory guidance that could impact the\nrelative merits and risks of tax positions.\nThese changes, when they occur, impact tax\nexpense and can materially affect operating\nresults. Truist reviews tax positions\nquarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new\ninformation becomes available.\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts\navailable to reduce income taxes payable in\nfuture years. Such assets arise due to\ntemporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities, as well as from NOL and tax\ncredit carryforwards. The Company regularly\nevaluates the ability to realize DTAs,\nrecognizing a valuation allowance if, based on\nthe weight of available evidence, it is more-\nlikely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe DTA will not be realized. In determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is necessary,\nthe Company considers the level of taxable\nincome in prior years to the extent that\ncarrybacks are permitted under current tax\nlaws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax\nand taxable income and tax planning strategies\nthat would, if necessary, be implemented.\nTruist currently maintains a valuation\nallowance for certain state carryforwards. For\nadditional income tax information, refer to\n\"Note 1. Basis of Presentation\" and \"Note 14.\nIncome Taxes.\"\n                                              \n  Pension and Postretirement Benefit          \n  Obligations                                 \n                                              \nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions,\nwhich are subject to management judgment and\nmay differ significantly if different\nassumptions are used. The discount rate\nassumption used to measure the postretirement\nbenefit obligations is set by reference to an\nAA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and\nthe individual characteristics of the plans\nsuch as projected cash flow patterns and\npayment durations.\n\nManagement also considered the sensitivity\nthat changes in the expected return on plan\nassets and the discount rate would have on\npension expense. For the Company\u2019s qualified\nplans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the\ndiscount rate would result in additional\npension expense of approximately $23 million\nfor 2022, while a decrease of 100 basis points\nin the expected return on plan assets would\nresult in an increase of approximately $166\nmillion in pension expense for 2022.

We also have audited the\nCompany's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021 based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2021 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.

Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial\nstatements included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, and testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing such other procedures\nas we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\n\n80 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matter communicated below\nis a matter arising from the current period\naudit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter\nor on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Certain\nCommercial and Consumer Portfolios\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit losses (ACL)\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe consolidated ACL balance was $4.7 billion\nas of December 31, 2021, including $1.8\nbillion for commercial portfolios and $2.3\nbillion for consumer portfolios. Estimates of\nexpected future credit losses are determined\nby management using quantitative models and by\napplying qualitative adjustments to the\nmodeled results. The models are designed to\nforecast probability of default, exposure at\ndefault, and loss given default by correlating\ncertain macroeconomic forecast data to\nhistorical experience. The models are applied\nto pools of loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The macroeconomic forecast\ndata used in the quantitative models is based\non forecasted variables for a reasonable and\nsupportable period. The qualitative\nadjustments incorporate management judgment\nand are used to account for limitations in\nmodeled results related to current economic\nconditions and other risks in the portfolios.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the ACL for certain commercial and\nconsumer portfolios is a critical audit matter\nare (i) the significant judgment by management\nin determining the ACL quantitative model\nresults and certain qualitative adjustments,\n(ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence\nrelated to the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, and (iii) the\naudit effort involved the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness\nof controls relating to the Company\u2019s ACL\nestimation process for certain commercial and\nconsumer portfolios, which included controls\nrelated to the quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments. These\nprocedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for determining\nthe ACL for certain commercial and consumer\nportfolios quantitative model results and\ncertain qualitative adjustments, including\nevaluating the appropriateness of the\nquantitative models and management\u2019s\nmethodology, testing the data used in the\nestimate, and evaluating the reasonableness of\njudgments used by management in estimating\ncertain qualitative adjustments. Professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge were used\nto assist in evaluating the appropriateness of\nthese quantitative models and the\nreasonableness of judgments used by management\nrelating to certain qualitative adjustments.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor

Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 1. Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nTruist Financial Corporation is a purpose-\ndriven financial services company committed to\ninspiring and building better lives and\ncommunities. Formed by the historic merger of\nequals of BB&T and SunTrust, Truist has\nleading market share in many high-growth\nmarkets in the country. The Company offers a\nwide range of services including retail, small\nbusiness and commercial banking; asset\nmanagement; capital markets; commercial real\nestate; corporate and institutional banking;\ninsurance; mortgage; payments; specialized\nlending; and wealth management. Headquartered\nin Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist is a top\n10 U.S. commercial bank. The Company operates\nand measures business activity across three\nbusiness segments: Consumer Banking and\nWealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and\nInsurance Holdings. For additional information\non the Company\u2019s business segments, see \u201cNote\n21. Operating Segments.\u201d\n\nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. The accounting and reporting policies\nare in accordance with GAAP. Additionally,\nwhere applicable, the policies conform to the\naccounting and reporting guidelines prescribed\nby regulatory authorities. The following is a\nsummary of significant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Truist Financial Corporation\nand those subsidiaries that are wholly or\nmajority owned by Truist or over which Truist\nhas a controlling financial interest.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are\neliminated in consolidation. The results of\noperations of companies and net assets\nacquired are included from the date of\nacquisition. Results of operations associated\nwith entities or net assets sold are included\nthrough the date of disposition.\nTruist holds investments in certain legal\nentities that are considered VIEs. VIEs are\nlegal entities in which equity investors do\nnot have sufficient equity at risk for the\nentity to independently finance its\nactivities, or as a group, the holders of the\nequity investment at risk lack the power\nthrough voting or similar rights to direct the\nactivities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance,\nor do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the entity or the right to\nreceive expected residual returns of the\nentity. Consolidation of a VIE is required if\na reporting entity is the primary beneficiary\nof the VIE.\nInvestments in VIEs are evaluated to determine\nif Truist is the primary beneficiary. This\nevaluation gives appropriate consideration to\nthe design of the entity and the variability\nthat the entity was designed to create and\npass along, the relative power of each party,\nand to Truist\u2019s obligation to absorb losses or\nreceive residual returns of the entity. Truist\nhas variable interests in certain entities\nthat are not required to be consolidated,\nincluding affordable housing and other\npartnership interests. Refer to \"Note 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies\" for additional\ndisclosures regarding Truist\u2019s VIEs.\nInvestments in entities for which the Company\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not control, over operating and\nfinancing decisions are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in Other assets in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost,\nadjusted to reflect the Company\u2019s portion of\nincome, loss, or dividends of the investee.\nTruist records its portion of income or loss\nin Other noninterest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. These\ninvestments are periodically evaluated for\nimpairment.\nThe Company reports any noncontrolling\ninterests in its subsidiaries in the equity\nsection of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nseparately presents the income or loss\nattributable to the noncontrolling interest of\na consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nReclassifications\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company\nreclassified the lease financing portfolio to\nthe commercial and industrial portfolio.\nAdditionally the Company reclassified certain\nstructured real estate activity from\ncommercial mortgage income to investment\nbanking and trading income and certain LIHTC\nactivity from commercial mortgage income to\nother income. Prior periods were reclassified\nto conform to the current presentation.\nCertain other amounts reported in prior\nperiods' consolidated financial statements\nhave been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent presentation.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 87\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of\nFinancial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nBusiness Combinations\nTruist accounts for business combinations\nusing the acquisition method. The accounts of\nan acquired entity are included as of the date\nof acquisition, and any excess of purchase\nprice over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is capitalized as goodwill.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash and\ndue from banks and interest-bearing deposits\nwith banks that have original maturities of\nthree months or less. Accordingly, the\ncarrying amount of such instruments is\nconsidered a reasonable estimate of fair\nvalue. Restricted cash was immaterial at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nSecurities Financing Activities\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell are accounted for as\ncollateralized financing transactions and are\nrecorded at the amounts at which the\nsecurities were borrowed or purchased. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and related counterparty agree on the\namount of collateral required to secure the\nprincipal amount loaned under these\nagreements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements.\nShort-term borrowings includes securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, which are\naccounted for as collateralized financing\ntransactions and are recorded at the amounts\nat which the securities were sold within\nShort-term borrowings. The Company monitors\ncollateral values daily and pledges collateral\nas warranted under the respective agreements.\nTrading Activities\nVarious trading assets and liabilities are\nused to accommodate the investment and risk\nmanagement activities of the Company\u2019s\nclients. Product offerings to clients include\ndebt securities, loans traded in the secondary\nmarket, equity securities, derivative\ncontracts, and other similar financial\ninstruments. The Company elects to apply fair\nvalue accounting to trading loans. Trading\nloans include: (i) loans held in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s trading business primarily\nconsisting of commercial and corporate\nleveraged loans; (ii) certain SBA loans\nguaranteed by the U.S. government; and (iii)\nloans made or acquired in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s TRS business. Other trading-related\nactivities include acting as a market maker\nfor certain debt and equity security\ntransactions, derivative instrument\ntransactions, and foreign exchange\ntransactions. Trading assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recognized within Noninterest\nincome in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Interest income on\ntrading account securities is included in\nInterest on other earning assets. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\ntrading activities, see \"Note 16. Commitments\nand Contingencies\" and \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company invests in various debt securities\nprimarily for liquidity management purposes\nand as part of the overall ALM process to\noptimize income and market performance.\nInvestments in debt securities that are not\nheld for trading purposes are classified as\nHTM or AFS.\nInterest income on securities is recognized in\nincome on an accrual basis. Premiums and\ndiscounts are amortized into interest income\nusing the effective interest method over the\ncontractual life of the security. As\nprepayments are received, a proportionate\namount of the related premium or discount is\nrecognized in income so that the effective\ninterest rate on the remaining portion of the\nsecurity continues unchanged.\nDebt securities are classified as HTM when\nTruist has both the intent and ability to hold\nthe securities to maturity. HTM securities are\nreported at amortized cost. AFS securities are\nreported at estimated fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI,\nnet of deferred income taxes, in the\nShareholders' equity section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses\nrealized from the sale of AFS securities are\ndetermined by specific identification and are\nincluded in noninterest income.\n88 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nAn unrealized loss exists when the current\nfair value of an individual security is less\nthan its amortized cost basis. AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nevaluated at the balance sheet date to\ndetermine whether such losses are credit-\nrelated. Credit losses are measured on an\nindividual basis and recognized in an ACL.\nChanges in expected credit losses are\nrecognized in the Provision for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMunicipal securities are evaluated for\nimpairment using a municipal bond credit\nscoring tool that leverages historical\nmunicipal market data to estimate probability\nof default and loss given default at the\nissuer level. U.S. Treasury securities,\ngovernment guaranteed securities, and other\nsecurities issued by GSEs are either\nexplicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the US\ngovernment, are highly rated by rating\nagencies and have a long history of no credit\nlosses. Non-agency MBS in the portfolio\nreflect recent issuances that are highly\nrated, include excess collateral and are\ncollateralized by loans to borrowers with high\ncredit scores and low loan to value ratios.\nTruist utilizes cash flow modeling for the\nevaluation of potential credit impairment on\nnon-agency securities in an unrealized loss\nposition. Cash flow modeling incorporates a\nvariety of factors that impact the long term\nexpectation of collateral performance.\nImpairment is attributable to factors other\nthan credit when there continues to be an\nexpectation of the collection of all\ncontractual principal and interest. There was\nnoACL on the Company\u2019s AFS debt securities at\nDecember 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, HTM\ndebt securities consists of government\nguaranteed securities for which noloss is\nexpected.\n\nPrior to the adoption of CECL on January 1,\n2020, investment securities in an unrealized\nloss position were evaluated quarterly for\nOTTI. Truist considered such factors as the\nlength of time and the extent to which the\nfair value was below amortized cost, long term\nexpectations and recent experience regarding\nprincipal and interest payments, Truist\u2019s\nintent to sell and whether it was more-likely-\nthan-not that the Company would be required to\nsell those securities before the anticipated\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis. The\ncredit component of an OTTI loss was\nrecognized in earnings and the non-credit\ncomponent was recognized in AOCI, net of tax,\nin situations where Truist did not intend to\nsell the security and it was more-likely-than-\nnot that Truist would have been required to\nsell the security prior to recovery.\nSubsequent to recognition of OTTI, an increase\nin expected cash flows was recognized as a\nyield adjustment over the remaining expected\nlife of the security based on an evaluation of\nthe nature of the increase.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities that are not classified as\ntrading assets or liabilities are recorded in\nOther assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered\nmarketable and measured at fair value, with\nchanges in the fair value recognized as a\ncomponent of Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMarketable equity securities include mutual\nfund investments and other publicly traded\nequity securities. Dividends received from\nmarketable equity securities and FHLB stock\nare recognized within Interest income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity\nsecurities that are not accounted for under\nthe equity method and that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values are considered non-\nmarketable and are accounted for at cost minus\nimpairment, if any, plus or minus changes\nresulting from observable price changes in\norderly transactions for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same issuer. Any\nadjustments to the carrying value of these\nnon-marketable equity securities are\nrecognized in Other noninterest income in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNon-marketable equity securities include FHLB\nstock and other equity investments. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities, see \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nLHFS\nLHFS includes primarily residential mortgage\nand commercial mortgage loans that management\nintends to sell in the secondary market and\nother loans that management has an active plan\nto sell. LHFS also includes specifically\nidentified loans where management has\ncommitted to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale.\nThe Company elects to apply fair value\naccounting to residential and commercial\nmortgage loans that are originated with the\nintent to be sold in the secondary market.\nDirect loan origination fees associated with\nthese loans are recorded as Residential\nmortgage and Commercial mortgage income. The\nmajority of direct origination costs are\nrecorded in Personnel expense. The fair value\nof these loans is derived from observable\ncurrent market prices when available and\nincludes loan servicing value. When observable\nmarket prices are not available, the Company\nuses judgment and estimates fair value using\ninternal models that reflect assumptions\nconsistent with those that would be used by a\nmarket participant in estimating fair value.\nFirst lien residential mortgage LHFS are\ntransferred in conjunction with GNMA and GSE\nsecuritization transactions, whereby the loans\nare exchanged for cash or securities that are\nreadily redeemable for cash with servicing\nrights retained. Net gains/losses on the sale\nof residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at\ninception of the associated interest rate lock\ncommitments and reflect the change in value of\nthe loans resulting from changes in interest\nrates from the time the Company enters into\ninterest rate lock commitments with borrowers\nuntil the loans are sold, adjusted for pull\nthrough rates and excluding hedge transactions\ninitiated to mitigate this market risk.\nCommercial mortgage LHFS are sold to FNMA and\nFHLMC and the Company also issues and sells\nGNMA commercial MBS backed by FHA insured\nloans. The loans and securities are exchanged\nfor cash with servicing rights retained. Gains\nand losses on sales of residential, commercial\nmortgage, and other consumer loans are\nincluded in Residential mortgage income,\nCommercial mortgage income, and Other income,\nrespectively.\nOther consumer loans are typically sold to\nunrelated third parties shortly after\norigination and are immaterial as of December\n31, 2021.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 89\nSpecifically identified LHFS, where management\nhas committed to a formal plan of sale and the\nloans are available for immediate sale, are\ngenerally recorded at LOCOM. Origination fees\nand costs for such loans are capitalized in\nthe basis of the loan and are included in the\ncalculation of realized gains and losses upon\nsale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized losses\nresulting from changes in fair value and\nrealized gains and losses upon ultimate sale\nof the loans are classified as Noninterest\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The fair value of these loans is\nestimated using observable market prices when\navailable, but may also incorporate\nconsideration of other unobservable inputs\nsuch as indicative bids, broker price opinions\nor other information derived from internal or\nexternal data sources.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may\ntransfer certain loans from HFI to LHFS. At\nthe time of transfer, any credit losses are\nsubject to charge-off in accordance with the\nCompany\u2019s policy and are recorded as a\nreduction in the ALLL. Any additional losses,\nincluding those related to interest rate or\nliquidity-related valuation adjustments are\nrecorded as a component of Noninterest income\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s LHFS,\nsee \"Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures.\"\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company\u2019s accounting methods for loans\ndiffer depending on whether the loans are\noriginated or purchased, and if purchased,\nwhether or not the loans reflect credit\ndeterioration since the date of origination\nsuch that at the date of acquisition there is\nmore than an insignificant deterioration in\ncredit.\nUnearned income, discounts, and net deferred\nloan fees and costs includes direct costs\nassociated with loan origination as well as\npremiums and discounts from origination or\npurchase, which are deferred and amortized\nover the respective loan terms.\nOriginated Loans and Leases\nLoans and leases that management has the\nintent and ability to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture or until maturity or payoff are\nreported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unearned income, charge-\noffs, and unamortized fees and costs. Interest\nand fees on loans and leases includes certain\nloan fees and deferred direct costs associated\nwith the lending process recognized over the\ncontractual lives of the loans using the\neffective interest for amortizing loans or\nstraight-line method for loans with interest-\nonly repayment terms or revolving privileges.\nPurchased Loans\nPurchased loans are recorded at their fair\nvalue at the acquisition date. Purchased loans\nare evaluated upon acquisition and classified\nas either PCD, which indicates that the loan\nreflects more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination, or non-\nPCD. Truist considers a variety of factors in\nconnection with the identification of more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality, including but not limited to risk\ngrades, delinquency, nonperforming status,\nprevious troubled debt restructurings,\nbankruptcies, and other qualitative factors\nthat indicate deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination.\nFair values for purchased loans in a business\ncombination are based on a discounted cash\nflow methodology that considers credit loss\nexpectations, market interest, rates, and\nother market factors such as liquidity from\nthe perspective of a market participant. Loans\nare grouped together according to similar\ncharacteristics and treated in the aggregate\nwhen applying various valuation techniques.\nThe probability of default, loss given default\nand prepayment assumptions are the key factors\ndriving credit losses which are embedded into\nthe estimated cash flows. These assumptions\nare informed by comparable internal data on\nloan characteristics, historical loss\nexperience, and current and forecasted\neconomic conditions. The interest and\nliquidity component of the estimate are\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof the underlying loans. The discount rates\nused for loans are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans\nand include adjustments for liquidity. The\ndiscount rates do not include a factor for\ncredit losses as that has been included as a\nreduction to the estimated cash flows.\nFor PCD loans, the initial estimate of\nexpected credit losses is determined using the\nsame methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment and recognized as an adjustment to\nthe acquisition price of the asset; thus, the\nsum of the loans\u2019 purchase price and initial\nALLL estimate represents the initial amortized\ncost basis. The difference between the initial\namortized cost basis and the par value is the\nnon-credit discount or premium. For non-PCD\nloans, the difference between the fair value\nand the par value is considered the fair value\nmark. The initial ALLL for non-PCD loans is\nrecorded with a corresponding charge to the\nProvision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent\nchanges in the ALLL related to PCD and non-PCD\nloans are recognized in the Provision for\ncredit losses.\n90 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe non-credit discount or premium related to\nPCD loans and the fair value mark on non-PCD\nloans are amortized or accreted to Interest\nand fees on loans and leases over the\ncontractual life of the loans using the\neffective interest method for amortizing\nloans, and using a straight-line approach for\nloans with interest-only repayment terms or\nrevolving privileges. In the event of\nprepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums\nare recognized in Interest and fees on loans\nand leases.\nTDRs\nModifications to a borrower's debt agreement\nare considered TDRs if a concession is granted\nfor economic or legal reasons related to a\nborrower's financial difficulties that\notherwise would not be considered. TDRs are\nundertaken to improve the likelihood of\nrecovery on the loan and may take the form of\nmodifications that result in the stated\ninterest rate of the loan being lower than the\ncurrent market rate for new debt with similar\nrisk, other modifications to the structure of\nthe loan that fall outside of normal\nunderwriting policies and procedures, or in\ncertain limited circumstances, forgiveness of\nprincipal or interest. A restructuring that\nresults in only a delay in payments that is\ninsignificant is not considered an economic\nconcession. For loan modification programs in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, Truist\napplied the relief from TDR accounting\ndescribed in the CARES Act. Payment relief\nassistance provided by Truist includes\nforbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-\naging programs, along with certain other\nmodification strategies.\nTDRs can be classified as performing or\nnonperforming, depending on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of the borrower and an\nevaluation as to whether the borrower will be\nable to repay the loan based on the modified\nterms. In circumstances where the TDR involves\ncharging off a portion of the loan balance,\nTruist classifies these TDRs as nonperforming.\nThe decision to maintain a commercial TDR on\nperforming status is based on a current, well\ndocumented credit evaluation of the borrower's\nfinancial condition and prospects for\nrepayment under the modified terms. This\nevaluation includes consideration of the\nborrower's current capacity to pay, which\namong other things may include a review of the\nborrower's current financial statements, an\nanalysis of cash flow available to pay debt\nobligations, and an evaluation of secondary\nsources of payment from the borrower and any\nguarantors. This evaluation also includes an\nevaluation of the borrower's current\nwillingness to pay, which may include a review\nof past payment history, an evaluation of the\nborrower's willingness to provide information\non a timely basis, and consideration of offers\nfrom the borrower to provide additional\ncollateral or guarantor support. The credit\nevaluation may also include review of cash\nflow projections, consideration of the\nadequacy of collateral to cover all principal\nand interest and trends indicating improving\nprofitability and collectability of\nreceivables.\nThe evaluation of mortgage and other consumer\nloans includes an evaluation of the client's\ndebt-to-income ratio, credit report, property\nvalue and certain other client-specific\nfactors that impact the clients\u2019 ability to\nmake timely principal and interest payments on\nthe loan.\nNPAs\nNPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property.\nForeclosed property consists of real estate\nand other assets acquired as a result of\nclients' loan defaults. Truist\u2019s policies for\nplacing loans on nonperforming status conform\nto guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory\nauthorities. Truist classifies loans and\nleases as past due when the payment of\nprincipal and interest based upon contractual\nterms is greater than 30days delinquent or if\none payment is past due. Payment deferrals\ngranted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\ndo not result in a loan becoming past due. The\nfollowing table summarizes the delinquency\nthresholds that are a factor used in\nevaluating nonperforming classification and\nthe timing of charge-off evaluations:\n                                              \n       P\u2026                   E\u2026                \n  \u2026    on                   f\u2026                \n  \u2026    N\u2026                   C\u2026                \n  \u2026    (\u2026                   (\u2026                \n       (\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026        90    -3             \u2026    -3       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90                   \u2026             \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        90    to    \u2026        \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        NA                   \u2026    to    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n(1) Loans may be returned to performing status\nwhen (i) the borrower has resumed paying the\nfull amount of the scheduled contractual\ninterest and principal payments, (ii)\nmanagement concludes that all principal and\ninterest amounts contractually due (including\narrearages) are reasonably assured of\nrepayment, and (iii) there is a sustained\nperiod of repayment performance, generally a\nminimum of six months.\n(2) The timing of nonaccrual and charge-off\nevaluations are accelerated in circumstances\nwhere the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.\n(3) Or when it is probable that principal or\ninterest is not fully collectible, whichever\noccurs first.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 91\n(4) Depends on product type, loss mitigation\nstatus, status of the government guaranty, if\napplicable, and certain other product-specific\nfactors.\n\n(5) Student loans are not placed in\nnonperforming status, which reflects\nconsideration of governmental guarantees or\naccelerated charge-off policies related to\ncertain non-guaranteed portfolios.\n\n(6) Government guaranteed loans are considered\nto be in default once they reach 270 days past\ndue and claims are generally filed once the\nloans reaches 365 days past due. The non-\nguaranteed balance, which ranges from 2-3%, is\ncharged off once the claim proceeds related to\nthe guaranteed portion have been received,\nwhich typically occurs no later than 365 days\npast due.\n\n(7) Credit cards are generally not placed on\nnonperforming status, but are fully charged\noff at specified delinquency dates consistent\nwith regulatory guidelines.\n\nWhen commercial loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, management evaluates\nwhether a charge-off must be recorded. For\ncollateral-dependent loans, this evaluation is\nbased on a comparison of the loan\u2019s carrying\nvalue to the value of the related collateral,\nwhile for non-collateral dependent loans, this\nevaluation reflects management\u2019s conclusions\nwith regard to whether any portion of the loan\nis considered uncollectible. Consumer and\ncredit card loans are subject to charge-off at\na specified delinquency date consistent with\nregulatory guidelines.\n\nCertain past due loans may remain on\nperforming status if management determines\nthat it does not have concern over the\ncollectability of principal and interest.\nGenerally, when loans are placed on\nnonperforming status, accrued interest\nreceivable is reversed against interest income\nin the current period and amortization of\ndeferred loan fees and expenses for originated\nloans, and fair value marks for purchased\nloans, is suspended. For commercial loans and\ncertain consumer loans, payments received for\ninterest and lending fees thereafter are\napplied as a reduction to the remaining\nprincipal balance as long as concern exists as\nto the ultimate collection of the principal.\nInterest income on nonperforming loans is\nrecognized after the principal has been\nreduced to zero. If and when borrowers\ndemonstrate the ability to repay a loan\nclassified as nonperforming in accordance with\nits contractual terms, the loan may be\nreturned to performing status upon meeting all\nregulatory, accounting and internal policy\nrequirements.\n\nAccrued interest is included in Other assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued\ninterest receivable balances are not\nconsidered in connection with the ACL\nestimation process, as such amounts are\ngenerally reversed against interest income\nwhen the loan is placed in nonperforming\nstatus.\n\nAssets acquired as a result of foreclosure are\ninitially recorded at fair value less\nestimated cost to sell and subsequently\ncarried at LOCOM. Net realizable value equals\nfair value less estimated selling costs. Any\nexcess of cost over net realizable value at\nthe time of foreclosure is charged to the\nALLL. NPAs are subject to periodic\nrevaluations of the collateral underlying\nimpaired loans and foreclosed real estate. The\nperiodic revaluations are generally based on\nthe appraised value of the property and may\ninclude additional liquidity adjustments based\nupon the expected retention period. Truist\u2019s\npolicies require that valuations be updated at\nleast annually and that upon foreclosure, the\nvaluation must not be more than six monthsold,\notherwise an update is required. Any\nsubsequent changes in value as well as gains\nor losses from the disposition of these assets\nare recognized in Other noninterest expense in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s loan\nand lease activities, see \"Note 5. Loans and\nACL.\"\nACL\nThe ACL includes the ALLL and RUFC. The ACL\nrepresents management's best estimate of\nexpected future credit losses related to loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe ALLL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from or added to the loans\u2019 amortized\ncost basis to present the net amount expected\nto be collected on loans. The entire amount of\nthe ACL is available to absorb losses on any\nloan category or lending-related commitment.\nLoan or lease balances deemed to be\nuncollectible are charged off against the\nALLL. Expected recoveries of amounts\npreviously charged off are incorporated into\nthe ALLL estimate, with such amounts capped at\nthe aggregate of amounts previously charged\noff. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to\nthe Provision for credit losses, which is\nreflected in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. The RUFC is recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\n92 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPortfolio segments represent the level at\nwhich Truist develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine its ACL.\nTruist\u2019s loan and lease portfolio consists of\nthree portfolio segments: commercial,\nconsumer, and credit card. The expected credit\nloss models are generally developed one level\nbelow the portfolio segment level. In certain\ninstances, loans and leases are further\ndisaggregated by similar risk characteristics,\nsuch as business sector, client type, funding\ntype, type of collateral, whether loan\npayments are interest-only, and whether\ninterest rates are fixed or variable. Larger\nloans and leases that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics or that are considered\ncollateral-dependent are individually\nevaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is\ndetermined through review of data specific to\nthe borrower and related collateral, if any.\nSuch estimates may be based on current loss\nforecasts, an evaluation of the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral or in certain\ncircumstances the present value of expected\ncash flows discounted at the loan's effective\ninterest as described further below. The\ncommercial portfolio segment models use a risk\nrating approach to estimate the ALLL. Truist\nmay also consider specific environmental,\nsocial, and governance considerations in the\nrisk rating methodology for commercial loans.\nThe consumer and credit card models use a\ndelinquency-based approach to estimate the\nALLL. In addition to these quantitatively\ncalculated components, the ALLL includes\nqualitatively calculated components.\n\nTruist maintains a collectively calculated\nALLL for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collectively calculated\nALLL is estimated using relevant available\ninformation from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTruist maintains quantitative models to\nforecast expected credit losses. The credit\nloss forecasting models use portfolio\nbalances, macroeconomic forecast data,\nportfolio composition and loan attributes as\nthe primary inputs. Loss estimates are\ninformed by historical loss experience\nadjusted for macroeconomic forecast data and\ncurrent and expected portfolio risk\ncharacteristics. Expected losses are estimated\nthrough contractual maturity unless the\nborrower has a right to renew that is not\ncancellable or it is reasonably expected that\nthe loan will be modified as a TDR.\n\nThe Scenario Committee provides guidance,\nselection, and approval for enterprise-\nsanctioned macroeconomic forecast data,\nincluding the macroeconomic forecast data for\nuse in the ACL process. Forecasted economic\nconditions are developed using third party\nmacroeconomic forecast data across scenarios\nadjusted based on management\u2019s expectations\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years. Assumptions revert to\nlong term historic averages gradually over a\none year period. Macroeconomic forecast data\nused in estimating the expected losses vary by\nloan portfolio and include employment factors,\nestimated collateral values, and market\nindicators as described by portfolio segment\nbelow.\n\nA qualitative allowance which incorporates\nmanagement\u2019s judgement is also included in the\nestimation of expected future loan and lease\nlosses, including qualitative adjustments in\ncircumstances where the model output is\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations\nwith respect to expected credit losses. This\nallowance is used to adjust for limitations in\nmodeled results related to the current\neconomic conditions, and considerations with\nrespect to the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.\n\nThe methodology for determining the RUFC is\ninherently similar to that used to determine\nthe funded component of the ALLL and is\nmeasured over the period there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit that\nis not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC\nis adjusted for factors specific to binding\ncommitments, including the probability of\nfunding and exposure at default.\n\nThe ACL is monitored by the ACL Committee. The\nACL Committee approves the ACL estimate and\nmay recommend adjustments where necessary\nbased on portfolio performance and other items\nthat may impact credit risk.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Truist adopted the CECL\naccounting standard, which changed the manner\nin which it accounts for the allowance for\ncredit losses. Prior to the adoption of CECL,\nthe ACL represented management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable credit losses incurred in the loan\nand lease portfolios and off-balance sheet\nlending commitments at the balance sheet date.\nThe estimation of the ACL prior to the\nadoption did not consider reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts that could have affected\nthe collectability of the reported amounts.\n\nThe following provides a description of\naccounting policies, methodologies, and credit\nquality indicators related to each of the\nportfolio segments:\n               Truist Financial Corporation 93\nCommercial\n\nThe majority of loans in the commercial\nlending portfolio are assigned risk ratings\nbased on an assessment of conditions that\naffect the borrower's ability to meet\ncontractual obligations under the loan\nagreement. This process includes reviewing\nborrowers' financial information, historical\npayment experience, credit documentation,\npublic information, and other information\nspecific to each borrower. Risk ratings are\nreviewed on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently for many relationships based on the\npolicy requirements regarding various risk\ncharacteristics. While this review is largely\nfocused on the borrower's ability to repay the\nloan, Truist also considers the capacity and\nwillingness of a loan's guarantors to support\nthe loan as a secondary source of repayment.\nWhen a guarantor exhibits the documented\ncapacity and willingness to support the loan,\nTruist may consider extending the loan\nmaturity and/or temporarily deferring\nprincipal payments if the ultimate collection\nof both principal and interest is reasonably\nassured. In these cases, Truist may determine\nthe loan is not impaired due to the documented\ncapacity and willingness of the guarantor to\nrepay the loan. Loans are considered impaired\nwhen the borrower (or guarantor in certain\ncircumstances) does not have the cash flow\ncapacity or willingness to service the debt\naccording to contractual terms, or it does not\nappear reasonable to assume that the borrower\nwill continue to pay according to the\ncontractual agreement. The following table\nsummarizes risk ratings that Truist uses to\nmonitor credit quality in its commercial\nportfolio:\n                                              \n  Risk Rating        Description              \n  Pass               Loans not considered to  \n                     be problem credits       \n                     Loans that have a        \n  Special Mention    potential weakness       \n                     deserving management's   \n                     close attention          \n                     Loans for which a        \n                     well-defined weakness    \n                     has been identified      \n  Substandard        that may put full        \n                     collection of            \n                     contractual cash flows   \n                     at risk                  \n                     Loans for which full     \n  Nonperforming      collection of principal  \n                     and interest is not      \n                     considered probable      \n                                              \nLoans are generally pooled one level below the\nportfolio segment for the collectively\ncalculated ALLL based on factors such as\nbusiness sector, project and property type,\nline of business, collateral, loan type,\nobligor exposure, and risk grade or score.\nCommercial loss forecasting models are\nexpected loss frameworks that use\nmacroeconomic forecast data across scenarios\nand current portfolio attributes as inputs.\nThe models forecast probability of default,\nexposure at default and loss given default by\ncorrelating certain macroeconomic forecast\ndata to historical experience. The primary\nmacroeconomic drivers for the commercial\nportfolios include unemployment trends, U.S.\nreal GDP, corporate credit spreads, rental\nrates, and property values.\n\nTruist\u2019s policy is to review and individually\nevaluate the reserve for all nonperforming\nlending relationships and TDRs with an\noutstanding balance of $ 5million or more, as\nsuch lending relationships do not typically\nshare similar risk characteristics with\nothers. Individually evaluated reserves are\nbased on current forecasts, the present value\nof expected cash flows discounted at the\nloan's effective interest rate, or the value\nof collateral, which is generally based on\nappraisals, recent sales of foreclosed\nproperties and/or relevant property-specific\nmarket information. Truist has elected to\nmeasure expected credit losses on collateral-\ndependent loans based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Loans are considered collateral\ndependent when it is probable that Truist will\nbe unable to collect principal and interest\naccording to the contractual terms of the\nagreement and repayment is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\ncontinued operation of the underlying\ncollateral. Commercial loans are typically\nsecured by real estate, business equipment,\ninventories, and other types of collateral.\n\nConsumer and Credit Card\n\nThe majority of the ALLL related to the\nconsumer and credit card lending portfolios is\ncalculated on a collective basis. Loans are\npooled one level below the portfolio segment\nfor the collectively calculated ALLL based on\nfactors such as collateral, loan type, line of\nbusiness, and sales channel. Consumer\nportfolio models are expected loss frameworks\nthat use macroeconomic forecast data across\nscenarios and current portfolio attributes as\ninputs. The models forecast probability of\ndefault, exposure at default and loss given\ndefault by correlating certain macroeconomic\nforecast data to historical experience. The\nprimary macroeconomic drivers for the consumer\nportfolios include unemployment trends, the\nprimary 30-year mortgage rate, home price\nindices, and used car prices.\n\nResidential mortgages and revolving home\nequity lines of credit are generally\ncollateralized by one-to-four-family\nresidential real estate, typically have loan-\nto-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at\norigination, and are made to borrowers in good\ncredit standing. The indirect auto and\nindirect other portfolios include secured\nindirect installment loans to consumers for\nthe purchase of new and used automobiles,\nboats and recreational vehicles. The student\nloan portfolio is composed of government\nguaranteed student loans and certain private\nstudent loans. The government guarantee\nmitigates substantially all of the risk\nrelated to principal and interest repayment\nfor this component of the portfolio. Private\nstudent loans were originated with a credit\nenhancement from a third-party which partially\nmitigates the Company\u2019s credit exposure.\nDuring 2020, the Company discontinued new\norigination of private student loans. The\ncredit card portfolio and other arrangements\nwithin the indirect other and residential home\nequity and direct portfolios are generally\nunsecured and are actively managed.\n\nTruist uses delinquency status to monitor\ncredit quality in its consumer and credit card\nportfolios. Delinquency status is the primary\nfactor considered in determining whether a\nloan should be classified as nonperforming.\n\nThe ALLL for loans classified as a TDR is\nbased on analyses capturing the expected\ncredit losses and the impact of the concession\nover the remaining life of the asset.\n\n94 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nExpected recoveries for loans are included in\nthe estimation of the ALLL based on historical\nexperience.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises, equipment, finance leases, and\nleasehold improvements are stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed\nprimarily using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the related\nassets and is recorded within the\ncorresponding Noninterest expense categories\non the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the\nimprovements\u2019 estimated useful lives or the\nlease term. An impairment loss on a long-lived\nasset or asset group, including premises and\nequipment and a ROU asset, is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of a long-\nlived asset exceeds its fair value.\nLessee operating and finance leases\nTruist has operating and finance leases for\ndata centers, corporate offices, branches,\nretail centers, and certain equipment.\nOperating leases with an original lease term\nin excess of one year are included in Other\nassets and Other liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases\nare included in Premises and equipment and\nLong-term debt in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating and finance lease assets and\nliabilities are recognized at the commencement\ndate based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term. Operating lease\ncosts are recorded in Net occupancy expense or\nEquipment expense based on the underlying\nasset. Truist uses an implicit interest rate\nin determining the present value of lease\npayments when readily determinable, and a\ncollateralized incremental borrowing rate when\nan implicit rate is not available. Lease terms\nconsider options to extend or terminate based\non the determination of whether such renewal\nor termination options are deemed reasonably\ncertain.\nLease agreements that contain non-lease\ncomponents are generally accounted for as a\nsingle lease component. Variable costs, such\nas maintenance expenses, property and sales\ntaxes, association dues and index based rate\nincreases, are expensed as they are incurred.\nThe impairment policy for a ROU asset is\ndiscussed within the Premises and Equipment\nsection above.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nLife insurance policies on certain current and\nformer directors, officers and teammates, for\nwhich Truist is the owner and beneficiary are\nstated at the cash surrender value within\nOther assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Changes in cash surrender value and\nproceeds from insurance benefits are recorded\nin Income from bank-owned life insurance in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s provision for income taxes is\nbased on income and expense reported for\nfinancial statement purposes after adjustments\nfor permanent differences such as interest\nincome from lending to tax-exempt entities,\ntax credits, and amortization expense related\nto qualified affordable housing investments.\nIn computing the provision for income taxes,\nthe Company evaluates the technical merits of\nits income tax positions based on current\nlegislative, judicial, and regulatory\nguidance. The deferral method of accounting is\nused on investments that generate investment\ntax credits, such that the investment tax\ncredits are recognized as a reduction to the\nrelated investment. Additionally, the Company\nrecognizes all excess tax benefits and\ndeficiencies on employee share-based payments\nas a component of the Provision for income\ntaxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. These tax effects, generally\ndetermined upon the exercise of stock options\nor vesting of restricted stock, are treated as\ndiscrete items in the period in which they\noccur. The provision for income taxes does not\nreflect the tax effects of unrealized gains\nand losses and other income and expenses\nrecorded in AOCI. For additional information\nrelated to the Company\u2019s unrealized gains and\nlosses, see \"Note 13. AOCI.\"\nDTAs and DTLs result from differences between\nthe timing of the recognition of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes\nand for income tax purposes. These deferred\nassets and liabilities are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected\nto apply in the periods in which the DTAs or\nDTLs are expected to be realized. Subsequent\nchanges in the tax laws require adjustment to\nthese deferred assets and liabilities with the\ncumulative effect included in the Provision\nfor income taxes for the period in which the\nchange is enacted. A valuation allowance is\nrecognized for a DTA, if based on the weight\nof available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that some portion or all of the DTA will\nnot be realized.\nInterest and penalties related to the\nCompany\u2019s tax positions are recognized in the\nProvision for income taxes in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s activities\nrelated to income taxes, see \"Note 14. Income\nTaxes.\"\n               Truist Financial Corporation 95\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company records derivative contracts at\nfair value in Other assets and Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Accounting for changes in the fair\nvalue of a derivative depends upon whether or\nnot it has been designated in a formal,\nqualifying hedging relationship. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives not designated\nin a hedging relationship are recognized\nwithin Noninterest income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. This includes\nderivatives that the Company enters into in a\ndealer capacity to facilitate client\ntransactions and as a risk management tool to\neconomically hedge certain identified risks\nassociated with assets carried at fair value\nsuch as MSRs, along with certain interest rate\nlock commitments on residential mortgage and\ncommercial loans that are a normal part of the\nCompany\u2019s operations. The Company also\nevaluates contracts, such as brokered deposits\nand debt, to determine whether any embedded\nderivatives are required to be bifurcated and\nseparately accounted for as freestanding\nderivatives.\nCertain derivatives used as risk management\ntools are designated as accounting hedges and\nare used to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates or other identified\nmarket risks. The Company prepares written\nhedge documentation for all derivatives which\nare designated as hedges of (i) changes in the\nfair value of a recognized asset or liability\n(fair value hedge) attributable to a specified\nrisk or (ii) a forecasted transaction, such as\nthe variability of cash flows to be received\nor paid related to a recognized asset or\nliability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge\ndocumentation includes identification of,\namong other items, the risk management\nobjective, hedging instrument, hedged item,\nand methodologies for assessing and measuring\nhedge effectiveness, along with support for\nmanagement\u2019s assertion that the hedge will be\nhighly effective. Methodologies related to\nhedge effectiveness include (i) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the cash\nflows of the actual derivative and\nhypothetical derivatives, or (ii) statistical\nregression analysis of changes in the fair\nvalues of the actual derivative and the hedged\nitem.\nFor designated hedging relationships, the\nCompany generally performs subsequent\nassessments of hedge effectiveness using a\nqualitative approach.\n                                              \n                 Cash Flow      Fair Value    \n                 Hedges

The Company\nmanages its exposures to counterparty credit\nrisk associated with derivatives by entering\ninto transactions with counterparties with\ndefined exposure limits based on their credit\nquality and in accordance with established\npolicies and procedures. All counterparties\nare reviewed regularly as part of the\nCompany\u2019s credit risk management practices and\nappropriate action is taken to adjust the\nexposure limits to certain counterparties as\nnecessary. The Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions are generally governed by ISDA\nagreements or other legally enforceable\nindustry standard master netting agreements.\nIn certain cases and depending on the nature\nof the underlying derivative transactions,\nbilateral collateral agreements are also\nutilized.\n96 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject\nto OTC derivative clearing requirements, which\nrequire certain derivatives to be cleared\nthrough central clearing houses. These\nclearing houses require the Company to post\ninitial and variation margin to mitigate the\nrisk of non-payment, the latter of which is\nreceived or paid daily based on the net asset\nor liability of the contracts. The Company\napplies settlement to market treatment for the\ncash collateralizing derivative contracts with\ncertain centrally cleared counterparties.\nDerivative balances with these counterparties\nare considered settled by the collateral, and\nthe implementation of the settlement to market\ntreatment was applied based on the effective\ndate of rulebook changes made by the\napplicable counterparties.\n\nWhen the Company has more than one outstanding\nderivative transaction with a single\ncounterparty, and there exists a legal right\nof setoff with that counterparty, the Company\nconsiders its exposure to the counterparty to\nbe the net fair value of its derivative\npositions with that counterparty. If the net\nfair value is positive, then the corresponding\nasset value also reflects cash collateral\nheld. The Company offsets derivative\ntransactions with a single counterparty as\nwell as any cash collateral paid to and\nreceived from that counterparty for derivative\ncontracts that are subject to ISDA or other\nlegally enforceable netting arrangements and\nmeet accounting guidance for offsetting\ntreatment.\n\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nderivative activities, see \"Note 18. Fair\nValue Disclosures\" and \"Note 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\"\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the\nfair value of net assets acquired (including\nidentifiable intangibles) in transactions\naccounted for as business combinations. Truist\nallocates goodwill to the reporting unit(s)\nthat are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the business combination.\nThe goodwill of each reporting unit is\nreviewed for impairment on an annual basis as\nof October 1 or more often if events or\ncircumstances indicate that it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying value. If, after\nassessing all relevant events or\ncircumstances, Truist concludes that it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying value,\nthen an impairment test is required. Truist\nmay also elect to bypass the qualitative\nassessment and proceed directly to the\nimpairment test. In the quantitative test, the\nfair value of a reporting unit is compared to\nthe carrying value of the reporting unit. If\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is greater\nthan the carrying value, then there is no\nimpairment. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying value, then an impairment loss is\nrecorded for the amount that the carrying\nvalue exceeds the fair value, not to exceed\nthe total amount of goodwill assigned to the\nreporting unit. The quantitative impairment\ntest estimates the fair value of the reporting\nunits using the income approach and market\nbased approaches. The income approach utilizes\na discounted cash flow analysis. The market\napproach utilizes comparable public company\ninformation, key valuation multiples and\nconsideration of a market control premium\nassociated with cost synergies and other cash\nflow benefits that arise from obtaining\ncontrol over a reporting unit, and guideline\ntransactions, when applicable.\nThe inputs and assumptions specific to each\nreporting unit are incorporated in the\nvaluations, including projections of future\ncash flows, discount rates and applicable\nvaluation multiples based on comparable public\ncompany information. Truist also assesses the\nreasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting units by comparison to\nits market capitalization over a reasonable\nperiod of time, including consideration of\nhistoric bank control premiums and the current\nmarket.\nCDI and other intangible assets include\npremiums paid for acquisitions of core\ndeposits and other identifiable intangible\nassets. Intangible assets other than goodwill,\nwhich are determined to have finite lives, are\namortized over their useful lives, based upon\nthe estimated economic benefits received. For\nadditional information on the Company\u2019s\nactivities related to goodwill and other\nintangibles, see \"Note 7. Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets.\"\nLoan Servicing Rights\nTruist has three classes of servicing rights\nfor which it separately manages the economic\nrisks: residential MSRs, commercial MSRs, and\nother loan servicing rights. Loan servicing\nrights are accounted for primarily at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recorded in\nResidential mortgage income, Commercial\nmortgage income, and Other income on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. The fair\nvalue of servicing rights is impacted by a\nvariety of factors, including prepayment\nassumptions, discount rates, delinquency\nrates, contractually-specified servicing fees,\nservicing costs, and underlying portfolio\ncharacteristics. These risks are hedged with\nvarious derivative instruments that are\nintended to mitigate the income statement\neffect to changes in fair value. The\nunderlying assumptions and estimated values\nare corroborated by values received from\nindependent third parties and comparisons to\nmarket transactions. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s servicing rights,\nsee \"Note 8. Loan Servicing.\"\n               Truist Financial Corporation 97\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Depending on the nature of the asset or\nliability, the Company uses various valuation\ntechniques and assumptions when estimating\nfair value. The Company classifies inputs used\nin valuation techniques within the fair value\nhierarchy discussed in \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nWhen measuring assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue, the Company considers the principal or\nmost advantageous market in which it would\ntransact and considers assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset\nor liability. Assets and liabilities that are\nrequired to be measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis include trading securities,\nderivative instruments, AFS securities, and\ncertain other equity securities. Assets and\nliabilities that the Company has elected to\nmeasure at fair value on a recurring basis\ninclude trading loans, loans originated to be\nsold and classified as LHFS, and loan\nservicing rights. Other assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, such as when assets are evaluated for\nimpairment, and subsequently carried at LOCOM.\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s\nvaluation of assets and liabilities held at\nfair value, see \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures.\"\nEquity-Based Compensation\nTruist maintains various equity-based\ncompensation plans that provide for the\ngranting of RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs to selected\nteammates and directors. Truist values share-\nbased awards at the grant date fair value and\nrecognizes the expense over the requisite\nservice period taking into account retirement\neligibility. Compensation expense is\nrecognized in Personnel expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Forfeitures\nare recognized as they occur. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation plans, see \"Note 15. Benefit\nPlans.\"\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nTruist offers various pension plans and\npostretirement benefit plans to teammates.\nCalculation of the obligations and related\nexpenses under these plans requires the use of\nactuarial valuation methods and assumptions.\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure\nthe postretirement benefit obligations is set\nby reference to an AA Above Median corporate\nbond yield curve and the individual\ncharacteristics of the plans such as projected\ncash flow patterns and payment durations. The\nexpected long-term rate of return on assets is\nbased on the expected returns for each major\nasset class in which the plan invests,\nadjusted for the weight of each asset class in\nthe target mix.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCompany recognizes two primary types of\nrevenue in its Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, Interest income, and Noninterest\nincome. The Company\u2019s principal source of\nrevenue is Interest income from loans and\nsecurities, which is recognized on an accrual\nbasis using the effective interest method. For\ninformation on the Company\u2019s policies for\nrecognizing Interest income on loans and\nsecurities, see the \"Loans and Leases,\"\n\"LHFS,\" \"Trading Activities,\" and \"Investment\nSecurities\" sections within this Note.\nNoninterest income includes revenue from\nvarious types of transactions and services\nprovided to clients. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from contracts with customers as\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nPerformance obligations are typically\nsatisfied in one year or less. Truist elected\nthe practical expedient to expense the\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract when\nincurred when the amortization period is one\nyear or less. As of December 31, 2021 and\n2020, remaining performance obligations\nconsisted primarily of insurance and\ninvestment banking services for contracts with\nan original expected length of one year or\nless.\nInsurance income\nInsurance commissions are received on the sale\nof insurance products as agent or broker, and\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time upon\nthe placement date of the insurance policies,\nrepresenting the Company\u2019s related performance\nobligations. Payment is normally received\nwithin the policy period. In addition to\nplacement, Truist also provides insurance\npolicy related risk management services. The\nCompany\u2019s execution of these risk management\nservices represents its performance\nobligations. Revenue is recognized over time\nas these services are provided. Performance-\nbased commissions are recognized when received\nor earlier when, upon consideration of past\nresults and current conditions, the revenue is\ndeemed not probable of reversal. Insurance\ncommissions are included in the IH operating\nsegment. Refer to \"Note 21. Operating\nSegments\" for information on segment results.\n98 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues\n\nTransaction and service-based revenues include\nWealth management income, Investment banking\nincome, Service charges on deposits, and Card\nand payment related fees. Revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time when the\ntransactions occur or over time as services\nare performed over primarily monthly or\nquarterly periods. Payment is typically\nreceived in the period the transactions occur\nor, in some cases, within 90 days of the\nservice period. Fees may be fixed or, where\napplicable, based on a percentage of\ntransaction size or managed assets. These\nrevenues, and their relationship to the\nCompany\u2019s operating segments, are further\ndescribed by type below. Refer to \"Note 21.\nOperating Segments\" for information on segment\nresults.\n\nWealth management income includes trust and\ninvestment management income, retail\ninvestment and brokerage services, and\ninvestment advisory and other specialty wealth\nmanagement fees. The Company\u2019s execution of\nthese services represents its related\nperformance obligations. The Company generally\nrecognizes trust and investment management and\nadvisory revenue over time as services are\nrendered based on either a percentage of the\nmarket value of the assets under management or\nadvisement, or fixed based on the services\nprovided to the client. Fees are generally\nswept from the client\u2019s account either in\nadvance of or in arrears based on the prior\nperiod\u2019s asset balances under management or\nadvisement. The Company also offers selling\nand distribution services and earns\ncommissions through the sale of annuity and\nmutual fund products, acting as agent in these\ntransactions and recognizing revenue at a\npoint in time when the client enters into an\nagreement with the product carrier. The\nCompany may also receive trailing commissions\nand 12b-1 fees related to mutual fund and\nannuity products and recognizes this revenue\nin the period earned. Retail trade execution\ncommissions are earned and recognized on the\ntrade date with payment on the settlement\ndate. Wealth management income is included in\nthe CB&W operating segment.\n\nInvestment banking and trading income includes\nsecurities underwriting fees, advisory fees,\nloan syndication fees, structured real estate\nincome, and trade execution services revenue.\nUnderwriting fees are earned on the trade date\nwhen the Company, as a member of an\nunderwriting syndicate, purchases the\nsecurities from the issuer and sells the\nsecurities to third party investors. Each\nmember of the syndicate is responsible for\nselling its portion of the underwriting and is\nliable for the proportionate costs of the\nunderwriting; therefore, the Company\u2019s portion\nof underwriting revenue and expense is\npresented gross within noninterest income and\nnoninterest expense. The transaction price is\nbased on a percentage of the total transaction\namount and payments are settled shortly after\nthe trade date. Fees for merger and\nacquisition advisory services, including\nvarious activities such as business valuation,\nidentification of potential targets or\nacquirers, and the issuance of fairness\nopinions, are generally earned and recognized\nby the Company when performance obligations\nare satisfied. The Company\u2019s execution of the\nadvisory services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. The transaction price is based on\ncontractually specified terms agreed upon with\nthe client for each advisory service. Loan\nsyndication fees are typically recognized at\nthe closing of a loan syndication transaction.\nRevenue related to corporate trade execution\nservices is earned and recognized on the trade\ndate with payment on the settlement date.\nInvestment banking and trading income is\nincluded in the C&CB operating segment.\n\nService charges on deposits include account\nmaintenance, cash and treasury management,\nwire transfers, ATM, overdraft and other\ndeposit-related fees. The Company\u2019s execution\nof the services related to these fees\nrepresents its performance obligations. Each\nof these performance obligations are either\nsatisfied over time or at a point in time as\nthe services are provided to the client. The\nCompany is the principal when rendering these\nservices. Payments for services provided are\neither withdrawn from client accounts as\nservices are rendered or in the billing period\nfollowing the completion of the service. The\ntransaction price for each of these fees is\nbased on the Company\u2019s predetermined fee\nschedules. Service charges on deposits are\nrecognized in the CB&W and C&CB operating\nsegments.\n\nCard and payment related fees include\ninterchange fees from credit and debit cards,\nmerchant acquirer revenue, and other card\nrelated services. Interchange fees are earned\nby the Company each time a request for payment\nis initiated by a client at a merchant for\nwhich the Company transfers the funds on\nbehalf of the client. Interchange rates are\nset by the payment network and are based on\npurchase volumes and other factors.\nInterchange fees are received daily and\nrecognized at a point in time when the card\ntransaction is processed, which represents the\nCompany\u2019s related performance obligation. The\nCompany is considered an agent of the client\nand incurs costs with the payment network to\nfacilitate the interchange with the merchant;\ntherefore, the related payment network expense\nis recognized as a reduction of card fees.\nTruist also offers rewards and/or rebates to\nits client based on card usage. The costs\nassociated with these programs are recognized\nas a reduction of card fees. Card and payment\nrelated fees are recognized in the CB&W and\nC&CB operating segments.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is\ncomputed by dividing net income available to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during\neach period, plus common share equivalents\ncalculated for stock options, warrants, and\nrestricted stock outstanding using the\ntreasury stock method. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s EPS, see \"Note\n20. Computation of EPS.\"\n               Truist Financial Corporation 99\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company periodically enters into\ntransactions with certain of its executive\nofficers, directors, affiliates, trusts,\nand/or other related parties in its ordinary\ncourse of business. The Company is required to\ndisclose material related party transactions,\nother than certain compensation and other\narrangements entered into in the normal course\nof business.

Securities Financing Activities     \n                                              \nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell are primarily collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment or agency securities and are\ncarried at the amounts at which the securities\nwill be subsequently sold, plus accrued\ninterest. Securities borrowed are primarily\ncollateralized by corporate securities. The\nCompany borrows securities and purchases\nsecurities under agreements to resell as part\nof its securities financing activities. On the\nacquisition date of these securities, the\nCompany and the related counterparty agree on\nthe amount of collateral required to secure\nthe principal amount loaned under these\narrangements. The Company monitors collateral\nvalues daily and calls for additional\ncollateral to be provided as warranted under\nthe respective agreements. At December 31,\n2021 and 2020, the total market value of\ncollateral held was $ 4.0billion and $\n1.7billion, of which $ 1.1billion and $\n27million was repledged, respectively.

These macro-economic\nforecasts include a number of key economic\nvariables utilized in loss forecasting that\ninclude, but are not limited to, unemployment\ntrends, US real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nrental rates, property values, the primary\n30-year mortgage rate, home price indices, and\nused car prices.\n\nThe primary economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the December 31, 2021 ACL. The\nprimary economic forecast shaping the ACL\nestimate at December 31, 2021 included GDP\ngrowth starting in the mid-high single digits\ndeclining to the low single digits by the end\nof 2022, and an improving unemployment rate\nstarting in the mid-single digits and\nimproving through the end of the reasonable\nand supportable period.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The December\n31, 2021 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

predictive of future performance. As\nindicated, changes in fair value based on\nadverse changes in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the\nrelationship of the change in assumption to\nthe change in fair value may not be linear.\nAlso, in the above table, the effect of an\nadverse variation in one assumption on the\nfair value of the MSRs is calculated without\nchanging any other assumption; while in\nreality, changes in one factor may result in\nchanges in another, which may magnify or\ncounteract the effect of the change.

The Company\u2019s\nfederal income tax returns are no longer\nsubject to examination by the IRS for taxable\nyears prior to 2017. With limited exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to\nexamination by state and local taxing\nauthorities for taxable years prior to 2015.\nIt is reasonably possible that the liability\nfor unrecognized tax benefits could decrease\nby as much as $ 30million during the next 12\nmonths due to completion of tax authority\nexaminations and the expiration of statutes of\nlimitations. It is uncertain how much, if any,\nof this potential decrease will impact the\nCompany\u2019s effective tax rate.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 117\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Prior periods were\nrevised consistent with the current\npresentation.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nTruist offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other\ndefined contribution plans that permit\nteammates to contribute up to 50% of cash\ncompensation. For full-time teammates who are\n21years of age or older with one year or more\nof service, Truist makes matching\ncontributions of up to 6% of the employee's\ncompensation. The Company\u2019s contribution\nexpense for the 401(k) Savings Plan and\nnonqualified defined contribution plans\ntotaled $ 272million, $ 272million and $\n152million for the years ended December 31,\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Certain\nteammates of subsidiaries participate in the\n401(k) Savings Plan with different matching\nformulas. The Company\u2019s defined contribution\nplans obtained through the Merger were\ncombined during 2020.\n\nEquity-Based Compensation Plans\n\nAt December 31, 2021, RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs\nwere outstanding from equity-based\ncompensation plans that have been approved by\nshareholders and plans assumed from acquired\nentities. Those plans are intended to assist\nthe Company in recruiting and retaining\nteammates, directors, and independent\ncontractors and to align the interests of\neligible participants with those of Truist and\nits shareholders.\n\nThe majority of outstanding awards and awards\navailable to be issued relate to plans that\nallow for accelerated vesting of awards for\nholders who retire and have met all retirement\neligibility requirements or in connection with\ncertain other events. Until vested, certain of\nthese awards are subject to forfeiture under\nspecified circumstances. The fair value of\nRSUs and PSUs is based on the common stock\nprice on the grant date less the present value\nof expected dividends that will be foregone\nduring the vesting period. Substantially all\nawards are granted in February of each year.\nGrants to non-executive teammates primarily\nconsist of RSUs.\n                                              \n  December 31, 2021                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Shares available for                        \n  future grants (in        13,146             \n  thousands)                                  \n  Vesting period,                  1.0 year   \n  minimum                                     \n  Vesting period,                  5.0 years  \n  maximum                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  /                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2\u2026           2\u2026            2\u2026       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  3\u2026        $  3\u2026         $  1\u2026       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       75           84            38       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       4\u2026           4\u2026            2\u2026       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       3\u2026           4\u2026            1\u2026       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2\u2026           2\u2026            2\u2026       \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           2\u2026           2.3           2.3  \n  \u2026           y\u2026           ye\u2026           ye\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n120 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n                                   Wtd.

Commitments and Contingencies      \n                                              \nTruist utilizes a variety of financial\ninstruments to mitigate exposure to risks and\nmeet the financing needs and provide\ninvestment opportunities for clients. These\nfinancial instruments include commitments to\nextend credit, letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, derivatives, and other\ninvestments. Truist also has commitments to\nfund certain affordable housing investments\nand contingent liabilities related to certain\nsold loans.\n\nTax Credit and Certain Equity Investments\n\nThe Company invests in certain affordable\nhousing projects throughout its market area as\na means of supporting local communities.\nTruist receives tax credits related to these\ninvestments, for which the Company typically\nacts as a limited partner and therefore does\nnot exert control over the operating or\nfinancial policies of the partnerships. Truist\ntypically provides financing during the\nconstruction and development of the\nproperties; however, permanent financing is\ngenerally obtained from independent third\nparties upon completion of a project. Tax\ncredits are subject to recapture by taxing\nauthorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level.\nTruist's maximum potential exposure to losses\nrelative to investments in VIEs is generally\nlimited to the sum of the outstanding balance,\nfuture funding commitments and any related\nloans to the entity, exclusive of any\npotential tax recapture associated with the\ninvestments. Loans to these entities are\nunderwritten in substantially the same manner\nas the Company\u2019s other loans and are generally\nsecured.\n\nAdditionally, the Company invests in other\ncommunity development entities as a limited\npartner and/or a lender. The Company receives\ntax credits for its limited partner\ninvestments. The Company has determined that\nthe majority of the related partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these investments.\nTruist uses the equity method of accounting\nfor these investments.\n\nThe Company also invests in entities that\npromote renewable energy sources as a limited\npartner. The Company has determined that these\nrenewable energy tax credit partnerships are\nVIEs. The Company has concluded that it is not\nthe primary beneficiary of these VIEs because\nit does not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIEs' financial performance and therefore, it\nis not required to consolidate these VIEs. The\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to\nthese investments is limited to its equity\ninvestments in these partnerships and any\nadditional unfunded equity commitments.\n\nTruist has investments in and future funding\ncommitments related to private equity and\ncertain other equity method investments. The\nrisk exposure relating to such commitments is\ngenerally limited to the amount of investments\nand future funding commitments made.\n                                              \n  Decemb\u2026

Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, Truist\nutilizes certain financial instruments to meet\nthe financing needs of clients and to mitigate\nexposure to risks. Such financial instruments\ninclude commitments to extend credit and\ncertain contractual agreements, including\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantee arrangements.\n\nCommitments to extend, originate, or purchase\ncredit are primarily lines of credit to\nbusinesses and consumers and have specified\nrates and maturity dates. Many of these\ncommitments also have adverse change clauses,\nwhich allow Truist to cancel the commitment\ndue to deterioration in the borrowers'\ncreditworthiness. The fair values of\ncommitments are estimated using the fees\ncharged to enter into similar agreements,\ntaking into account the remaining terms of the\nagreements and the present creditworthiness of\nthe counterparties. The fair values of\nguarantees and letters of credit are estimated\nbased on the counterparties' creditworthiness\nand average default rates for loan products\nwith similar risks. Consumer lending and\nrevolving credit commitments have an\nimmaterial fair value as Truist typically has\nthe unconditional ability to cancel such\ncommitments. Refer to \"Note 18. Fair Value\nDisclosures\" for additional disclosures on the\nRUFC.\n\nTruist has sold certain mortgage-related loans\nthat contain recourse provisions. These\nprovisions generally require Truist to\nreimburse the investor for a share of any loss\nthat is incurred after the disposal of the\nproperty. Truist also issues standard\nrepresentations and warranties related to\nmortgage loan sales to GSEs. Refer to \"Note 8.\nLoan Servicing\" for additional disclosures\nrelated to these exposures.\n\nLetters of credit and financial guarantees are\nunconditional commitments issued by Truist to\nguarantee the performance of a client to a\nthird party. These guarantees are primarily\nissued to support borrowing arrangements,\nincluding commercial paper issuance, bond\nfinancing and similar transactions. The credit\nrisk involved in the issuance of these\nguarantees is essentially the same as that\ninvolved in extending loans to clients and, as\nsuch, the instruments are collateralized when\nnecessary.\n                                              \n  December 31,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)               2021          2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Commitments to                              \n  extend,                                     \n  originate, or     $  198,658    $  186,731  \n  purchase                                    \n  credit                                      \n  Residential                                 \n  mortgage loans           244           328  \n  sold with                                   \n  recourse                                    \n  CRE mortgages                               \n  serviced for                                \n  others                10,243         9,019  \n  covered by                                  \n  recourse                                    \n  provisions                                  \n  Other loans                                 \n  serviced for                                \n  others covered           588             \u2014  \n  by recourse                                 \n  provisions                                  \n  Letters of             5,568         5,066  \n  credit                                      \n                                              \nDerivatives\n\nTruist enters into derivative contracts to\nmanage various financial risks. A derivative\nis a financial instrument that derives its\ncash flows, and therefore its value, by\nreference to an underlying instrument, index,\nor referenced interest rate. Derivative\ncontracts are carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets with the fair\nvalue representing the net present value of\nexpected future cash receipts or payments\nbased on market interest rates. For additional\ninformation on derivative instruments, see\n\"Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.\"\n\n122 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTotal Return Swaps\n\nThe Company facilitates matched book TRS\ntransactions on behalf of clients, whereby a\nVIE purchases reference assets identified by a\nclient and the Company enters into a TRS with\nthe VIE, with a mirror-image TRS facing the\nclient. The Company provides senior financing\nto the VIE in the form of demand notes to fund\nthe purchase of the reference assets.\nReference assets are typically fixed income\ninstruments primarily composed of syndicated\nbank loans. The TRS contracts pass through\ninterest and other cash flows on the reference\nassets to the third party clients, along with\nexposing those clients to decreases in value\non the assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the assets. The\nterms of the TRS contracts require the third\nparties to post initial margin collateral, as\nwell as ongoing margin as the fair values of\nthe underlying reference assets change.\n\nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, that could potentially be\nsignificant. At December 31, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected\n$ 1.5billion of assets and $ 50million of\nother liabilities of the VIEs. At December 31,\n2020, the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet\nreflected $ 1.3billion of assets and $\n41million of other liabilities of the VIEs.\nVIE assets include trading loans and bonds\ntotaling $ 1.5billion and $ 1.3billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird party clients via the TRS contracts. For\nadditional information on TRS contracts and\nthe related VIEs, see \u201cNote 19. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nInvestment in Exchange Traded Fund\n\nIn December 2021, Truist and Sterling Capital\nManagement LLC, a registered investment\nadvisor and wholly owned subsidiary of Truist,\nestablished the Sterling Capital Diverse\nMulti-Manager Active Exchange Traded Fund to\ndemonstrate the Company\u2019s support for\nincreasing access for individuals and\ninstitutions to invest using strategies from\ndiverse-owned firms. This ETF combines active\nmanagement investment strategies from three\nmajority diverse-owned asset managers, the\nsub-advisors to the ETF. Each sub-advisor\nsubmits its strategy to Sterling Capital, the\nETF\u2019s investment advisor, for review and\nimplementation within the overall ETF\nportfolio. The Company concluded that the ETF\nis a VIE that should be consolidated as the\nCompany is the ETF\u2019s primary beneficiary. As\nof December 31, 2021, the Company consolidated\n$ 102million of equity securities held by the\nETF, which substantially represents the\nCompany\u2019s initial investment in the ETF and is\nclassified as Other assets within the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOther Commitments\n\nTruist holds public funds in certain states\nthat do not require 100% collateralization on\npublic fund bank deposits. In these states,\nshould the failure of another public fund\ndepository institution result in a loss for\nthe public entity, the resulting\nuncollateralized deposit shortfall would have\nto be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon\nthe public deposits held by each bank within\nthe respective state) by the remaining\nfinancial institutions holding public funds in\nthat state. Truist monitors deposits levels\nrelative to the total public deposits held by\nall depository institutions within these\nstates. The likelihood that the Company would\nhave to perform under this guarantee is\ndependent on whether any financial\ninstitutions holding public funds default, as\nwell as the adequacy of collateral coverage.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Truist\nindemnifies its officers and directors to the\nfullest extent permitted by law against\nliabilities arising from pending litigation.\nTruist also issues standard representations\nand warranties in underwriting agreements,\nmerger and acquisition agreements, loan sales,\nbrokerage activities and other similar\narrangements. Counterparties in many of these\nindemnification arrangements provide similar\nindemnifications to Truist. Although these\nagreements often do not specify limitations,\nTruist does not believe that any payments\nrelated to these guarantees would materially\nchange the financial position or results of\noperations of Truist.\n\nAs a member of the FHLB, Truist is required to\nmaintain a minimum investment in capital\nstock. The board of directors of the FHLB can\nincrease the minimum investment requirements\nin the event it has concluded that additional\ncapital is required to allow it to meet its\nown regulatory capital requirements. Any\nincrease in the minimum investment\nrequirements outside of specified ranges\nrequires the approval of the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency. Because the extent of any\nobligation to increase Truist's investment in\nthe FHLB depends entirely upon the occurrence\nof a future event, potential future\ninvestments in the FHLB stock are not\ndeterminable.\n\nThe Company utilizes the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation for trade comparisons, netting,\nand settlement of fixed income securities. As\na Government Securities Division netting\nmember, the Company has a commitment to the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation to meet its\nfinancial obligations as a central\ncounterparty clearing house in the event the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation has\ninsufficient liquidity recourses through a\npotential committed liquidity resource\nrepurchase transaction. Any commitment would\nbe based on the Company\u2019s share of its\nliquidity burden on the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. Truist does not believe that any\npayments related to these guarantees would\nmaterially change the financial position or\nresults of operations of Truist.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 123\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Certain assets related to\nthe nonqualified defined contribution\nretirement plan were added to the pledged\nsecurities in the table below. Prior periods\nwere revised consistent with the current\npresentation. Assets pledged to the FHLB and\nFRB are subject to applicable asset discounts\nwhen determining borrowing capacity. The\nCompany obtains secured financing and letters\nof credit from the FRB and FHLB.

The matters range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with multiple class members\nand can involve claims for substantial\namounts. Investigations involve both formal\nand informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations.\nThese legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration, or investigation\nand may consist of a variety of claims,\nincluding common law tort and contract claims,\nas well as statutory antitrust, securities,\nand consumer protection claims. The ultimate\nresolution of any proceeding is uncertain and\ninherently difficult to predict. It is\npossible that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters, if unfavorable, may be material to\nthe consolidated financial position,\nconsolidated results of operations, or\nconsolidated cash flows of Truist.\n\nTruist establishes accruals for legal matters\nwhen potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. There is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed\nthe amounts that Truist has accrued. Accruals\nfor legal matters are based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel\nand others.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 200million as of December 31,\n2021. This estimate is based upon currently\navailable information and involves\nconsiderable judgment, given that claims often\ninclude significant legal uncertainties,\ndamages alleged by plaintiffs are often\nunspecified or overstated, discovery may not\nhave started or may not be complete and\nmaterial facts may be disputed or\nunsubstantiated, among other factors. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nwill change from time to time and actual\nlosses may vary significantly from this\nestimate. As a result, the Company does not\nbelieve that an estimate of reasonably\npossible losses can be made for certain\nmatters. Such matters are not reflected in the\nestimate provided herein.\n\nThe following is a description of a certain\nlegal proceeding in which Truist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in the Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought\nclaims for violations of civil and criminal\nusury laws, conversion, and money had and\nreceived. On October 6, 2017, the trial court\ngranted plaintiff\u2019s motion for class\ncertification and defined the class as \u201cEvery\nGeorgia citizen who had or has one or more\naccounts with SunTrust Bank and who, from July\n12, 2006, to October 6, 2017 (i) had at least\none overdraft of $500.00 or less resulting\nfrom an ATM or debit card transaction (the\n\u201cTransaction\u201d); (ii) paid any Overdraft Fees\nas a result of the Transaction; and (iii) did\nnot receive a refund of those Fees,\u201d and the\ngranting of a certified class was affirmed on\nappeal. On April 8, 2020, the Company filed a\nmotion seeking to narrow the scope of this\nclass, and on May 29, 2020, it filed a renewed\nmotion to compel arbitration of the claims of\nsome of the class members. On February 9,\n2021, the trial court denied both motions as\npremature but held that the issues could be\nraised again after the conclusion of\ndiscovery, which is currently underway. The\nCompany believes that the claims are without\nmerit.\n\n124 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nNOTE 17. Regulatory Requirements and Other\nRestrictions\n\nTruist Bank is subject to laws and regulations\nthat limit the amount of dividends it can pay.\nIn addition, both Truist and Truist Bank are\nsubject to various regulatory restrictions\nrelating to the payment of dividends,\nincluding requirements to maintain capital at\nor above regulatory minimums, and to remain\n\"well-capitalized\" under the prompt corrective\naction regulations.\n\nTruist is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements administered by the\nFederal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements. Under capital\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the\nCompany must meet specific capital guidelines\nthat involve quantitative measures of assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems calculated pursuant to regulatory\ndirectives. Truist's capital amounts and\nclassification also are subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings and other factors. Truist is\nin full compliance with these requirements.\nBanking regulations also identify five capital\ncategories for IDIs: well-capitalized,\nadequately capitalized, undercapitalized,\nsignificantly undercapitalized, and critically\nundercapitalized. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, Truist and Truist Bank were classified\nas \"well-capitalized,\" and management believes\nthat no events or changes have occurred\nsubsequent to year end that would change this\ndesignation.\n\nQuantitative measures established by\nregulation to ensure capital adequacy require\nTruist to maintain minimum ratios of CET1\nratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%,\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of\n8.0%, Tier 1 capital to average tangible\nassets (leverage ratio) of 4.0% and\nsupplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Truist\nis subject to a 2.5% SCB effective October 1,\n2021 to September 30, 2022. Truist Bank is\nsubject to a 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nThe SCB and capital conservation buffer are\namounts above the minimum levels designed to\nensure that banks remain well-capitalized,\neven in adverse economic scenarios.\n\nRisk-based capital ratios, which include CET1,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital, are\ncalculated based on regulatory guidance\nrelated to the measurement of capital and\nrisk-weighted assets.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nAs an approved seller/servicer, Truist Bank is\nrequired to maintain minimum levels of\ncapital, as specified by various agencies,\nincluding the U.S. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, GNMA, FHLMC, and FNMA.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, investments\ntotaling $ 440million and $ 387million,\nrespectively, have been excluded from the\ntable above as they are valued based on net\nasset value as a practical expedient. These\ninvestments primarily consist of certain SBIC\nfunds.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques, and significant inputs\nfor Level 2, and Level 3 assets, and\nliabilities that are measured at fair value on\na recurring basis.\n\nAvailable for Sale and Trading Securities:\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include\nboth the available-for-sale and trading\nportfolios. The Company uses prices obtained\nfrom pricing services, dealer quotes, or\nrecent trades to estimate the fair value of\nsecurities. The majority of AFS securities\nwere priced by third party vendors whereas\ntrading securities are priced internally. The\nAFS securities and trading securities are\nsubject to IPV. Management independently\nevaluates the fair values of AFS Securities\nand trading securities through comparisons to\nexternal pricing sources, review of additional\ninformation provided by the pricing service\nand other third party sources for selected\nsecurities and back-testing to compare the\nprice realized on any security sales to the\npricing information received from the pricing\nservice. Fair value measurements for trading\nsecurities are derived from observable market-\nbased information including, but not limited\nto, overall market conditions, recent trades,\ncomparable securities, broker quotes and\nFINRA\u2019s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\ndata when determining the value of a position.\nSecurity prices are also validated through\nactual cash settlement upon the sale of a\nsecurity. As described by security type below,\nadditional inputs may be used, or some inputs\nmay not be applicable.\n\nTrading loans: The Company has elected to\nmeasure trading loans at fair value. Trading\nloans are valued primarily using quoted prices\nfor similar instruments in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active by\na third party pricing service. Trading loans\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 loans held in connection with the Company\u2019s\ntrading business primarily consisting of\ncommercial and corporate leveraged loans;\n\n\u2022 SBA loans guaranteed by the U.S. government;\nand\n\n\u2022 loans made or acquired in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s TRS business.\n\nU.S. Treasury securities: Treasury securities\nare valued using quoted prices in active over-\nthe-counter markets.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 127\nGSE securities and agency MBS: GSE securities\nconsist of debt obligations issued by HUD, the\nFHLB, and other agencies, as well as\nsecurities collateralized by loans that are\nguaranteed by the SBA, and thus, are backed by\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. Agency MBS includes pass-through\nsecurities and CMO issued by GSEs and U.S.\ngovernment agencies, such as FNMA, FHLMC, and\nGNMA. Each security contains a guarantee by\nthe issuing GSE or agency. GSE pass-through\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including benchmark TBA security\npricing and yield curves that were estimated\nbased on U.S. Treasury yields and certain\nfloating rate indices. The pricing matrices\nfor these securities may also give\nconsideration to pool-specific data supplied\ndirectly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valued using\nmarket-based pricing matrices that are based\non observable inputs including offers, bids,\nreported trades, dealer quotes and market\nresearch reports, the characteristics of a\nspecific tranche, market convention prepayment\nspeeds and benchmark yield curves as described\nabove.\n\nStates and political subdivisions: The\nCompany\u2019s investments in U.S. states and\npolitical subdivisions include obligations of\ncounty and municipal authorities and agency\nbonds, which are general obligations of the\nmunicipality or are supported by a specified\nrevenue source. Holdings are geographically\ndispersed, with no significant concentrations\nin any one state or municipality.\nAdditionally, all municipal obligations are\nhighly rated or are otherwise collateralized\nby securities backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the federal government. These\nsecurities are valued using market-based\npricing matrices that reference observable\ninputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer\nspreads, material event notices and benchmark\nyield curves.\n\nNon-agency MBS: Non-agency MBS included\npurchased interests in third party\nsecuritizations that have a high investment\ngrade rating, and the pricing matrices for\nthese securities were based on observable\ninputs including offers, bids, reported\ntrades, dealer quotes and market research\nreports, the characteristics of a specific\ntranche, market convention prepayment speeds\nand benchmark yield curves as described above;\nas such, these securities were classified as\nlevel 2.\n\nCorporate and other debt securities: These\nsecurities consist primarily of corporate\nbonds and commercial paper. Corporate bonds\nare senior and subordinated debt obligations\nof domestic corporations. The Company acquires\ncommercial paper that is generally short-term\nin nature and highly rated. These securities\nare valued based on a review of quoted market\nprices for similar assets as well as through\nthe various other inputs discussed previously.\n\nLHFS: Certain mortgage loans that are\noriginated to be sold to investors are carried\nat fair value. The fair value is primarily\nbased on quoted market prices for securities\nbacked by similar types of loans, adjusted for\nservicing, interest rate risk, and credit\nrisk. The changes in fair value of these\nassets are largely driven by changes in\ninterest rates subsequent to loan funding and\nchanges in the fair value of servicing\nassociated with the mortgage LHFS.\n\nLoans and leases: Fair values for loans are\nbased on a discounted cash flow methodology\nthat considered credit loss expectations,\nmarket interest rates, and other market\nfactors such as liquidity from the perspective\nof a market participant. The probability of\ndefault, loss given default, and prepayment\nassumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated\ncash flows. These assumptions are informed by\ninter nal data on loan characteristics,\nhistorical loss experience, and current and\nforecasted economic conditions. The interest\nand liquidity component of the estimate was\ndetermined by discounting interest and\nprincipal cash flows through the expected life\nof each loan. The discount rates used for\nloans are based on current market rates for\nnew originations of comparable loans and\ninclude adjustments for liquidity.\n\nLoan servicing rights: Residential MSRs are\nvalued using an OAS valuation model to project\ncash flows over multiple interest rate\nscenarios and then are discounted at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified\nservicing fees, prepayment assumptions,\ndelinquency rates, late charges, other\nancillary revenue, costs to service and other\neconomic factors. Fair value estimates and\nassumptions are compared to industry surveys,\nrecent market activity, actual portfolio\nexperience and other observable market data.\nCommercial MSRs and other loan servicing\nrights are valued using a cash flow valuation\nmodel that calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing cash flows. The\nCompany considers actual and expected loan\nprepayment rates, discount rates, servicing\ncosts, and other economic factors that are\ndetermined based on current market conditions.\nRefer to \u201cNote 8. Loan Servicing\u201d for\nadditional information on valuation techniques\nand inputs for loan servicing rights.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities: The Company\nholds derivative instruments for both trading\nand risk management purposes. These include\nexchange-traded futures or option contracts,\nOTC swaps, options, forwards and interest rate\nlock commitments. The fair values of\nderivatives are determined based on quoted\nmarket prices and internal pricing models that\nuse market observable assumptions for interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit.\nThe fair values of interest rate lock\ncommitments, which are related to mortgage\nloan commitments and are categorized as Level\n3, are based on quoted market prices adjusted\nfor commitments that are not expected to fund\nand include the value attributable to the net\nservicing fees. Funding rates are based on the\nCompany\u2019s historical data. The fair value\nattributable to servicing is based on\ndiscounted cash flows, and is impacted by\nprepayment assumptions, discount rates,\ndelinquency rates, contractually-specified\nservicing fees, servicing costs, and\nunderlying portfolio characteristics.\n\nEquity securities: Equity securities primarily\nconsist of exchange-traded securities and are\nvalued using quoted prices in active markets.\n\n128 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nPrivate equity investments: In many cases\nthere are no observable market values for\nthese investments and therefore management\nmust estimate the fair value based on a\ncomparison of the operating performance of the\ninvestee to multiples in the marketplace for\nsimilar entities. This analysis requires\nsignificant judgment, and actual values in a\nsale could differ materially from those\nestimated.\n\nSecurities sold short: Securities sold short\nrepresent debt securities sold short that are\nentered into as a hedging strategy for the\npurposes of supporting institutional and\nretail client trading activities. The fair\nvalue of securities sold short is determined\nin the same manner as trading securities.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \nDuring 2020, Truist sold non-agency MBS\npreviously categorized as Level 3 that\nrepresented ownership interests in various\ntranches of Re-REMIC trusts.

Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision. Therefore, the fair value estimates\nin many instances cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets. In\naddition, changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect these fair value\nestimates.

substance,\nwritten guarantees; specifically, risk\nparticipations, TRS, and credit default swaps.\nThe Company accounts for these contracts as\nderivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At December 31,\n2021, the remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one year\nto 10 years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\n                                              \n  December\u00a031,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)                                   \n  Risk participation                          \n  agreements:                2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Maximum potential       $   521    $   530  \n  amount of exposure                          \n  Total return swaps:                         \n  Cash collateral held        290        374  \n                                              \n134 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  December 31,                                \n  (Dollars in                                 \n  millions)                                   \n  Dealer and other                            \n  counterparties:           2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash and other                              \n  collateral            $    346    $    446  \n  received from                               \n  counterparties                              \n  Derivatives in a                            \n  net gain position                           \n  secured by                 506         585  \n  collateral                                  \n  received                                    \n  Unsecured                                   \n  positions in a net                          \n  gain with                  143          49  \n  counterparties                              \n  after collateral                            \n  postings                                    \n  Cash collateral                             \n  posted to dealer         1,704       1,524  \n  counterparties                              \n  Derivatives in a                            \n  net loss position        2,591       1,604  \n  secured by                                  \n  collateral                                  \n  Additional                                  \n  collateral that                             \n  would have                                  \n  been posted had                             \n  the Company\u2019s                3           3  \n  credit                                      \n  ratings dropped                             \n  below investment                            \n  grade                                       \n  Central                                     \n  counterparties                              \n  clearing:                                   \n  Cash collateral,                            \n  including initial                           \n  margin, posted to           31         172  \n  central clearing                            \n  parties                                     \n  Derivatives in a            18          90  \n  net loss position                           \n  Derivatives in a             \u2014           5  \n  net gain position                           \n  Securities pledged                          \n  to central                 904       1,281  \n  counterparties                              \n  clearing                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  NOTE 20.

Additionally, OT&C\nhouses intercompany eliminations, including\nintersegment net referral fees and residual\ninterest rate risk after segment allocations\nhave taken place.\n\nTruist emphasizes revenue growth through the\nCompany\u2019s Integrated Relationship Management\napproach, which is designed to deepen client\nrelationships and bring the full breadth and\ndepth of Truist\u2019s products and services to\nmeet clients\u2019 financial needs. The objective\nis to provide Truist\u2019s entire suite of\nproducts to its clients with the end goal of\nproviding clients the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. To promote\nrevenue growth, revenues of certain products\nand services are reflected in the results of\nthe segment providing those products and\nservices and are also allocated to CB&W and\nC&CB. These allocated revenues between\nsegments are reflected as net referral fees in\nnoninterest income and eliminated in OT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include, but are not limited to,\nthe items as detailed below.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax\nequivalent basis, related primarily to certain\ncommunity development investments. Recoveries\nfor these allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. If significant changes to management\nreporting methodologies take place, the impact\nof these changes is quantified and prior\nperiod information is revised, when\npracticable.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 137\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n138 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 22.

Company is\nrestricted. Federal law requires loans to the\nParent Company or its affiliates to be secured\nand at market terms and generally limits loans\nto the Parent Company or an individual\naffiliate to 10% of Truist Bank's unimpaired\ncapital and surplus. In the aggregate, loans\nto the Parent Company and all affiliates\ncannot exceed 20% of the bank's unimpaired\ncapital and surplus.\n\nDividend payments to the Parent Company by\nTruist Bank are subject to regulatory review\nand statutory limitations and, in some\ninstances, regulatory approval. In general,\ndividends from Truist Bank to the Parent\nCompany are limited by rules which compare\ndividends to net income for regulatory-defined\nperiods. Furthermore, dividends are restricted\nby regulatory minimum capital constraints.\n\n140 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 9A.

The\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP. Truist\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that (1) pertain\nto the maintenance of records, that in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and disposition of\nthe Company\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit the preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP\nand that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with\nthe authorizations of Truist\u2019s management and\ndirectors; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material impact on the financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate due to changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies and procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the\nparticipation of management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer, the Company conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the\ninternal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission, commonly referred to as\nthe \"COSO\" criteria. Based on this evaluation\nunder the COSO criteria, management concluded\nthat the internal control over financial\nreporting was effective as of December 31,\n2021.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated\nin their accompanying report, which expresses\nan unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes\nin Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this\nreport, the management of the Company, under\nthe supervision and with the participation of\nthe Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, carried out an\nevaluation of the Company\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that the\nCompany\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective.\n\nThere was no change in the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the fourth quarter of 2021 that has\nmaterially affected, or is likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n              Truist Financial Corporation 141\nITEM 15.
