Basis of Presentation               \n                                              \nGeneral\n\nSee the Glossary of Defined Terms at the\nbeginning of this Report for terms used\nherein. These consolidated financial\nstatements and notes are presented in\naccordance with the instructions for Form\n10-Q, and, therefore, do not include all\ninformation and notes necessary for a complete\npresentation of financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flow activity required in\naccordance with GAAP. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair statement of the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations have been\nmade. The year-end consolidated balance sheet\ndata was derived from audited annual financial\nstatements but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the annual financial\nstatements. The information contained in the\nfinancial statements and notes included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 should be referred to in\nconnection with these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company\nupdated its accounting policies in connection\nwith recently adopted accounting standards, as\napplicable, which are described in this\nfootnote. There were no other significant\nchanges to the Company\u2019s accounting policies\nfrom those disclosed in the Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nthat could have a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities\nas held for sale when management, having the\nauthority to approve the action, commits to a\nplan to sell the disposal group, the sale is\nprobable to occur within one year, and the\ndisposal group is available for immediate sale\nin its present condition. The Company also\nconsiders whether an active program to locate\na buyer has been initiated, whether the\ndisposal group is marketed actively for sale\nat a price that is reasonable in relation to\nits current fair value, and whether actions\nrequired to complete the plan indicate it is\nunlikely significant changes to the plan will\nbe made or the plan will be withdrawn. An\nasset or business that meets the criteria for\nheld for sale classification is reported as\ndiscontinued operations when the disposal\nrepresents a strategic shift that has had or\nwill have a major effect on the Company\u2019s\noperating results.\nAssets and liabilities of discontinued\noperations are presented separately in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets for prior periods\ncommencing in the period in which the asset or\nbusiness meets all of the held for sale\ncriteria described above. Net income from\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, is\nseparately reported in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income for current and prior\nperiods commencing in the period in which the\nasset or business meets all of the held for\nsale criteria described above, including any\ngain or loss recognized on the sale or\nadjustment of the carrying amount to fair\nvalue less cost to sell.\nCertain activity of TIH impacting the\nCompany's footnote disclosures has been\nremoved or revised. The footnote disclosures\nincluded herein are presented on a continuing\noperations basis, unless otherwise noted.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information.\nSegment Realignment\nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. The segment disclosures\nhave been revised to reflect the new\nstructure. Refer to \u201cNote 18.

Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Material estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant change\ninclude the determination of the ACL;\ndetermination of fair value for securities,\nMSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and derivative\nassets and liabilities; goodwill and other\nintangible assets; income taxes; and pension\nand postretirement benefit obligations.\nChanges in Accounting Principles and Effects\nof New Accounting Pronouncements\n                                              \n                 Description                  \n                 Improves                     \n                 reportable                   \n                 segment                      \n                 disclosure                   \n                 requiremen\u2026                  \n                 primarily                    \n                 through                      \n                 enhanced                     \n                 disclosures                  \n                 about                        \n                 significant                  \n                 segment                      \n                 expenses.                    \n                 Improves                     \n                 the                          \n                 transparen\u2026                  \n                 of income                    \n                 tax            Effects on    \n                 disclosures    the           \n                 by             Financial     \n                 requiring      Statements    \n                 (1)            Truist is     \n                 consistent     evaluating    \n                 categories     the impact    \n                 and greater    of this       \n                 disaggrega\u2026    standard on   \n                 of             its           \n                 information    disclosures.  \n  Standard /     in the rate    This          \n  Adoption       reconcilia\u2026    standard      \n  Date           and (2)        relates to    \n  Standards      income         footnote      \n  Not Yet        taxes paid     disclosures   \n  Adopted        disaggrega\u2026    only.         \n  Improvemen\u2026    by             Truist is     \n  to             jurisdicti\u2026    evaluating    \n  Reportable     It also        the impact    \n  Segment        includes       of this       \n  Disclosures    certain        standard on   \n  December       other          its           \n  31, 2024       amendments     disclosures.  \n  Improvemen\u2026    to improve     This          \n  to Income      the            standard      \n  Tax            effectiven\u2026    relates to    \n  Disclosures    of income      footnote      \n  January 1,     tax            disclosures   \n  2025           disclosure\u2026    only.         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 2.

The decrease\nin the commercial ALLL primarily reflects a\ndecrease in commercial loan balances that was\npartially offset by an increased reserve rate\nin the commercial real estate portfolio. The\nchange in the consumer ALLL primarily reflects\nlower loan balances that were largely offset\nby a higher reserve rate on the nonprime auto\nlending portfolio. The commercial ALLL\nincreased $ 11million and the consumer ALLL\ndecreased $ 23million in the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024. The increase in the commercial\nALLL primarily reflects an increase in\nreserves related to the CRE and commercial\nconstruction portfolios, partially offset by a\ndecrease in commercial loan balances. The\nchange in the consumer ALLL was primarily\ndriven by a decrease in loan balances that was\npartially offset by an increase in reserve\nrates related to certain consumer non-real\nestate portfolios.\n\nThe quantitative models have been designed to\nestimate losses using macro-economic forecasts\nover a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod of two years, followed by a reversion\nto long-term historical loss conditions over a\none-year period. Forecasts of macroeconomic\nvariables used in loss forecasting include,\nbut are not limited to, unemployment trends,\nU.S. real GDP, corporate credit spreads,\nproperty values, home price indices, and used\ncar prices.\n\nThe overall economic forecast incorporates a\nthird-party baseline forecast that is adjusted\nto reflect Truist\u2019s interest rate outlook.\nManagement also considers optimistic and\npessimistic third-party macro-economic\nforecasts in order to capture uncertainty in\nthe economic environment. These forecasts,\nalong with the primary economic forecast, are\nweighted 40% baseline, 30% optimistic, and 30%\npessimistic in the June 30, 2024 ACL,\nunchanged since December 31, 2023. While the\nscenario weightings were unchanged, the\neconomic outlook relative to the prior period\nvaried by economic variable and time period.\nThe economic outlook generally reflected\nimprovement in the Housing Price Index,\nsoftness in GDP growth, and no material change\nin forecasted unemployment compared to the\nprior quarter. The overall economic forecast\nshaping the ACL estimate at June 30, 2024\nincluded GDP growth in the low-single digits\nand an unemployment rate near the mid-single\ndigits.\n\nQuantitative models have certain limitations\nwith respect to estimating expected losses,\nparticularly in times of rapidly changing\nmacro-economic conditions and forecasts. As a\nresult, management believes that the\nqualitative component of the ACL, which\nincorporates management\u2019s expert judgment\nrelated to expected future credit losses, will\ncontinue to be an important component of the\nACL for the foreseeable future. The June 30,\n2024 ACL estimate includes adjustments to\nconsider the impact of current and expected\nevents or risks not captured by the loss\nforecasting models, the outcomes of which are\nuncertain and may not be completely considered\nby quantitative models.

Goodwill and Other Intangible       \n  Assets                                      \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. Following the realignment\nof these business activities, the Company\u2019s\nthree reporting units with goodwill balances\nare CSBB, WB, and Wealth.\n\nIn conjunction with these realignments,\ngoodwill of $ 1.7billion was realigned to WB\nfrom CSBB based on the relative fair value of\nCSBB and Wealth, and goodwill of $ 220million\nwas realigned to CSBB from WB based on the\nrelative fair value of WB and the realigned\nsmall business banking client segmentation. In\naddition, the Company completed an assessment\nof any potential goodwill impairment for all\nimpacted reporting units immediately prior and\nsubsequent to the realignments and determined\nthat no impairment existed. The quantitative\nvaluation of WB performed in conjunction with\nthese goodwill realignments indicated that as\nof January 1, 2024, the fair value of the WB\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value by\nless than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of\nthe WB reporting unit may be at risk of\nimpairment.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from January 1, 2024 to June\n30, 2024, including macroeconomic and market\nfactors, industry and banking sector events,\nTruist specific performance indicators, a\ncomparison of management\u2019s forecast and\nassumptions to those used in its January 1,\n2024 quantitative valuations associated with\nthe realignments of goodwill, and the\nsensitivity of the January 1, 2024\nquantitative results to changes in assumptions\nas of June 30, 2024. Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of June 30,\n2024.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill\nattributable to operating segments are\nreflected in the table below.

Reference\nassets are typically fixed income instruments\nprimarily composed of syndicated bank loans.\nThe TRS contracts pass through interest and\nother cash flows on the reference assets to\nthe third-party clients, along with exposing\nthose clients to decreases in value on the\nreference assets and providing them with the\nrights to appreciation on the reference\nassets. The terms of the TRS contracts require\nthe third party clients to post initial margin\ncollateral, as well as ongoing variation\nmargin as the fair values of the underlying\nreference assets change. The following table\nprovides a summary of the TRS transactions\nwith the associated VIE referenced assets,\nwhich include trading loans and bonds:\n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total                                       \n  return                                      \n  swaps:                                      \n  VIE          $       1,833    $      1,641  \n  assets                                      \n  Trading                                     \n  loans and            1,676           1,572  \n  bonds                                       \n  VIE                    273              50  \n  liabilit\u2026                                   \n                                              \nThe Company concluded that the associated VIEs\nshould be consolidated because the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (ii) the obligation\nto absorb losses and the right to receive\nbenefits, which could potentially be\nsignificant. The activities of the VIEs are\nrestricted to buying and selling the reference\nassets, and the risks/benefits of any such\nassets owned by the VIEs are passed to the\nthird-party clients via the TRS contracts.

Derivative\nFinancial Instruments.\u201d\n\nPledged Assets\n\nCertain assets were pledged to secure\nmunicipal deposits, securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, certain derivative\nagreements, and borrowings or borrowing\ncapacity, as well as to fund certain\nobligations related to nonqualified defined\nbenefit and defined contribution retirement\nplans and for other purposes as required or\npermitted by law. Assets pledged to the FHLB\nand FRB are subject to applicable asset\ndiscounts when determining borrowing capacity.\nThe Company has capacity for secured financing\nfrom both the FRB and FHLB and letters of\ncredit from the FHLB. The Company\u2019s letters of\ncredit from the FHLB can be used to secure\nvarious client deposits, including public fund\nrelationships. Excluding assets related to\nnonqualified benefit plans, the majority of\nthe agreements governing the pledged assets do\nnot permit the other party to sell or repledge\nthe collateral.

Our legal\nproceedings and other matters exist in varying\nstages of adjudication, arbitration,\nnegotiation, or investigation and span our\nbusiness lines and operations.\n\nThe course and outcome of legal proceedings\nand other matters are inherently\nunpredictable. This is especially so when a\nmatter is still in its early stages, the\ndamages sought are indeterminate or\nunsupported, significant facts are unclear or\ndisputed, novel questions of law or other\nmeaningful legal uncertainties exist, a\nrequest to certify a proceeding as a class\naction is outstanding or granted, multiple\nparties are named, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental entities are involved. As a\nresult, we often are unable to determine how\nor when actual or threatened legal proceedings\nand other matters will be resolved and what\nlosses may be incrementally and ultimately\nincurred. It is possible that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters, including those\ndescribed below, if unfavorable, may be\nmaterial to the consolidated financial\nposition, consolidated results of operations,\nor consolidated cash flows of Truist, or cause\nsignificant reputational consequences.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 35\nTruist establishes accruals for legal\nproceedings and other matters when potential\nlosses become probable and the amount of loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. Accruals are\nevaluated each quarter and may be adjusted,\nupward or downward, based on our best judgment\nafter consultation with counsel and others. No\nassurance exists that our accruals will not\nneed to be adjusted in the future. Actual\nlosses may be higher or lower than any amounts\naccrued, possibly to a significant degree.\n\nThe Company estimates reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of amounts accrued, of up to\napproximately $ 375million as of June 30,\n2024. This estimate does not represent\nTruist\u2019s maximum loss exposure, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Also, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be one that\nthe Company did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Company judged the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. In\naddition, the matters underlying this estimate\nmay change from time to time. Estimated\nlosses, like accruals, are based upon\ncurrently available information and involve\nconsiderable uncertainties and judgment.\n\nFor certain matters, Truist may be unable to\nestimate the loss or range of loss, even if it\nbelieves that a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, until developments in the matter\nprovide additional information sufficient to\nsupport such an estimate. These matters are\nnot accrued for and are not reflected in the\nestimate of reasonably possible losses.\n\nThe following is a description of certain\nlegal proceedings and other matters in which\nTruist is involved:\n\nBickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank\n\nThis class action case was filed in Fulton\nCounty State Court on July 12, 2010, and an\namended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010.\nPlaintiff alleges that all overdraft fees\ncharged to his account which related to debit\ncard and ATM transactions are actually\ninterest charges and therefore subject to the\nusury laws of Georgia. The amended complaint\nasserts claims for violations of civil and\ncriminal usury laws, conversion, and money had\nand received, and seeks damages on a class-\nwide basis, including refunds of challenged\noverdraft fees and pre-judgment interest. On\nOctober 6, 2017, the trial court granted\nplaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and\ndefined the class as \u201cEvery Georgia citizen\nwho had or has one or more accounts with\nSunTrust Bank and who, from July 12, 2006, to\nOctober 6, 2017 (i) had at least one overdraft\nof $500.00 or less resulting from an ATM or\ndebit card transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d);\n(ii) paid any Overdraft Fees as a result of\nthe Transaction; and (iii) did not receive a\nrefund of those Fees,\u201d and the granting of a\ncertified class was affirmed on appeal. The\nclass seeks a return of up to $ 452million in\npaid overdraft fees from the 2006 to 2017\nperiod above, plus prejudgment interest which,\nbased on the amount of claimed fees, was\nestimated to be approximately $ 415million as\nof June 30, 2024. A court-ordered mediation\nwas held on February 28, 2024, but no\nresolution was reached. On March 4, 2024, the\ntrial court issued an order granting in part\nand denying in part Truist\u2019s motions to amend\nthe class definition to narrow the scope of\nthe class, to compel arbitration against\ncertain class members, and for summary\njudgment. Truist and the class have separately\nappealed the trial court\u2019s order to the\nGeorgia Court of Appeals.\n\nRecordkeeping Matters\n\nThe SEC and CFTC have requested information\nfrom various subsidiaries of the Company that\nconduct broker-dealer, investment adviser, and\nswap dealer activities regarding compliance\nwith applicable recordkeeping requirements for\nbusiness-related electronic communications.\nThe Company has cooperated with these requests\nand is in advanced discussions regarding\nresolutions of these matters with the\nagencies, though there can be no assurance as\nto the outcome of these discussions.\n\nInvestigation Regarding Trusts\n\nIn 2016 and 2018, the Civil Division of the\nU.S. DOJ issued subpoenas to a corporate\npredecessor of Truist Bank under the Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement\nAct. These subpoenas requested documents and\nother information related to specified trusts\nfor which Truist Bank serves as trustee.\nTruist Bank is continuing to cooperate in the\ninvestigation and is in discussions regarding\nresolution of this matter, though there can be\nno assurance as to the outcome of these\ndiscussions.\n\nFDIC Special Assessment\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule\nto implement a special assessment to recoup\nlosses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in the first half of 2023. The\nassessment is based on an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022. The special\nassessment for Truist is $ 595million, with $\n507million recognized in the fourth quarter of\n2023 and additional adjustments of $ 75million\nand $ 13million recognized in the first and\nsecond quarters of 2024, respectively, due to\nincreases in the estimated relevant losses to\nthe DIF reported by the FDIC. In June 2024,\nthe FDIC provided notification that the\ncollection period will be extended an\nadditional two quarters beyond the initial\neight quarterly installments. The special\nassessment will be paid in ten quarterly\ninstallments beginning in the second quarter\nof 2024. The ultimate amount of expenses\nassociated with the special assessment will\nalso be impacted by the finalization of the\nlosses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions\nof Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,\nwhich could result in additional expense.\n\n36 Truist Financial Corporation\n                                              \n  NOTE 15.

Derivative Financial\nInstruments\u201d for additional discussion on\nnetting adjustments.\n\nAt June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\ninvestments totaling $ 483million and $\n459million, respectively, have been excluded\nfrom the table above as they are valued based\non net asset value as a practical expedient.\nThese investments primarily consist of certain\nSBIC funds.\n\nThe following discussion focuses on the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nfor brokered time deposit liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques and significant inputs for Level 2\nand Level 3 assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis,\nsee \u201cNote 18. Fair Value Disclosures\u201d of the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\nBrokered time deposits : The Company has\nelected to measure certain CDs that contain\nembedded derivatives at fair value. This fair\nvalue election better aligns the economics of\nthe CDs with the Company\u2019s risk management\nstrategies. The Company elects, on an\ninstrument by instrument basis, whether a new\nissuance will be measured at fair value. The\nCompany has classified CDs measured at fair\nvalue as level 2 instruments due to the\nCompany\u2019s ability to observe all significant\ninputs to model-derived valuations in active\nmarkets. The Company employs a discounted cash\nflow approach based on observable market\ninterest rates for the term of the CD and an\nestimate of the Bank\u2019s credit risk. For any\nembedded derivative features, the Company uses\nthe same valuation methodologies as if the\nderivative were a standalone derivative, as\ndiscussed in the \u201cDerivative assets and\nliabilities\u201d section in \u201cNote 18.

The remainder of\nLHFS is carried at fair value.\n\nLoans and leases consist of larger commercial\nloans and leases that are collateral-dependent\nand other secured loans and leases that have\nbeen charged-off to the fair value of the\ncollateral.

Partnership\ninvestments are measured based on discounted\nexpected future cash flows. The remaining\nassets are measured at LOCOM, less costs to\nsell.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair\nValue\n\nFor financial instruments not recorded at fair\nvalue, estimates of fair value are based on\nrelevant market data and information about the\ninstruments. Values obtained relate to trading\nwithout regard to any premium or discount that\nmay result from concentrations of ownership,\npossible tax ramifications, estimated\ntransaction costs that may result from bulk\nsales, or the relationship between various\ninstruments.\n\nAn active market does not exist for certain\nfinancial instruments. Fair value estimates\nfor these instruments are based on current\neconomic conditions and interest rate risk\ncharacteristics, loss experience, and other\nfactors. Many of these estimates involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant\njudgment and cannot be determined with\nprecision.

Company\u2019s corporate and\ninvestment banking business, the Company\nenters into contracts that are, in form or\nsubstance, written guarantees; specifically,\nrisk participations, TRS, and credit default\nswaps. The Company accounts for these\ncontracts as derivatives.\n\nTruist has entered into risk participation\nagreements to share the credit exposure with\nother financial institutions on client-related\ninterest rate derivative contracts. Under\nthese agreements, the Company has guaranteed\npayment to a dealer counterparty in the event\nthe counterparty experiences a loss on the\nderivative due to a failure to pay by the\ncounterparty\u2019s client. The Company manages its\npayment risk on its risk participations by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the\nunderlying client through the normal credit\nreview process that the Company would have\nperformed had it entered into a derivative\ndirectly with the obligors. At June 30, 2024,\nthe remaining terms on these risk\nparticipations ranged from less than one\nyearto 13years. The potential future exposure\nrepresents the Company\u2019s maximum estimated\nexposure to written risk participations, as\nmeasured by projecting a maximum value of the\nguaranteed derivative instruments based on\nscenario simulations and assuming 100% default\nby all obligors on the maximum value.\n\nThe Company has also entered into TRS\ncontracts on loans and bonds. To mitigate its\ncredit risk, the Company typically receives\ninitial margin from the counterparty upon\nentering into the TRS and variation margin if\nthe fair value of the underlying reference\nassets deteriorates. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s TRS contracts,\nsee \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe Company enters into credit default swaps\nto hedge credit risk associated with certain\nloans and leases. The Company accounts for\nthese contracts as derivatives, and\naccordingly, recognizes these contracts at\nfair value.\nThe following table presents additional\ninformation related to interest

                              \n  NOTE 18. Operating Segments                 \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment.\n\nFollowing the segment realignment, Truist\noperates and measures business activity across\ntwosegments: CSBB and WB, with functional\nactivities included in OT&C. The Company\u2019s\nbusiness segment structure is based on the\nmanner in which financial information is\nevaluated by management as well as the\nproducts and services provided or the type of\nclient served.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group,\nrepresenting substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s IH segment, which represented a\nmaterial strategic shift for the Company, and\nas a result, the Company recast results for\nall periods presented under the discontinued\noperations basis of presentation. On May 6,\n2024, the Company completed the sale of its\nremaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the\nprincipal legal entity of the IH segment. As\nthe operations of TIH were included in\ndiscontinued operations prior to the sale of\nTIH, the Company no longer presents the IH\nsegment as one of its reportable segments.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information related to discontinued\noperations.\n\nConsumer and Small Business Banking\n\nCSBB serves consumer and small business\nclients, providing deposits and payment\nservices, credit cards, loans, and mortgages\nthrough an extensive network of branches,\nATMs, digital channels, contact centers, and\nother channels. Lending solutions include\npersonal and unsecured loans originated\nthrough the branch network and digital\nchannels; indirect lending services providing\na comprehensive set of technology-enabled\nconsumer lending solutions including point-of-\nsale offerings for autos, recreational\nvehicles, outdoor power sports, equipment, and\nhome improvement; and real estate lending\nproviding residential mortgages through its\nretail, direct, and correspondent channels,\nwith the loans either sold in the secondary\nmarket, typically with servicing rights\nretained, or held in the Company\u2019s loan\nportfolio, and home equity loans delivered\nthrough the branch network. CSBB also serves\nas an entry point for clients to access\nservices from other businesses.\n\nWholesale Banking\n\nWB segment delivers a comprehensive suite of\ntailored solutions with specialized product\nand industry expertise delivered through local\ncoverage of corporate, commercial, and real\nestate clients combined with national coverage\nfrom investment banking and commercial real\nestate businesses. This segment is focused on\nproviding core banking, cash management,\npayments, specialized lending, investment\nbanking, capital markets, strategic advisory,\nand market-making. In addition to the services\nprovided by Truist\u2019s SEC registered investment\nadvisors, Truist\u2019s wealth professionals\nprovide asset management, trust, brokerage,\nand investment-related services, institutional\ninvestment management, full-service, and\nonline/discount brokerage products, family\noffice services, as well as other wealth\nmanagement disciplines.\n\n46 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nOther, Treasury & Corporate\n\nOT&C includes management of the Company\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio, long-term\ndebt, derivative instruments used for balance\nsheet hedging, short-term liquidity and\nfunding activities, balance sheet risk\nmanagement and most real estate assets, as\nwell as the Company\u2019s functional activities\nsuch as finance, enterprise risk, legal, and\nenterprise technology and management, among\nothers. Additionally, OT&C houses intercompany\neliminations, including intersegment net\nreferral fees and residual interest rate risk.\n\nTruist promotes revenue growth through the\nCompany\u2019s Integrated Relationship Management\napproach, which is designed to deepen client\nrelationships and bring the full breadth and\ndepth of Truist\u2019s products and services to\nmeet clients\u2019 financial needs. The objective\nis to provide Truist\u2019s entire suite of\nproducts to its clients with the end goal of\nproviding clients the best financial\nexperience in the marketplace. Revenues of\ncertain products and services are reflected in\nthe results of the segment providing those\nproducts and services and are also allocated\nto CSBB and WB. These allocated revenues\nbetween segments are reflected as net referral\nfees in noninterest income and eliminated in\nOT&C.\n\nThe segment results are presented based on\ninternal management methodologies that were\ndesigned to support these strategic\nobjectives. Unlike financial accounting, there\nis no comprehensive authoritative body of\nguidance for management accounting equivalent\nto GAAP. The performance of the segments is\nnot comparable with Truist\u2019s consolidated\nresults or with similar information presented\nby any other financial institution.\nAdditionally, because of the\ninterrelationships between the various\nsegments, the information presented is not\nindicative of how the segments would perform\nif they operated as independent entities.\n\nBecause business segment results are presented\nbased on management accounting practices, the\ntransition to the consolidated results\nprepared under U.S. GAAP creates certain\ndifferences, which are reflected as residuals\nin OT&C. Business segment reporting\nconventions include, but are not limited to,\nthe items as detailed below.\n\nSegment net interest income reflects matched\nmaturity funds transfer pricing, which\nascribes credits or charges based on the\neconomic value or cost created by assets and\nliabilities of each segment. Residual\ndifferences between these credits and charges\nare captured in OT&C.\n\nNoninterest income includes inter-segment\nreferral fees, as well as federal and state\ntax credits that are grossed up on a pre-tax\nequivalent basis, related primarily to certain\ncommunity development investments. Recoveries\nfor these allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nCorporate expense allocations, including\noverhead or functional expenses that are not\ndirectly charged to the segments, are\nallocated to segments based on various drivers\n(number of FTEs, number of accounts, loan\nbalances, net revenue, etc.). Recoveries for\nthese allocations are reported in OT&C.\n\nProvision for credit losses represents net\ncharge-offs by segment combined with an\nallocation to the segments for the provision\nattributable to each segment\u2019s quarterly\nchange in the ALLL. Provision for income taxes\nis calculated using a blended income tax rate\nfor each segment and includes reversals of the\nnoninterest income tax adjustments described\nabove. The difference between the calculated\nprovision for income taxes at the segment\nlevel and the consolidated provision for\nincome taxes is reported in OT&C.\n\nThe application and development of management\nreporting methodologies is an active process\nand undergoes periodic enhancements. The\nimplementation of these enhancements to the\ninternal management reporting methodology may\nmaterially affect the results disclosed for\neach segment, with no impact on consolidated\nresults. When significant changes to\nmanagement reporting methodologies take place,\nthe impact of these changes is quantified and\nprior period information is revised as\npracticable.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 47\nThe following table presents results by\nsegment:\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n(1) Includes financial data from business\nunits below the quantitative and qualitative\nthresholds requiring disclosure.\n48 Truist Financial Corporation\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  ITEM 2.

We are also subject to direct\nsupervision and periodic examinations by\nvarious governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations that are charged with\noverseeing the kinds of business activities in\nwhich we engage. The regulatory and\nsupervisory framework applicable to banking\norganizations is intended primarily for the\nprotection of depositors and other customers,\nthe DIF, the broader economy, and the\nstability of the U.S. financial system, rather\nthan for the protection of shareholders and\nnon-deposit creditors. In addition to banking\nlaws and regulations, Truist is subject to\nvarious other laws and regulations, all of\nwhich directly or indirectly affect the\noperations and management of Truist and its\nability to make distributions to shareholders.\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nupdates to significant federal and state laws\nto which Truist is subject since the filing of\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023. These descriptions do\nnot summarize all possible or proposed changes\nin laws or regulations and are not intended to\nbe a substitute for the related statutes or\nregulatory provisions. Refer to \u201cRegulatory\nand Supervisory Considerations\u201d in Truist\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for additional disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule\nto implement a special assessment to recoup\nlosses to the DIF associated with bank\nfailures in the first half of 2023. The\nassessment is based on an insured depository\ninstitution\u2019s estimated uninsured deposits\nreported as of December 31, 2022. The special\nassessment for Truist is $595 million, with\n$507 million recognized in the fourth quarter\nof 2023 and additional adjustments of $75\nmillion and $13 million recognized in the\nfirst and second quarters of 2024,\nrespectively, due to increases in the\nestimated relevant losses to the DIF reported\nby the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided\nnotification that the collection period will\nbe extended an additional two quarters beyond\nthe initial eight quarterly installments. The\nspecial assessment will be paid in ten\nquarterly installments beginning in the second\nquarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank, which could result in\nadditional expense.\n\nIn March 2024, the FDIC released proposed\nrevisions to its statement of policy on bank\nmerger transactions. The proposal reflects\nregulatory, legislative, and industry changes\nsince the statement of policy was last\npublished for comment and amended, makes the\nstatement more principles-based, communicates\nthe FDIC Board\u2019s expectations regarding the\nevaluation of merger applications filed under\nthe Bank Merger Act, and describes the types\nof merger applications for which the FDIC is\nthe responsible agency. Also, in July 2024,\nthe FDIC released a proposed rule to amend its\nregulations under the Change in Bank Control\nAct, which generally provides that no person\nmay directly or indirectly acquire control of\nan insured depository institution unless the\nperson has given the appropriate federal\nbanking agency prior notice of the proposed\ntransaction and the agency has not disapproved\nit. The FDIC\u2019s regulations contain a\nrebuttable presumption that the acquisition of\nvoting securities of a holding company like\nTruist that directly or indirectly controls an\ninsured state nonmember bank like Truist Bank\nconstitutes such an acquisition of control\nrequiring prior notice to the FDIC if,\nimmediately after the transaction, the\nacquiring person will own, control, or hold\nwith power to vote 10 percent or more of any\nclass of voting securities of the holding\ncompany and other specified conditions are\nmet. The proposed rule removes an explicit\nexemption for transactions where the FRB\nreviews a notice under the Change in Bank\nControl Act. In addition, the FDIC seeks\ninformation and comment about its approach in\nresponse to these notices, including the role\nplayed by asset managers and other\ninstitutional investors with FDIC-supervised\ninstitutions. We continue to evaluate both\nproposals and the potential impacts, if\nadopted as proposed, on the Company and Truist\nBank.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s capital plan rule provides that a\nBHC must update and resubmit its capital plan\nif the BHC determines there has been or will\nbe a material change in its risk profile,\nfinancial condition, or corporate structure\nsince it last submitted the capital plan.\nTruist determined that the sale of our\nremaining equity interests in TIH constituted\nsuch a material change and, therefore,\naddressed the material change in our capital\nplan submitted in April 2024. The capital plan\nrule further provides that, upon the\noccurrence of an event requiring resubmission\nand pending the FRB\u2019s consideration of the\nresubmitted capital plan, a BHC may not make\nany capital distribution unless it has\nreceived prior approval of the FRB. In July\n2024, the FRB notified Truist that the FRB\u2019s\nprior approval was no longer required to make\ncapital distributions in connection with the\nApril 2024 capital plan.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 49\nIn June 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to\nsignificantly modify the required frequency\nand informational content of resolution plan\nsubmissions applicable to insured depository\ninstitutions with $50 billion or more in total\nassets. As a covered insured depository\ninstitution in group A under the rule, Truist\nBank must develop an identified strategy for\nits resolution that is adaptable across a\nrange of possible failure scenarios. The rule\nalso introduces a new credibility standard for\nevaluating the adequacy of resolution plan\nsubmissions. The contours of the FDIC\u2019s\napplication of this new credibility standard\nremain to be seen and may require the exercise\nof a meaningful degree of judgment by the\nFDIC. A failure by Truist Bank to satisfy the\ncredibility standard, or any other provision\nof the rule, may cause the FDIC to require\nTruist Bank to reconsider portions of its\nresolution plan or result in an enforcement\naction by the FDIC. Truist Bank will be\nrequired to submit to the FDIC full resolution\nplans every three years and interim targeted\ninformation between full resolution plan\nsubmissions. The final rule is effective\nOctober 1, 2024, and the first full resolution\nplan submission by Truist Bank will be due no\nsooner than 270 days after the effective date.\n\nIn August 2024, the FDIC and the FRB issued\nfinal joint guidance regarding resolution\nplans submitted by large bank holding\ncompanies. Truist, as a domestic triennial\nfull filer under the rule, is required to\nsubmit a resolution plan every three years,\nbeginning on October 1, 2025, which reflects\nthe characteristics of the firm and its\nbusiness operations and supports the goal of\nsubstantially mitigating serious adverse\neffects on the financial stability of the\nUnited States in the event of the firm\u2019s\nfailure. The agencies have not yet finalized a\nrule requiring large bank holding companies to\nissue long-term debt that would serve as pre-\npositioned resolution resources in the event\nof a firm\u2019s failure. The long-term debt rule,\nwhen finalized, may have an impact on Truist\u2019s\nresolution plan strategy which may result in\nrevisions to its resolution plan submission.\n                                              \n  Executive Overview                          \n                                              \nIn the second quarter, we continued to see\nsolid momentum in our core banking businesses\nas evidenced by strong year-over-year growth\nin investment banking and trading revenue and\ncontinued expense discipline. Client deposits\nstabilized, and asset quality metrics remained\nwithin our expectations. While loan demand\nremained muted, we were encouraged by an\nimprovement in our dialogue with clients and\nour expanded capacity to support their needs.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, we completed the divestiture\nof TIH. We utilized a portion of the capital\ncreated from the sale of TIH to reposition our\nbalance sheet, which is expected to replace\nTIH\u2019s earnings contribution, create additional\nliquidity, and improve our interest rate risk\nprofile. These actions along with organic\ncapital generation resulted in an increase to\nour CET1 capital ratio to 11.6%. Financial\ninformation attributed to TIH has been\nreflected in discontinued operations for the\nperiods presented within and, unless otherwise\nstated, the following discussion excludes\namounts reported as discontinued operations.\nRefer to \u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information.\n\nThe sale of TIH resulted in after-tax cash\nproceeds to Truist of approximately $10.1\nbillion, reflecting certain closing\nadjustments for cash, debt and debt-like\nitems, including the settlement of certain\npreviously granted TIH equity awards, working\ncapital, transaction expenses and an investor\nreturn amount associated with the originally\nsold 20% stake. Upon closing, the transaction\nresulted in the deconsolidation of the TIH\nsubsidiary from Truist and resulted in an\napproximate after-tax gain of $4.8 billion.\nAdditionally, following the sale, Truist\nretained the related postretirement benefit\nobligation for TIH employees, and remeasured\nthe postretirement benefit obligation of the\nplan in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to\n\u201cNote 2. Discontinued Operations\u201d for\nadditional information related to discontinued\noperations and \u201cNote 13. Benefit Plans\u201d for\nadditional information related to the\npostretirement benefit obligation\nremeasurement.\n\nFollowing the sale of TIH, Truist executed a\nstrategic balance sheet repositioning of a\nportion of its AFS investment securities\nportfolio by selling $27.7 billion of lower-\nyielding investment securities, resulting in\nan after-tax loss of $5.1 billion in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. The investment\nsecurities that were sold had a book value of\n$34.4 billion and a weighted average book\nyield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024\nincluding the impact of hedges and based on\nthe Federal Funds futures curve at the time.\nIncluding the tax benefit, the repositioning\ngenerated $29.3 billion available for\nreinvestment.\n\nTruist invested approximately $18.7 billion of\nthe $39.4 billion generated from the sale of\nTIH and the balance sheet repositioning in\nshorter duration investment securities\nyielding 5.27%. The remaining $20.7 billion\nwas invested in cash. The blended reinvestment\nrate on the new investment securities\npurchased and cash is 5.22% for the remainder\nof 2024 including the impact of hedges and\nbased on the Federal Funds futures curve at\nthe time.\n\nOur Board authorized the repurchase of up to\n$5 billion of common stock beginning in the\nthird quarter of 2024 through the end of 2026.\nThe most recent FRB stress test highlighted\nour ability to weather a variety of stressed\neconomic scenarios.\n\nWe believe that Truist's strengthened capital\nposition offers us the opportunity to grow our\ncore banking franchise, while also prudently\nreturning capital to our shareholders through\nour strong dividend and recently announced\nshare repurchase program.\n\n50 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nFollowing the departure of our CIO in April\n2024, we have appointed an interim CIO while\nour search for a permanent CIO continues. Our\ninterim CIO has 20 years of banking experience\nacross risk management, commercial, consumer,\noperations, technology, and vertically\nintegrated businesses. He oversees the\nprovision of comprehensive technology, data,\nsecurity, and information related platforms.\n\nIn August 2024, the Company announced the\nhiring of a new CIO who will join the Company\nin the fourth quarter of 2024 and will lead\nthe enterprise technology team. The new CIO\nhas over 25 years of experience across a range\nof technology roles, primarily in the\nfinancial services industry.\n\nIn July 2024, we successfully completed the\nsale of Sterling Capital Management LLC, a\nWealth business.

Net interest\nmargin was 3.03%, up 13 basis points.\n\u2022 The yield on the average total loan\nportfolio was 6.44%, up 37 basis points,\nreflecting higher market interest rates, and\nthe yield on the average securities portfolio\nwas 2.77%, up 60 basis points, reflecting the\nbalance sheet repositioning and higher market\ninterest rates.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of total deposits was\n2.09%, up 56 basis points. The average cost of\nshort-term borrowings was 5.58%, up 39 basis\npoints. The average cost of long-term debt was\n4.87%, up 25 basis points. The increase in\nrates on deposits and other funding sources\nwas largely attributable to the higher rate\nenvironment.\n\nNoninterest income was down $6.6 billion\ncompared to the second quarter of 2023\nprimarily due to $6.7 billion of securities\nlosses resulting from the balance sheet\nrepositioning and lower other income,\npartially offset by higher investment banking\nand trading income and wealth management\nincome. Excluding securities losses,\nnoninterest income was up $58 million compared\nto the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNoninterest expense was up $48 million, or\n1.6%, compared to the second quarter of 2023\ndue to a $150 million charitable contribution\nto the Truist Foundation (other expense) and\nthe FDIC special assessment adjustment in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 of $13 million\n(regulatory costs), partially offset by lower\npersonnel expense. Adjusted noninterest\nexpense, which excludes the charitable\ncontribution, the FDIC special assessment\nadjustment, restructuring charges, the\namortization of intangibles, and a small loss\non the early extinguishment of debt in 2023,\ndecreased $86 million, or 3.0%, compared to\nthe earlier quarter.\n\nThe higher effective tax rate in the current\nquarter compared to the second quarter of 2023\nis due to a tax benefit on the pre-tax loss,\nwhich is driven by the discrete impact of the\nbalance sheet repositioning of securities.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 51\nAsset quality remained solid during the second\nquarter of 2024.\n\n\u2022 Nonperforming loans and leases held for\ninvestment were 0.46% of loans and leases held\nfor investment at June 30, 2024, up one basis\npoint compared to March 31, 2024.\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses was $5.1\nbillion and includes $4.8 billion for the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and $302\nmillion for the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments.

Additionally, the second quarter of\n2023 included $98 million of charge-offs\nrelated to the sale of the student loan\nportfolio.\n\nCapital ratios were significantly strengthened\nduring the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\u2022 Truist\u2019s CET1 ratio was 11.6% as of June 30,\n2024, up 150 basis points compared to March\n31, 2024 due to the sale of TIH and organic\ncapital generation, partially offset by the\nbalance sheet repositioning.\n\n\u2022 Truist's board of directors authorized a $5\nbillion share repurchase program beginning in\nthe third quarter of 2024 through 2026 as part\nof the Company's overall capital distribution\nstrategy.\n\n\u2022 Truist completed the 2024 CCAR process and\nreceived a preliminary SCB requirement of 2.8%\nfor the period October 1, 2024 to September\n30, 2025, down 10 basis points from the SCB\nrequirement for the period October 1, 2023 to\nSeptember 30, 2024.

First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company entered into\nan agreement to sell the remaining stake of\nthe common equity in TIH to an investor group,\nrepresenting substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s IH segment, which represented a\nmaterial strategic shift for the Company, and\nas a result, the Company recast results for\nall periods presented under the discontinued\noperations basis of presentation. On May 6,\n2024, the Company completed the sale of its\nremaining equity interests in TIH. TIH was the\nprincipal legal entity of the IH segment.

Interest rate risk results from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes\nand the timing of cash flows associated with\nassets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from\nchanging rate relationships among different\nyield curves affecting bank activities (basis\nrisk); from changing rate relationships across\nthe spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);\nand from interest-related options inherently\nembedded in bank products (options risk).\n\nThe primary objectives of effective market\nrisk management are to minimize adverse\neffects from changes in market risk factors on\nnet interest income, net income, and capital,\nand to offset the risk of price changes for\ncertain assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. At Truist, market risk management\nalso includes the enterprise-wide IPV\nfunction.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Market Risk                   \n                                              \nAs a financial institution, Truist is exposed\nto interest rate risk from assets,\nliabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.\nTruist primarily monitors this risk through\ntwo measurement types, (i) NII at risk and\n(ii) economic value of equity, and manages\nthis risk with securities, derivatives, and\nbroader asset liability management activities.\n\nIRR measurement is reported monthly through\nthe ALCO. Monthly IRR reporting includes\nexposure and historical trends relative to\nrisk limit scenarios, impacts to a wide range\nof rate scenarios, and sensitivity tests of\nkey assumptions. IRR reporting is provided to\nthe BRC monthly and reviews of varying IRR\ntopics are performed quarterly.\n\n70 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nIRR measurement is influenced by data,\nassumptions, and models. Due to their high\nsensitivity to market rates, mortgage (loan\nand security) prepayments leverage an industry\nmodel that results in varying prepayment\nspeeds across rate scenarios. Prepayments for\nnon-mortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic\nmodels and static prepayment assumptions based\non historical experience. Interest-bearing-\ndeposit rate paid is projected to move at a\nratio (deposit beta) of market rates,\nprimarily the Federal Funds Rate, aligned to\nhistorical experience.\n\nTruist uses derivatives to hedge interest\nincome variability of floating rate loans and\nto hedge valuation changes of long-term debt\nand investment securities.\n\nNII at risk measures the change in NII under\nalternate interest rate scenarios relative to\nTruist\u2019s baseline scenario, which incorporates\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges as well as expectations for new\nbusiness over the forecast horizon. Truist\u2019s\nbaseline scenario relies on assumptions\nincluding expectations of the economy and\ninterest rates \u2013 which are influenced by\nmarket conditions, new business volume,\npricing, and customer behavior. In measuring\nNII at risk, Truist assumes that changes in\nkey factors, such as prepayments and deposit\npricing (betas), largely move in line with\nthose it has experienced in prior rate cycles.\nHowever, future behavior of key factors may\nvary from those used in this measurement. NII\nat risk measurement assumes, when applicable,\nthat U.S. interest rates floor at zero and\nTruist does not take any balance sheet or\nhedging actions in response to the rate\nscenarios.\n\nTruist evaluates a wide range of alternate\nscenarios including instantaneous and gradual\nas well as parallel and non-parallel changes\nin interest rates. The table below presents\nthe estimated change to NII over the following\n12 months for select parallel alternate\nscenarios, expressed as a percentage change\nrelative to baseline NII.\n                                              \n  Table 19:                                   \n  Interest                                    \n  Sensitiv\u2026                                   \n  Simulati\u2026       Jun 30,         Dec 31,     \n  Analysis           2024            2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Up 200bps                                   \n  gradual                                     \n  change in         -2.22  %        -1.46  %  \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Up 50bps                                    \n  instanta\u2026                                   \n  change in         -0.67           -0.36     \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Down                                        \n  50bps                                       \n  instanta\u2026          0.22           -0.10     \n  change in                                   \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n  Down                                        \n  200bps                                      \n  gradual            0.70           -0.30     \n  change in                                   \n  interest                                    \n  rates                                       \n                                              \nEstimated changes to NII in the table above\nassume no change in deposit balances or mix\nrelative to the baseline scenario. In\nincreasing interest rate scenarios, rotation\nfrom non-interest-bearing into interest\nbearing deposits would reduce NII. Conversely,\nin decreasing interest rate scenarios,\nrotation from higher yielding to lower\nyielding deposits would benefit net interest\nincome. Truist performs and monitors\nsensitivity tests of deposit and other key\nassumptions used in NII risk including:\n\n\u2022 Asset prepayment speeds\n\n\u2022 New loan volume pricing spreads\n\n\u2022 Interest-bearing deposit betas\n\n\u2022 Non-interest-bearing demand deposit balance\nrunoff, replaced by market funding\n\nEVE measures changes in the economic value of\nTruist\u2019s current balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios\nrelative to starting economic value. Truist\nuses EVE as a longer-term measure of interest\nrate risk. Truist performs and monitors\nsensitivity tests of key assumptions used in\nEVE including:\n\n\u2022 Asset prepayment speeds\n\n\u2022 Mortgage spreads (mortgage loan and security\nvaluations)\n\n\u2022 Interest-bearing deposit beta\n\n\u2022 Deposit runoff / decay\n\nKey assumption tests are generally performed\nby increasing and decreasing the assumption,\nwhether static or dynamically modeled,\nrelative to their respective starting values\nand then measuring the resulting impact to NII\nand EVE under baseline and alternate rate\nscenarios.\n\nThe identification and testing of key\nassumptions are influenced by market\nconditions and management views of key risks.\nThe results of key assumption sensitivity\ntests are reported to ALCO and BRC at least\nquarterly. The inventory of key assumptions\nand their associated sensitivity tests are\nreviewed with ALCO and BRC at least annually.\n                                              \n  Market Risk from Trading Activities         \n                                              \nAs a financial intermediary, Truist provides\nits clients access to derivatives, foreign\nexchange and securities markets, which\ngenerate market risks. Trading market risk is\nmanaged using a comprehensive risk management\napproach, which includes measuring risk using\nVaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.\nRisk metrics are monitored against a suite of\nlimits on a daily basis at both the trading\ndesk level and at the aggregate portfolio\nlevel.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 71\nTruist is also subject to risk-based capital\nguidelines for market risk under the Market\nRisk Rule.\n\nCovered Trading Positions\n\nCovered positions subject to the Market Risk\nRule include trading assets and liabilities,\nspecifically those held for the purpose of\nshort-term resale or with the intent of\nbenefiting from actual or expected short-term\nprice movements or to lock in arbitrage\nprofits. Truist\u2019s trading portfolio of covered\npositions results primarily from market making\nand underwriting services for the Company\u2019s\nclients, as well as associated risk mitigating\nhedging activity. The trading portfolio,\nmeasured in terms of VaR, consists primarily\nof four sub-portfolios of covered positions:\n(i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income\nsecurities, (iii) interest rate derivatives,\nand (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker\nacross different asset classes, Truist\u2019s\ntrading portfolio also contains other sub-\nportfolios, including foreign exchange, loan\ntrading, and commodity derivatives; however,\nthese portfolios do not generate material\ntrading risk exposures.\n\nValuation policies and methodologies exist for\nall trading positions. Additionally, these\npositions are subject to independent price\nverification. See \u201cNote 16. Derivative\nFinancial Instruments,\u201d \u201cNote 15. Fair Value\nDisclosures,\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting\nPolicies\u201d herein for discussion of valuation\npolicies and methodologies.\n\nSecuritizations\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the aggregate market\nvalue of on-balance sheet securitization\npositions subject to the Market Risk Rule,\nwhich were non-agency asset backed securities\npositions, was $96 million. Consistent with\nthe Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company\nperforms pre-purchase due diligence on each\nsecuritization position to identify the\ncharacteristics including, but not limited to,\ndeal structure and the asset quality of the\nunderlying assets, that materially affect\nvaluation and performance. Securitization\npositions are subject to Truist\u2019s\ncomprehensive risk management framework, which\nincludes daily monitoring against a suite of\nlimits. There were no off-balance sheet\nsecuritization positions during the reporting\nperiod.\n\nCorrelation Trading Positions\n\nThe trading portfolio of covered positions did\nnot contain any correlation trading positions\nas of June 30, 2024.\n\nVaR-Based Measures\n\nVaR measures the potential loss of a given\nposition or portfolio of positions at a\nspecified confidence level and time horizon.\nTruist utilizes a historical VaR methodology\nto measure and aggregate risks across its\ncovered trading positions. For risk management\npurposes, the VaR calculation is based on a\nhistorical simulation approach and measures\nthe potential trading losses using a one-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the\nCompany calculates VaR using a 10-day holding\nperiod and a 99% confidence level. Due to\ninherent limitations of the VaR methodology,\nsuch as the assumption that past market\nbehavior is indicative of future market\nperformance, VaR is only one of several tools\nused to measure and manage market risk. Other\ntools used to actively manage market risk\ninclude stress testing, scenario analysis, and\nstop loss limits.\n\n72 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe trading portfolio\u2019s VaR profile is\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, including\nthe size and composition of the portfolio,\nmarket volatility, and the correlation between\ndifferent positions. A portfolio of trading\npositions is typically less risky than the sum\nof the risk from each of the individual sub-\nportfolios, because, under normal market\nconditions, risk within each category\npartially offsets the exposure to other risk\ncategories. The following table summarizes\ncertain VaR-based measures for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \nStressed VaR-based measures\n\nStressed VaR, another component of market risk\ncapital, is calculated using the same internal\nmodels as used for the VaR-based measure.\nStressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day\nholding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence\nlevel and employs a historical simulation\napproach based on a continuous twelve-month\nhistorical window selected to reflect a period\nof significant financial stress for the\nCompany\u2019s trading portfolio.

The Market Risk Rule provides\nfixed risk weights under a standardized\nmeasurement method while also allowing a\nmodel-based approach, subject to regulatory\napproval. Truist utilizes the standardized\nmeasurement method to calculate the specific\nrisk component of market risk regulatory\ncapital. As such, incremental risk capital\nrequirements do not apply.\n\nVaR Model Backtesting\n\nIn accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the\nCompany evaluates the accuracy of its VaR\nmodel through daily backtesting by comparing\naggregate daily trading gains and losses\n(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income, and intraday trading) from\ncovered positions with the corresponding daily\nVaR-based measures generated by the model. As\nillustrated in the following graph, there were\nno Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions\nduring the twelve months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe total number of Company-wide VaR\nbacktesting exceptions over the preceding\ntwelve months is used to determine the\nmultiplication factor for the VaR-based\ncapital requirement under the Market Risk\nRule. The capital multiplication factor\nincreases from a minimum of three to a maximum\nof four, depending on the number of\nexceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting\nexceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the\ncontext of VaR model use and performance.\nThere was no change in the capital\nmultiplication factor over the preceding\ntwelve months.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 73\nModel Risk Oversight\n\nMRO is responsible for the independent model\nvalidation of all decision tools and models\nincluding trading market risk models. The\nvalidation activities are conducted in\naccordance with MRO policy, which incorporates\nregulatory guidance related to the evaluation\nof model conceptual soundness, ongoing\nmonitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of\nongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of\nall trading risk models is reviewed regularly\nto preemptively address emerging developments\nin financial markets, assess evolving modeling\napproaches, and identify potential model\nenhancement.\n\nStress Testing\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive range of\nstress testing techniques to help monitor\nrisks across trading desks and to augment\nstandard daily VaR and other risk limits\nreporting. The stress testing framework is\ndesigned to quantify the impact of extreme,\nbut plausible, stress scenarios that could\nlead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests\ninclude simulations for risk factor\nsensitivities, historical repeats, and\nhypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity\nhorizons of key risk factors. All trading\npositions within each applicable market risk\ncategory (interest rate risk, equity risk,\nforeign exchange rate risk, credit spread\nrisk, and commodity price risk) are included\nin the Company\u2019s comprehensive stress testing\nframework. Management reviews stress testing\nscenarios on an ongoing basis and makes\nupdates, as necessary, to capture both current\nand emerging risks. Management also utilizes\nstress analyses to support the Company\u2019s\ncapital adequacy assessment standards. See the\n\u201cCapital\u201d section of MD&A for additional\ndiscussion of capital adequacy.\n                                              \n  Liquidity                                   \n                                              \nLiquidity represents the continuing ability to\nmeet funding needs, including deposit\nwithdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other\nliabilities, and funding of loan commitments.\nIn addition to the level of liquid assets,\nsuch as cash, cash equivalents, and highly\nliquid unencumbered securities, other factors\naffect the ability to meet liquidity needs,\nincluding access to a variety of funding\nsources, maintaining borrowing capacity,\ngrowing core deposits, loan repayment, and the\nability to securitize or package loans for\nsale.\n\nTruist monitors the ability to meet client\ndemand for funds under both normal and\nstressed market conditions. In considering its\nliquidity position, management evaluates\nTruist\u2019s funding mix based on client core\nfunding, client rate-sensitive funding, and\nnational markets funding. In addition,\nmanagement evaluates exposure to rate-\nsensitive funding sources that mature in one\nyear or less. Management also measures\nliquidity needs for up to one-year of stressed\ncash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To\npromote a strong liquidity position and\ncompliance with regulatory requirements,\nmanagement maintains a liquid asset buffer of\ncash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered\nsecurities to meet projected 30 days of\nstressed cash outflows.\n\n74 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nInternal Liquidity Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is conducted for\nTruist and Truist Bank using a variety of\ninstitution-specific and market-wide adverse\nscenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario\napplies defined assumptions to execute sources\nand uses of liquidity over varying planning\nhorizons. The types of expected liquidity uses\nduring a stressed event may include, but are\nnot limited to, deposit attrition, contractual\nmaturities, reductions in unsecured and\nsecured funding, and increased draws on\nunfunded commitments. To mitigate liquidity\noutflows, Truist has identified sources of\nliquidity; however, access to these sources of\nliquidity could be affected within a stressed\nenvironment.\n\nTruist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on\nhand and highly liquid unencumbered securities\nthat is sufficient to meet the projected\n30-day net stressed cash-flow needs and\nmaintain compliance with regulatory\nrequirements. The liquidity buffer consists of\nunencumbered highly liquid assets and Truist\u2019s\nliquidity buffer is substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as HQLA under\nthe LCR Rule.\n\nContingency Funding Plan\n\nTruist has a contingency funding plan designed\nto address ongoing obligations and\ncommitments, particularly in the event of a\nliquidity contraction. This plan is designed\nto examine and quantify the organization\u2019s\nliquidity under the various internal liquidity\nstress scenarios and is periodically tested to\nassess the plan\u2019s reliability. Additionally,\nthe plan provides a framework for management\nand other teammates to follow in the event of\na liquidity contraction or in anticipation of\nsuch an event. The plan addresses authority\nfor activation and decision making, liquidity\noptions, and the responsibilities of key\ndepartments in the event of a liquidity\ncontraction.\n\nLCR, NSFR, and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that\nis sufficient to meet its estimated total net\ncash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for\npurposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational\nrequirements of the LCR rule. Truist and\nTruist Bank are subject to the Category III\nreduced LCR requirements. Truist held average\nweighted eligible HQLA of $81.0 billion and\nTruist\u2019s average LCR was 110% for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe NSFR rule requires that Truist and Truist\nBank maintain a minimum amount of stable,\nlong-term funding in relation to its asset\ncomposition and off-balance sheet activities.\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to the\nCategory III reduced NSFR requirements. At\nJune 30, 2024, Truist was compliant with this\nrequirement.\n\nSources of Funds\n\nManagement believes current sources of\nliquidity are sufficient to meet Truist\u2019s on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations. Truist\nfunds its balance sheet through diverse\nsources of funding including client deposits,\nsecured and unsecured capital markets funding,\nand shareholders\u2019 equity. Truist Bank\u2019s\nprimary source of funding is client deposits.\nContinued access to client deposits is highly\ndependent on public confidence in the\nstability of Truist Bank and its ability to\nreturn funds to clients when requested.\n\nTruist Bank maintains a number of diverse\nfunding sources to meet its liquidity\nrequirements. These sources include unsecured\nborrowings from the capital markets through\nthe issuance of senior or subordinated bank\nnotes, institutional CDs, overnight and term\nFederal funds markets, and retail brokered\nCDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to\nsecured borrowing sources including FHLB\nadvances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB\ndiscount window. Available investment\nsecurities could be pledged to create\nadditional secured borrowing capacity. The\nfollowing table presents a summary of Truist\nBank\u2019s available secured borrowing capacity\nand eligible cash at the FRB:\n                                              \n  Table 22:                                   \n  Selected                                    \n  Liquidity                                   \n  Sources                                     \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                 Jun 30,         Dec 31,  \n  millions)             2024            2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unused                                      \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity:                                   \n  FRB          $      63,142    $     55,252  \n  FHLB                32,892          24,712  \n  Available                                   \n  investme\u2026                                   \n  securiti\u2026           64,610          74,717  \n  (after                                      \n  haircuts)                                   \n  Available                                   \n  secured            160,644         154,681  \n  borrowing                                   \n  capacity                                    \n  Eligible                                    \n  cash at             35,548          25,085  \n  the FRB                                     \n  Total        $     196,192    $    179,766  \n                                              \nAt June 30, 2024, Truist Bank\u2019s available\nsecured borrowing capacity represented\napproximately 4.8 times the amount of\nwholesale funding maturities in one-year or\nless.\n               Truist Financial Corporation 75\nParent Company\n\nThe Parent Company serves as the primary\nsource of capital for the operating\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company\u2019s assets\nconsist primarily of cash on deposit with\nTruist Bank, equity investments in\nsubsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and\nnotes receivable from subsidiaries. The\nprincipal obligations of the Parent Company\nare payments on long-term debt. The main\nsources of funds for the Parent Company are\ndividends and management fees from\nsubsidiaries, repayments of advances to\nsubsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance\nof equity and long-term debt. The primary uses\nof funds by the Parent Company are investments\nin subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries,\ndividend payments to common and preferred\nshareholders, repurchases of common stock, and\npayments on and, from time-to-time, potential\nrepurchases or redemptions of a portion of an\noutstanding tranche of the long-term debt of\nthe Parent Company (as may be permitted by the\nterms of each respective series). See \u201cNote\n22. Parent Company Financial Information\u201d in\nTruist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 for additional\ninformation regarding dividends from\nsubsidiaries and debt transactions.\n\nAccess to funding at the Parent Company is\nmore sensitive to market disruptions.\nTherefore, Truist prudently manages cash\nlevels at the Parent Company to cover a\nminimum of one year of projected cash outflows\nwhich includes unfunded external commitments,\ndebt service, common and preferred dividends\nand scheduled debt maturities, without the\nbenefit of any new cash inflows from\nsubsidiary dividends to the Parent or capital\nmarket activity. Truist maintains a\nsignificant buffer above the projected one\nyear of cash outflows. In determining the\nbuffer, Truist considers cash requirements for\ncommon and preferred dividends, unfunded\ncommitments to affiliates, serving as a source\nof strength to Truist Bank, and being able to\nwithstand sustained market disruptions that\ncould limit access to the capital markets. At\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nParent Company had 54 months and 48 months,\nrespectively, of cash on hand to satisfy\nprojected cash outflows, and 32 months and 30\nmonths, respectively, when including the\npayment of common stock dividends.\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are forward-looking opinions of\nrating agencies as to the Company\u2019s ability to\nmeet its financial commitments and repay its\nsecurities and obligations in accordance with\ntheir terms of issuance. Credit ratings\ninfluence both borrowing costs and access to\nthe capital markets. The Company\u2019s credit\nratings are continuously monitored by the\nrating agencies and are subject to change at\nany time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, management meets with\nthe major rating agencies on a regular basis\nto provide financial and business updates and\nto discuss current outlooks and trends. See\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Truist\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for additional information\nregarding factors that influence credit\nratings and potential risks that could\nmaterialize in the event of downgrade in the\nCompany\u2019s credit ratings. Recent changes in\nthe Company\u2019s credit ratings and outlooks\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 On May 8, 2024, Moody\u2019s Ratings downgraded\nTruist's long-term senior unsecured rating to\nBaa1 from A3 and Truist Bank\u2019s baseline credit\nassessment to a3 from a2 and long-term\ndeposits rating to A1 from Aa3. In addition,\nTruist Bank\u2019s short-term deposit rating was\naffirmed at Prime-1. Ratings outlooks for both\nTruist and Truist Bank were changed to stable.\n                                              \n  Capital                                     \n                                              \nThe maintenance of appropriate levels of\ncapital is a management priority and is\nmonitored on a regular basis. Truist\u2019s\nprincipal goals related to the maintenance of\ncapital are to provide adequate capital to\nsupport Truist\u2019s risk profile consistent with\nthe Board-approved risk appetite, provide\nfinancial flexibility to support future growth\nand client needs, comply with relevant laws,\nregulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve\noptimal credit ratings for Truist and its\nsubsidiaries, remain a source of strength for\nits subsidiaries, and provide a competitive\nreturn to shareholders. Risk-based capital\nratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, and Total capital are calculated\nbased on regulatory guidance related to the\nmeasurement of capital and risk-weighted\nassets.\n\n76 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nTruist regularly performs stress testing on\nits capital levels and is required to\nperiodically submit the Company\u2019s capital\nplans and stress testing results to the\nbanking regulators. Management regularly\nmonitors the capital position of Truist on\nboth a consolidated and bank-level basis. In\nthis regard, management\u2019s objective is to\nmaintain capital at levels that are in excess\nof internal capital limits, which are above\nthe regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d minimums.\nManagement has implemented internal stress\ncapital ratio minimums to evaluate whether\ncapital ratios calculated after the effect of\nalternative capital actions are likely to\nremain above internal minimums. Breaches of\ninternal stressed minimums prompt a review of\nthe planned capital actions included in\nTruist\u2019s capital plan.\n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026                    \u2026     \n      \u2026                                 \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n                                        \u2026     \n              \u2026            \u2026                  \n                           \u2026                  \n      \u2026  %            \u2026         \u2026  %    \u2026  %  \n      \u2026            \u2026  %         \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026            \u2026            \u2026       \u2026     \n      \u2026               \u2026         \u2026          \u2026  \n      \u2026               \u2026            \u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.9%\napplicable to Truist as of June 30, 2024.\nTruist\u2019s SCB requirement, received in the 2023\nCCAR process, is effective from October 1,\n2023 to September 30, 2024. Under the 2024\nCCAR process, Truist was notified its\npreliminary SCB requirement would be 2.8% from\nOctober 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\n\nTruist completed the 2024 CCAR process and\nreceived a preliminary SCB requirement of 2.8%\nfor the period October 1, 2024 to September\n30, 2025, down 10 basis points from the SCB\nrequirement for the period October 1, 2023 to\nSeptember 30, 2024. The FRB will provide\nTruist with its final SCB requirement by\nAugust 31, 2024.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s capital plan rule provides that a\nBHC must update and resubmit its capital plan\nif the BHC determines there has been or will\nbe a material change in its risk profile,\nfinancial condition, or corporate structure\nsince it last submitted the capital plan.\nTruist determined that the sale of our\nremaining equity interests in TIH constitutes\nsuch a material change and, therefore,\naddressed the material change in our capital\nplan submitted in April 2024. The capital plan\nrule further provides that, upon the\noccurrence of an event requiring resubmission,\na BHC may not make any capital distribution\nunless it has received prior approval of the\nFRB pending the FRB's consideration of the\ncapital plan resubmission and stress capital\nbuffer requirement. In July 2024, the FRB\nnotified Truist that Truist is no longer\nrequired to receive the FRB\u2019s prior approval\nto make capital distributions in connection\nwith the April 2024 capital plan submission.\n\nTruist\u2019s capital ratios are presented in the\nfollowing table:\n                                              \n  Table                                       \n  24:                                         \n  Capital                                     \n  Ratios                                      \n  -                                           \n  Truist                                      \n  Financ\u2026                                     \n  Corpor\u2026                                     \n  (Dolla\u2026                                     \n  in             Jun 30,          Dec 31,     \n  millio\u2026           2024             2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk-b\u2026       -prelim\u2026                      \n  CET1              11.6  %          10.1  %  \n  Tier 1            13.2             11.6     \n  capital                                     \n  Total             15.4             13.7     \n  capital                                     \n  Levera\u2026           10.5              9.3     \n  ratio                                       \n  Supple\u2026                                     \n  levera\u2026            8.9              7.9     \n  ratio                                       \n  Risk-w\u2026    $   412,406       $  423,705     \n  assets                                      \n                                              \nCapital ratios significantly strengthened\ncompared to the regulatory requirements for\nwell capitalized banks.

Repurchased\nshares revert to the status of authorized and\nunissued shares upon repurchase. The share-\nrepurchase program enables Truist to acquire\nshares through open-market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including\nthrough Rule 10b5-1 plans and other programs,\nat the discretion of management and on terms\n(including quantity, timing, and price) that\nmanagement determines to be advisable. Actions\nin connection with the share-repurchase\nprogram will be subject to various factors,\nincluding Truist's capital and liquidity\npositions and related internal frameworks,\naccounting and regulatory considerations\n(including any restrictions that may be\nimposed by the FRB and any changes to capital,\nliquidity, and other regulatory requirements\nthat may be proposed or adopted by the U.S.\nbanking agencies), Truist's financial and\noperational performance, alternative uses of\ncapital, the trading price of Truist's common\nstock, and general market conditions. The\nshare-repurchase program does not obligate\nTruist to acquire a specific dollar amount or\nnumber of shares and may be extended,\nmodified, or discontinued at any time.\n                                              \n  Critical Accounting Policies                \n                                              \nThe accounting and reporting policies of\nTruist are in accordance with GAAP and conform\nto the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by bank regulatory authorities.\nTruist\u2019s financial position and results of\noperations are affected by management\u2019s\napplication of accounting policies, including\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments made to\narrive at the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities, and amounts reported for revenues\nand expenses. Different assumptions in the\napplication of these policies could result in\nmaterial changes in the consolidated financial\nposition and/or consolidated results of\noperations, and related disclosures. Material\nestimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination\nof the ACL; determination of fair value for\nsecurities, MSRs, LHFS, trading loans, and\nderivative assets and liabilities; goodwill\nand other intangible assets; income taxes; and\npension and postretirement benefit\nobligations. Understanding Truist\u2019s accounting\npolicies is fundamental to understanding the\nconsolidated financial position and\nconsolidated results of operations. The\ncritical accounting policies are discussed in\nMD&A in Truist\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSignificant accounting policies and changes in\naccounting principles and effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are discussed in\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDisclosures regarding the effects of new\naccounting pronouncements are included in\n\u201cNote 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d in this\nreport. There have been no other changes to\nthe critical accounting policies during 2024.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets        \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2024, several business\nactivities were realigned reflecting updates\nto the Company\u2019s operating structure. First,\nthe CB&W segment was renamed CSBB and the C&CB\nsegment was renamed WB. Second, the Wealth\nbusiness was realigned into the WB segment\nfrom the CSBB segment, representing a separate\nreporting unit in that segment. Third, the\nsmall business banking client segmentation was\nrealigned into the CSBB segment from the WB\nsegment. Further, TIH was the principal legal\nentity of the IH segment. As the operations of\nTIH were included in discontinued operations\nprior to the sale of TIH, the Company no\nlonger presents the IH segment as one of its\nreportable segments. Following these\nrealignments, the Company\u2019s three reporting\nunits with goodwill balances were CSBB, WB,\nand Wealth. Also in conjunction with these\nrealignments, goodwill of $1.7 billion was\nrealigned to WB from CSBB based on the\nrelative fair value of CSBB and Wealth, and\ngoodwill of $220 million was realigned to CSBB\nfrom WB based on the relative fair value of WB\nand the realigned small business banking\nclient segmentation. In addition, the Company\ncompleted an assessment of any potential\ngoodwill impairment for all impacted reporting\nunits immediately prior and subsequent to the\nreassignments and determined that no\nimpairment existed.\n\n78 Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThe quantitative valuations of these reporting\nunits for purposes of realigning goodwill use\nthe income approach and a market-based\napproach, each weighted at 50%. The inputs and\nassumptions specific to each reporting unit\nare incorporated in the valuations, including\nprojections of future cash flows, discount\nrates, and applicable valuation multiples\nbased on the comparable public company\ninformation. The income approach utilizes a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis of multi-year\nfinancial forecasts developed for each\nreporting unit by considering several inputs\nand assumptions such as net interest margin,\nexpected credit losses, noninterest income,\nnoninterest expense, and required capital. The\nmarket-based approach utilizes comparable\npublic company information, key valuation\nmultiples, and considers a market control\npremium associated with cost synergies and\nother cash flow benefits that arise from\nobtaining control over a reporting unit, and\nguideline transactions, when applicable.\n\nTruist also assesses the reasonableness of the\naggregate estimated fair value of the\nreporting units by comparison to its market\ncapitalization over a reasonable period of\ntime, including consideration of expected\nacquirer expense synergies, historic bank\ncontrol premiums, and the current market.\n\nThe projection of net interest margin and\nnoninterest expense are the most significant\ninputs to the financial projections of the\nCSBB, WB, and Wealth reporting units. The\nlong-term growth rate used in determining the\nterminal value of each reporting unit was 3%\nas of January 1, 2024, based on management\u2019s\nassessment of the minimum expected terminal\ngrowth rate of each reporting unit. Discount\nrates are estimated based on the Capital Asset\nPricing Model, which considers the risk-free\ninterest rate, market risk premium, beta, and\nunsystematic risk adjustments specific to a\nparticular reporting unit. The discount rates\nare also calibrated based on risks related to\nthe projected cash flows of each reporting\nunit. The discount rates utilized for the\nCSBB, WB and Wealth reporting units as of\nJanuary 1, 2024 were 13.0%, 11.5%, and 12.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nThe quantitative valuation of WB performed in\nconjunction with the goodwill realignments\nindicated that as of January 1, 2024, the fair\nvalue of the WB reporting unit exceeded its\ncarrying value by less than 10%, indicating\nthat the goodwill of the WB reporting unit may\nbe at risk of impairment. Circumstances that\ncould negatively impact the fair value for the\nWB reporting unit in the future include a\nsustained decrease in Truist\u2019s stock price, a\ndecline in industry peer multiples, an\nincrease in the applicable discount rate, and\ndeterioration in the reporting unit\u2019s\nforecast.\n\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit\nis highly sensitive to changes in management\u2019s\nestimates and assumptions; therefore, in some\ninstances, changes in these assumptions could\nimpact whether the fair value of a reporting\nunit is greater than its carrying value. The\nvaluation of the WB reporting unit as of\nJanuary 1, 2024 indicated that if the discount\nrate were increased less than 50 basis points,\nthe reporting unit\u2019s fair value would be less\nthan its carrying value, resulting in a\ngoodwill impairment. Ultimately, future\npotential changes in management\u2019s assumptions\nmay impact the estimated fair value of a\nreporting unit and cause the fair value of the\nreporting unit to be below its carrying value.\nAdditionally, a reporting unit\u2019s carrying\nvalue could change based on market conditions,\nchange in the underlying makeup of the\nreporting unit, or the risk profile of those\nreporting units, which could impact whether\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan carrying value.\n\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances\nduring the period from January 1, 2024 to June\n30, 2024, including macroeconomic and market\nfactors, industry and banking sector events,\nTruist specific performance indicators, a\ncomparison of management\u2019s forecast and\nassumptions to those used in its January 1,\n2024 quantitative valuations associated with\nthe realignments of goodwill, and the\nsensitivity of the January 1, 2024\nquantitative results to changes in assumptions\nas of June 30, 2024. Based on these\nconsiderations, Truist concluded that it was\nnot more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof one or more of its reporting units is below\nits respective carrying amount as of June 30,\n2024.\n                                              \n  Pension and Postretirement Benefit          \n  Obligations                                 \n                                              \nFollowing the sale of TIH, Truist retained the\npostretirement benefit obligation for TIH\nemployees and changed the status of TIH\nemployees by eliminating their eligibility to\nearn future service credits. Changes in\npension plan obligations associated with the\ndisposal of operating segments such as TIH\nrequire the remeasurement of postretirement\nbenefit obligations prior to the disposal,\nupdates to pension plan assumptions inherent\nin valuations, and identification and\nrecognition of valuation changes specific to\nthe sale, including the establishment of a new\nperiodic service cost using assumptions as of\nthe remeasurement date. The remeasurement\nprocess of impacted pension plans included a\nreduction in pension benefit obligations of\n$783 million, primarily driven by an increase\nin the weighted average assumed discount rate\nfrom 5.12% to 5.78%, and a decrease in the\nvalue of plan assets by $508 million,\nprimarily driven by market prices. The impact\nof the sale on Truist pension plans resulted\nin a reduction of pension benefit obligations\nby $97 million which was recorded as a\nreduction of AOCI.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 15.
