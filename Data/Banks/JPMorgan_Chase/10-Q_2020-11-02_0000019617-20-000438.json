The Firm\nreported ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 19%.\nThe Firm's results for the third\nquarter of 2020 included firmwide legal\nexpense of $524 million.\n\n\u2022 The Firm had net income of $9.4\nbillion, up 4%.\n\n\u2022 Total net revenue was flat. Net\ninterest income was $13.0 billion, down\n9%, predominantly driven by the impact\nof lower rates largely offset by higher\nnet interest income in CIB Markets as\nwell as balance sheet growth.\nNoninterest revenue was $16.1 billion,\nup 7%, predominantly driven by higher\nInvestment Banking fees, Markets\nrevenue, and Credit Adjustments & Other\nin the CIB, and higher net investment\nsecurities gains in Corporate.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense was $16.9\nbillion, up 3%, primarily driven by\nhigher legal expense predominantly in\nCIB and an impairment on a legacy\ninvestment in Corporate, partially\noffset by lower marketing expense in\nCCB.\n                                        5                                         \n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was\n$611 million, down $903 million from\nthe prior year. Net charge-offs of $1.2\nbillion were down $191 million from the\nprior year, predominantly driven by\nCard, which reflected lower charge-offs\nand higher recoveries, and benefited\nfrom the effect of payment assistance\nand government stimulus programs. The\ncurrent quarter included a net\nreduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses that was largely driven by\npaydowns in the Home Lending portfolio\nand changes in wholesale loan balances,\npartially offset by an addition to the\nallowance for the investment securities\nportfolio due to the transfer of\ncertain securities from available-for-\nsale to held-to-maturity. The prior\nyear included net additions to the\nallowance for credit losses across both\nthe Consumer and Wholesale portfolios.\n\n\u2022 The total allowance for credit losses\nwas $33.8 billion at September 30,\n2020. The Firm had an allowance for\nloan losses to retained loans coverage\nratio of 3.26%, compared with 3.27% in\nthe second quarter of 2020, and 1.42%\nin the prior year; the increase from\nthe prior year was driven by the\nadditions to the allowance for credit\nlosses and the adoption of CECL.\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets\ntotaled $11.5 billion at September 30,\n2020, an increase of $1.7 billion from\nthe second quarter of 2020, driven by\ncustomers that have exited COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and were 90\nor more days past due in Home Lending\nin CCB, and downgrades in the wholesale\nportfolio across multiple industries on\nclient credit deterioration.\nNonperforming assets increased from\n$6.0 billion in the prior year due to\ndowngrades in the wholesale portfolio,\nas well as from the adoption of CECL,\nas the purchased credit deteriorated\nloans in the mortgage portfolio became\nsubject to nonaccrual loan treatment.\n\n\u2022 Firmwide average loans of $991\nbillion were up 1%, largely reflecting\nhigher loan balances in AWM, as well as\nloans originated under the Small\nBusiness Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d)\nPaycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d),\noffset by lower loan balances in Home\nLending and Card.\n\n\u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.0\ntrillion were up 30%, reflecting\nsignificant inflows across the Firm,\nprimarily driven by the COVID-19\npandemic and the related effect of\ncertain government actions.\n\n\u2022 As of September 30, 2020 the Firm had\naverage High Quality Liquid Assets\n(\u201cHQLA\u201d) of approximately $670 billion\nand unencumbered marketable securities\nwith a fair value of approximately $660\nbillion, resulting in approximately\n$1.3 trillion of liquidity sources.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 55\u201359 for additional information.\n                                                                                  \n  Selected capital-related metrics                                                \n                                                                                  \n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s CET1 capital was $198\nbillion, and the Standardized and\nAdvanced CET1 ratios were 13.1% and\n13.8%, respectively.\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s SLR was 7.0%. The SLR\nreflects the temporary exclusions of\nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks, as required\nby the Federal Reserve\u2019s interim final\nrule issued on April 1, 2020.

The Firm\ncontinues to actively monitor the\ndynamic health and safety situations at\nlocal and regional levels, and plans\nremain flexible to adapt as these\nsituations evolve.\n\nSupporting clients and customers\n\nSince March 2020 the Firm has provided\nassistance to clients and customers\nprimarily in the form of payment\ndeferrals on loans and auto leases.\n\nRefer to Credit Portfolio on pages\n60-61 for information on assistance\ngranted to customers and clients. Refer\nto Consumer Credit portfolio on pages\n62-66 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on\npages 67-76 for information on retained\nloans under payment deferral.\n\nThe Firm has gradually re-opened its\nbranches since April, with nearly 90%\nof its branches returning to full\nservice as of the third quarter of\n2020. Additionally, the Firm continues\nto make a wide range of banking\nservices accessible to clients and\ncustomers through mobile and other\ndigital channels.\n\nProtecting and supporting employees\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, the Firm\nimplemented alternative work\narrangements, with the vast majority of\nits global workforce working from home.\n\nWhile the majority of the Firm\u2019s\nemployees globally continue to work\nfrom home, the Firm continues to return\nemployees to the office.\n\nSupporting communities\n\nSince March, the Firm has committed\n$250 million to help address\nhumanitarian needs and long-term\neconomic challenges posed by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the communities in\nwhich the Firm operates. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020 nearly half of this\ncommitment has been funded.\n                                                                                  \n  Departure of the U.K. from the EU                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm continues to execute on its\nFirmwide Brexit Implementation program\nand remains focused on the following\nkey areas to ensure continuation of\nservice to its EU clients: regulatory\nand legal entity readiness; client\nreadiness; and business and operational\nreadiness.\n\nThe Firm is preparing for the\npossibility that the U.K. will complete\nits departure from the EU without\nhaving agreed the terms of their future\nrelationship, which is commonly\nreferred to as \u201chard Brexit.\u201d The Firm\nis therefore preparing to finalize and\nimplement the various components of its\nBrexit readiness plan by year-end,\nincluding completion of the relocation\nof approximately 200 front office roles\nfrom the U.K. to EU locations, and the\nmigration of remaining EU clients and\ncertain positions to EU entities by the\nend of the year. A key factor in that\nplan will be to secure client\nengagement; any delays may impact the\nFirm\u2019s ability to continue servicing EU\nclients, as the Firm\u2019s U.K.-based legal\nentities are expected to lose their\nability to transact business from the\nU.K. with EU clients at the end of the\nyear.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has introduced\nadditional risk to the Firm\u2019s Brexit\nImplementation program. Infection rates\nand travel restrictions are increasing\nand lock-downs have been introduced\nacross various U.K. and EU locations.\nAs a result, the risk that clients may\nnot be operationally ready and that the\nFirm may not be able to relocate\nemployees by year-end is rising. Unless\nsome official-sector solution is\nforthcoming, the Firm\u2019s ability to\ncontinue servicing EU clients may be\nadversely affected.\n                                        9                                         \n                                                                                  \n  Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cIBOR\u201d) transition                                      \n                                                                                  \nOn March 12, 2020, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d)\nissued an accounting standards update\nproviding optional expedients and\nexceptions for applying generally\naccepted accounting principles to\ncontracts and hedge accounting\nrelationships affected by reference\nrate reform. These optional expedients\nare intended to simplify the\noperational impact of applying U.S.\nGAAP to transactions impacted by\nreference rate reform. The Firm elected\nto apply certain of these expedients\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2020.\nOn August 27, 2020, the International\nAccounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d)\nissued guidance that provides similar\nrelief for entities reporting under\nInternational Financial Reporting\nStandards (\"IFRS\"). Refer to Accounting\nand Reporting Developments on page 91\nfor additional information. The Firm\ncontinues to monitor the transition\nrelief being considered by the U.S.\nTreasury Department regarding the tax\nimplications of reference rate reform.\n\nThe Firm also continues to develop and\nimplement plans to appropriately\nmitigate the risks associated with IBOR\ndiscontinuation.

On March 23, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued an interim final\nrule that revised the definition of\n\u201celigible retained income\u201d for purposes\nof the total loss-absorbing capacity\n(\u201cTLAC\u201d) buffer requirements that apply\nto global systemically important\nbanking organizations. The revised\ndefinition of eligible retained income\nmakes any automatic limitations on\npayout distributions that could apply\nunder the agencies\u2019 capital rules or\nTLAC rule take effect on a more\ngraduated basis in the event that a\nbanking organization\u2019s capital,\nleverage and TLAC ratios were to\ndecline below regulatory requirements\n(including buffers). The March 17, 2020\ninterim final rule was issued, in\nconjunction with an interagency\nstatement encouraging banking\norganizations to use their capital and\nliquidity buffers, to further support\nbanking organizations\u2019 abilities to\nlend to households and businesses\naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On\nAugust 26, 2020, the federal banking\nagencies issued the final rule\nconsistent with the interim final rules\npublished on March 17, 2020 and March\n23, 2020.\n\nReserve requirements . On March 26,\n2020, the Federal Reserve reduced\nreserve requirement ratios to zero\npercent, effectively eliminating the\nreserve requirement for all depository\ninstitutions, an action that freed up\nliquidity in the banking system to\nsupport lending to households and\nbusinesses.\n\nRefer to Note 21 for additional\ninformation on the reduction to the\nreserve requirement.\n\nRegulatory Capital - Current Expected\nCredit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) transition\ndelay. On March 31, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim\nfinal rule (issued as final on\n\nAugust 26, 2020) that provided banking\norganizations with the option to delay\nthe effects of CECL on regulatory\ncapital for two years, followed by a\nthree-year transition period (\u201cCECL\ncapital transition provisions\u201d). The\nFirm elected to apply the CECL capital\ntransition provisions.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 49-54 and Note 22 on pages\n177\u2013178 for additional information on\nthe CECL capital transition provisions\nand the impact to the Firm\u2019s capital\nmetrics.\n\nSupplementary leverage ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)\ntemporary revision. On April 1, 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve issued an interim\nfinal rule that requires, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of\ntotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR for bank holding\ncompanies, to exclude the on-balance\nsheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks. These exclusions became\neffective April 1, 2020, and will\nremain in effect through March 31,\n2021.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 49-54 and Note 22 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s SLR.\n\nLoan modifications. On April 7, 2020,\nthe federal banking agencies along with\nthe National Credit Union\nAdministration, and the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, in\nconsultation with the state financial\nregulators, issued an interagency\nstatement revising a March 22, 2020\ninteragency statement on loan\nmodifications and the reporting for\nfinancial institutions working with\ncustomers affected by the COVID-19\npandemic (the \u201cIA Statement\u201d). The IA\nStatement reconfirmed that efforts to\nwork with borrowers where the loans are\nprudently underwritten, and not\nconsidered past due or carried on\nnonaccrual status, should not result in\nthe loans automatically being\nconsidered modified in a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) for accounting\nand financial reporting purposes, or\nfor purposes of their respective risk-\nbased capital rules, which would\notherwise require financial\ninstitutions subject to the capital\nrules to hold more capital. The IA\nStatement also clarified the\ninteraction between its previous\nguidance and Section 4013 of the CARES\nAct, which provides certain financial\ninstitutions with the option to suspend\nthe application of accounting guidance\nfor TDRs for a limited period of time\nfor loan modifications made to address\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Firm has granted various forms of\nassistance to customers and clients\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered\nTDRs as:\n\n\u2022 they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether\nunder the Firm\u2019s regular loan\nmodification assessments or the IA\nStatement guidance, or\n\n\u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the\noption to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs as\nprovided under section 4013 of the\nCARES Act.\n                                        11                                        \nTo the extent that certain\nmodifications do not meet any of the\nabove criteria, the Firm accounts for\nthem as TDRs. Refer to Credit Portfolio\non pages 60-61 and Note 12 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nloan modification activities.\n\nU.S. government facilities and programs\n. Beginning in March 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced a suite of facilities\nusing its emergency lending powers\nunder section 13(3) of the Federal\nReserve Act to support the flow of\ncredit to individuals, households and\nbusinesses adversely affected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and to support the\nbroader economy. In addition, beginning\nApril 3, 2020, the PPP, established by\nthe CARES Act and administered by the\nSBA, authorized eligible lenders to\nprovide nonrecourse loans to eligible\nborrowers until August 8, 2020 to\nprovide an incentive for these\nbusinesses to keep their workers on\ntheir payroll. The Firm has\nparticipated and is participating in\ncertain of these facilities and\nprograms, as needed, to assist its\nclients and customers or to support the\nbroader economy.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 49-54, Liquidity Risk Management\non pages 55\u201359 and Note 22 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nparticipation in these facilities.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 49-54, Credit Portfolio on pages\n60-61 and Note 22 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s participation\nin the PPP.\n                                        12                                        \n                                      \n  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \n                                      \nThis section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated\nResults of Operations on a reported basis for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019, unless otherwise specified.

In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and\nlending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied\nwhen determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n                                                                                  \n  Quarterly results                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe provision for credit losses\ndecreased driven by both the consumer\nand wholesale portfolios.\n\nThe decrease in consumer reflected:\n\n\u2022 a $300 million reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses in Home\nLending due to paydowns; a $100 million\nreduction in the allowance in the\nBusiness Banking consumer portfolio,\nwhich was offset by an addition to the\nallowance in the Business Banking\nwholesale portfolio; resulting in no\nchange to CBB\u2019s overall allowance for\ncredit losses, and\n\n\u2022 lower net charge-offs in Card, which\nreflected lower charge-offs and higher\nrecoveries, and benefited from the\neffect of payment assistance and\ngovernment stimulus programs.\n\nThe prior year included a $138 million\nnet addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nThe wholesale provision was a net\nbenefit as a result of reductions in\nthe allowance for credit losses across\nCIB, CB and AWM, driven by changes in\nloan balances, partially offset by an\naddition to the allowance in CCB\nBusiness Banking as noted above. The\nprior year provision was largely driven\nby select Commercial & Industrial\n(\"C&I\") client downgrades.\n\nThe investment securities provision was\npredominantly driven by the transfer of\ncertain securities from available-for-\nsale (\"AFS\") to held-to-maturity\n(\"HTM\").\n\nRefer to CCB segment results on pages\n26-30, CIB on pages 31-37, CB on pages\n38-41, AWM on pages 42-45,

              \nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased primarily driven by the\ndeterioration and uncertainty in the\nmacroeconomic environment as a result\nof the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nin consumer and wholesale.\n\nThe increase in consumer reflected:\n\n\u2022 net additions of $8.3 billion to the\nallowance for credit losses, consisting\nof $6.6 billion for Card, $900 million\nfor Home Lending, $520 million for\nAuto, and $252 million for Business\nBanking,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 lower net charge-offs largely in\nCard, which reflected higher\nrecoveries, and in Home Lending,\nreflecting higher recoveries on a loan\nsale in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThe prior year included an $83 million\nnet reduction in the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nThe increase in wholesale reflected a\nnet addition of $6.7 billion to the\nallowance for credit losses across the\nLOBs impacting multiple industry\nsectors.\n\nThe investment securities provision

lending-related\npositions from trading assets to loans\nand other assets. Prior-period amounts\nhave been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.\n\nCash and due from banks and deposits\nwith banks increased primarily as a\nresult of significant deposit inflows,\nwhich also funded asset growth across\nthe Firm, including in investment\nsecurities and securities purchased\nunder resale agreements. Deposits with\nbanks reflect the Firm\u2019s placements of\nits excess cash with various central\nbanks, including the Federal Reserve\nBanks.\n\nFederal funds sold and securities\npurchased under resale agreements\nincreased predominantly as a result of\nhigher deployment of cash in Treasury\nand CIO, as well as the impact of\nclient activity and higher demand for\nsecurities to cover short positions in\nCIB. Refer to Liquidity Ri sk\nManagement on pages 55\u201359 and Note 11\nfor additional information.\n\nTrading assets increased compared with\nlower levels at year-end due to client-\ndriven market-making activities in debt\nand equity instruments in CIB Markets,\nas well as higher derivative\nreceivables as a result of market\nmovements, also in CIB. Refer to Notes\n2 and 5 for additional information.\n\nInvestment securitie s increased,\nreflecting net purchases of U.S.\nTreasuries and U.S. GSE and government\nagency MBS in the available-for-sale\n(\u201cAFS\u201d) portfolio, driven by interest\nrate risk management activities and\ncash deployment, partially offset by a\nnon-cash transfer of $100.5 billion of\nAFS securities to the held-to-maturity\n(\u201cHTM\u201d) portfolio, resulting in a\ncomparable increase in HTM; the\ntransfer was made for capital\nmanagement purposes.\n\nRefer to Corporate segment results on\npages 46-47, Investment Portfolio Risk\nManagement on page 79, and\n\nNotes 2 and 10 for additional\ninformation on Investment securities.\n\nLoans decreased, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 lower loans in Card due to the\ndecline in sales volume that began in\nMarch as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, as well as the impact of\nseasonality; and lower loans in Home\nLending primarily due to paydowns and\nloan sales, net of originations,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 the impact of the PPP loans in CBB\nand CB, as well as growth in wholesale\nloans and mortgages in AWM.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses increased\nprimarily reflecting the deterioration\nand uncertainty in the macroeconomic\nenvironment as a result of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting\nof:\n\n\u2022 a net $8.3 billion addition in\nconsumer, predominantly in the credit\ncard and residential real estate\nportfolios\n\n\u2022 a net $5.2 billion addition in\nwholesale, across the LOBs impacting\nmultiple industry sectors, and\n\n\u2022 a net $4.2 billion addition as a\nresult of the adoption of CECL.\n\nThere were also additions to the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is included in other\nliabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets, of $1.5 billion related to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and\n$98 million related to the adoption of\nCECL, resulting in total additions to\nthe allowance for credit losses of\n$15.0 billion and $4.3 billion,\nrespectively, as of September 30, 2020.\n                                        18                                        \nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk\nManagement on pages 60-79, and Notes 1,\n2, 3, 12 and 13 for a more detailed\ndiscussion of loans and the allowance\nfor loan losses.\n\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangibles\ndecreased reflecting lower MSRs as a\nresult of faster prepayment speeds on\nlower rates and the realization of\nexpected cash flows, partially offset\nby net additions to the MSRs. Refer to\nNote 15 for additional information.\n\nOther assets increased reflecting\nhigher cash collateral placed with\ncentral counterparties in CIB.

Refer to Notes 2 and\n5 for additional information.\n\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\nincreased reflecting higher client\npayables related to client-driven\nactivities in CIB.\n\nBeneficial interests issued by\nconsolidated VIEs increased primarily\nreflecting higher levels of Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduit\ncommercial paper held by third parties.\n\nRefer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\non page 21 and Notes 14 and 23 for\nfurther information on Firm-sponsored\nVIEs and loan securitization trusts.\n\nLong-term debt decreased as a result of\nmaturities of FHLB advances; net\nmaturities of senior debt, which\nincluded the early termination of\ncertain of the Firm's debt; partially\noffset by an issuance of subordinated\ndebt, and higher fair value hedge\naccounting adjustments related to lower\ninterest rates.

Financing activities \u2022 In 2020, cash provided reflected higher\ndeposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially\noffset by net payments of long term borrowings. \u2022 In 2019, cash provided resulted\nfrom higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. \u2022\nFor both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends\non common and preferred stock. On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common equity.\nSubsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large bank holding companies,\nincluding the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of the\nfourth quarter of 2020. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on\npages 18-19, Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54, and Liquidity Risk Management\non pages 55\u201359 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 93\u201398 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm\u2019s cash flows.\n                                        20                                        \n                                  \n  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \n                                  \nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet\narrangements and contractual obligations that may require future cash payments.\nCertain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as\noff-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n                                                                                  \n  Special-purpose entities                                                        \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm has several types of off\u2013balance sheet arrangements, including through\nnonconsolidated special-purpose entities (\u201cSPEs\u201d), which are a type of VIE, and\nthrough lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).\n\nThe Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and\nrelated exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments\nand guarantees.\n\nThe Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction,\nand its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm\u2019s length\nand reflect market pricing.\n\nThe table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found.

In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined\nbased on the products and services\nprovided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer\nto Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 22-23 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The\nFirm\u2019s LOBs also provide various\nbusiness metrics which are utilized by\nthe Firm and its investors and analysts\nin assessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue and expense are generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible\nfor the related product or service,\nwith allocations to the other\nsegment(s)\n\ninvolved in the transaction. The\nsegment results reflect these revenue-\nsharing agreements.\n\nBusiness segment capital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nbusiness is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital\nare assessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on business segment capital\nallocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results \u2013\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology on pages 60\u201361 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n\nBusiness segment changes\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm\nbegan reporting a Wholesale Payments\nbusiness unit within CIB following a\nrealignment of the Firm\u2019s wholesale\npayments businesses. The Wholesale\nPayments business comprises:\n\n\u2022 Merchant Services, which was\nrealigned from CCB to CIB\n\n\u2022 Treasury Services and Trade Finance\nin CIB. Trade Finance was previously\nreported in Lending in CIB.\n\nIn connection with the alignment of\nWholesale Payments, the assets,\nliabilities and headcount associated\nwith the Merchant Services business\nwere realigned to CIB from CCB, and the\nrevenue and expenses of the Merchant\nServices business are reported across\nCCB, CIB and CB based primarily on\nclient relationships. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to reflect\nthis realignment and revised allocation\nmethodology.\n                                                                                  \n

\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The\nadoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are\nconsidered purchased credit deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) loans under CECL. Refer to Note 1\nfor further information.\n\n(a) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm\nrecognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was\nperforming.\n\n(b) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or\nmore days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $851 million and\n$1.6 billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation, refer to footnote (c) below for additional information.\nThese amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.\n\n(c) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option\nelected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\n(d) At September 30, 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates included PCD loans. The\nrate prior to January 1, 2020 was revised to include the impact of PCI loans.\n\n(e) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies of $1.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, that are 30 or\nmore days past due. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation, refer to footnote (c) above for additional information.\nThese amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.\n\n(f) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 for\nfurther information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes loans to\ncustomers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more\ndays past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent and\ncharged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less costs to sell.\n\n(g) At September 30, 2020, included $20.3 billion of loans in Business Banking\nunder the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not\nexpect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio\non pages 60-61 for a further discussion of the PPP.\n\n(h) At September 30, 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card\nand Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19\npandemic were $10.2 billion, $368 million and $411 million, respectively.

activities. When the\nFirm extends a consumer or wholesale\nloan, advises customers and clients on\ntheir investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other\nproducts or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm\u2019s overall\nobjective is to manage its businesses,\nand the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of\nits clients, customers and investors\nand protects the safety and soundness\nof the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires,\namong other things: \u2022 Acceptance of\nresponsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risk\nissues, by all individuals within the\nFirm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and\nmanagement within each of the LOBs and\nCorporate; and \u2022 Firmwide structures\nfor risk governance. The Firm strives\nfor continual improvement in its\nefforts to enhance controls, ongoing\nemployee training and development,\ntalent retention, and other measures.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and\nbalanced compensation framework with\nstrong internal governance and\nindependent oversight by the Board of\nDirectors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of\nrisk and control issues is carefully\nconsidered in the Firm\u2019s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation\nprocesses. Risk governance and\noversight framework The Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement governance and oversight\nframework involves understanding\ndrivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

However, the continuation\nor further deterioration of the current\nmacroeconomic environment could result\nin impacts to the Firm\u2019s capital and\nleverage.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III\nestablish minimum capital ratios and\noverall capital adequacy standards for\nlarge and internationally active U.S.\nbank holding companies (\u201cBHC\u201d) and\nbanks, including the Firm and its\ninsured depository institution (\u201cIDI\u201d)\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approach banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page\n90 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K\nfor additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses. As\ndisclosed in the Firm\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K,\nthe Firm initially elected to phase-in\nthe January 1, 2020 (\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL\nadoption impact to retained earnings of\n$2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25%\nper year in each of 2020 to 2023. As\npart of their response to the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued an interim final rule (issued as\nfinal on August 26, 2020) that provided\nthe option to delay the effects of CECL\non regulatory capital for two years,\nfollowed by a three-year transition\nperiod (\u201cCECL capital transition\nprovisions\u201d).\n\nThe final rule provides a uniform\napproach for estimating the effects of\nCECL compared to the legacy incurred\nloss model during the first two years\nof the transition period (the \u201cday 2\u201d\ntransition amount), whereby the Firm\nmay exclude from CET1 capital 25% of\nthe change in the allowance for credit\nlosses (excluding allowances on PCD\nloans). The cumulative day 2 transition\namount as at December 31, 2021 that is\nnot recognized in CET1 capital as well\nas the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will\nbe phased into CET1 capital at 25% per\nyear beginning January 1, 2022. The\nFirm has elected to apply the CECL\ncapital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, the capital metrics\nof the Firm exclude $6.4 billion, which\nis the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to\nretained earnings and 25% of the $15.2\nbillion increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses (excluding allowances on\nPCD loans).\n\nThe impacts of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions on Tier 2\ncapital, adjusted average assets, and\ntotal leverage exposure have also been\nincorporated into the Firm\u2019s capital\nmetrics. Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation on the CECL accounting\nguidance.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility (\"MMLF\") . On March 18, 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve established the\nMMLF facility, authorized through\nSeptember 30, 2020, to enhance the\nliquidity and functioning of money\nmarkets. On July 28, 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that it was extending\nthe MMLF through December 31, 2020.\nUnder the MMLF, the FRBB makes\nnonrecourse advances to participating\nfinancial institutions to purchase\ncertain types of assets from eligible\nmoney market mutual fund clients. These\nassets, which are reflected in other\nassets on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets, are pledged to the FRBB\nas collateral. On March 23, 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\nSeptember 29, 2020) to neutralize the\neffects of purchasing assets through\nthe program on risk-based and leverage-\nbased capital ratios. As of September\n30, 2020, the Firm excluded assets\npurchased from money market mutual fund\nclients pursuant to nonrecourse\nadvances provided under the MMLF in the\namount of $932 million from its RWA and\n$2.2 billion from adjusted average\nassets and total leverage exposure.\n\nSupplementary leverage ratio temporary\nrevision. On April 1, 2020, the Federal\nReserve issued an interim final rule\nthat requires, on a temporary basis,\nthe calculation of total leverage\nexposure for purposes of calculating\nthe SLR for bank holding companies, to\nexclude the on-balance sheet amounts of\nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks. These\nexclusions became effective April 1,\n2020, and will remain in effect through\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve,\nOCC and FDIC issued an interim final\nrule that provides IDI subsidiaries\nwith an option to apply this temporary\nexclusion subject to certain\n                                        49                                        \nrestrictions. As of September 30, 2020,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not\nelected to apply this exclusion.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program. On April\n13, 2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued an interim final rule (issued as\nfinal on September 29, 2020) to\nneutralize the regulatory capital\neffects of participating in the PPP on\nrisk-based capital ratios by applying a\nzero percent risk weight to loans\noriginated under the program. Given\nthat PPP loans are guaranteed by the\nSBA, the Firm does not expect to\nrealize material credit losses on these\nloans. As of September 30, 2020, the\nFirm had approximately $28 billion of\nloans under the program.\n\nThe rule also provides that if the PPP\nloan is pledged as collateral for a\nnon-recourse loan under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program\nLending (\u201cPPPL\u201d) Facility, the PPP\nloans can be excluded from leverage-\nbased capital ratios. As of September\n30, 2020, the Firm had not participated\nin the PPPL Facility.\n\nRefer to Regulatory Developments\nRelating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on\npages 11-12 for additional information\non regulatory actions and significant\nfinancing programs that the U.S.\ngovernment and regulators have\nintroduced to address the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStress Capital Buffer (\"SCB\"). On March\n4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued the\nfinal rule introducing the SCB\nframework\n\nfor the Basel III Standardized approach\nthat is designed to more closely\nintegrate the results of the\nquantitative assessment in the annual\nCCAR with the ongoing minimum capital\nrequirements for BHCs under the U.S.\nBasel III rules. The final rule\nreplaces the static 2.5% CET1 capital\nconservation buffer in the Standardized\napproach with a dynamic institution-\nspecific SCB. The final rule does not\napply to the Advanced approach capital\nrequirements. The SCB requirement for\nBHCs will be effective on October 1 of\neach year and is expected to remain in\neffect until September 30 of the\nfollowing year.\n\nTLAC Holdings rule . On October 20,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for\nholdings of TLAC debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. This rule expands the scope\nof the existing capital deductions rule\naround the holdings of capital\ninstruments of financial institutions\nto also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important\nbanking organizations. The rule is\nintended to limit interconnectedness\nwithin the financial system and reduce\nsystemic risk. The final rule will\nbecome effective on April 1, 2021.\n\nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s\nrisk-based and leverage-based capital\nmetrics under both the Basel III\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 85\u201392 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019\nForm 10-K for a further discussion of\nthese capital metrics.\n

(d) Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that\nare not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm\u2019s average LCR decreased\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared with the three-month\nperiod ended June 30, 2020, due to an increase in net cash outflows largely due to\nmarket activities in the CIB. Liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased\nduring the quarter primarily due to growth in deposits and a reduction in loans.\nDeposits continued to increase in the third quarter primarily driven by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of certain government actions. However,\nthese increases in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are excluded from\nthe Firm\u2019s reported LCR under the LCR rule.\n\nThe Firm's average LCR was negatively impacted during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, compared with the prior year period due to a significant\nincrease in deposits impacting both HQLA and net cash outflows. However, the\naverage net excess HQLA has increased during the same period, primarily due to an\nincrease in cash from unsecured long-term debt issuances. The Firm\u2019s average LCR\nfluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net\ncash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In\naddition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s HQLA above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income\ndebt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.\nThis includes securities included as part of the excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, as described above.\nThe fair value of these securities was approximately $660 billion and $315 billion\nas of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, although the amount\nof liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market\nconditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2019, due to an\nincrease in excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result\nof increased deposits as noted above. The Firm also had available borrowing\ncapacity at FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result\nof collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $295 billion and\n$322 billion as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This\nborrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the\nFirm\u2019s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing\ncapacity decreased from December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower credit card\nreceivable balances driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease in pledged\nmortgage collateral as a result of paydown and maturity activity. Although\navailable, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve\nBank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\nNSFR The net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a liquidity requirement for large\nbanking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d and\n\u201crequired\u201d amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020,\nthe federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking\norganizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least\n100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1,\n2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average\nNSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.\n                                        55                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Funding                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Sources of funds                                                                \n                                                                                  \nManagement believes that the Firm\u2019s\nunsecured and secured funding capacity\nis sufficient to meet its on- and off-\nbalance sheet obligations.\n\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet\nthrough diverse sources of funding\nincluding stable deposits, secured and\nunsecured funding in the capital\nmarkets and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nDeposits are the primary funding source\nfor JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nmay also access funding through short-\nor long-term secured borrowings,\nthrough the issuance of unsecured long-\nterm debt, or from borrowings from the\n\nParent Company or the Intermediate\nHolding Company (\u201cIHC\u201d).

In the wholesale\nbusinesses, the inflows principally occurred in March as clients looked to remain\nliquid as a result of market conditions; in general, balances remained elevated\nthrough the third quarter. In CCB, the increase was driven by lower spending and\nhigher cash balances across both consumer and small business customers, as well as\ngrowth from existing and new accounts.

These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at September 30,\n2020, compared with December 31, 2019,\nreflecting in CIB, higher secured\nfinancing of trading assets, partially\noffset by a decline in client-driven\nmarket-making activities, and the\nFirm's nonparticipation in the Federal\nReserve's open market operations, and\nin Treasury and CIO, higher secured\nfinancing of AFS investment securities.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ncustomers\u2019 investment and financing\nactivities, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, the Firm\nparticipated in the MMLF government\nfacility. The secured nonrecourse\nadvances under the MMLF are included in\nother borrowed\n\nfunds. Refer to Capital Risk Management\non pages 49-54 for additional\ninformation on the MMLF.\n\nThe Primary Dealer Credit Facility\n(\"PDCF\") was established by the Federal\nReserve on March 20, 2020. Under the\nPDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork (\u201cFRBNY\u201d) provides collateralized\nfinancing on a term basis to primary\ndealers. These financing transactions\nwere reported as securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase. The Firm\nparticipated in the PDCF in the first\nquarter of 2020, and ceased its\nparticipation in May 2020 as the\nsecured financing market normalized.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding consist of other\nborrowed funds and issuance of\nwholesale commercial paper. The\ndecrease in commercial paper at\nSeptember 30, 2020, from December 31,\n2019 and for the average three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\ncompared to the prior year period, was\ndue to lower net issuance primarily for\nshort-term liquidity management. The\nincrease in other borrowed funds at\nSeptember 30, 2020 from December 31,\n2019 is primarily driven by an increase\nin financing activities in CIB Equity\nMarkets.\n                                        57                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for\nthe Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client\nactivity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC.\nLong-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing\nmarket access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by\nthe Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net\nfunding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties.

In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL,\nthe Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from\nthe consumer, excluding credit card\nportfolio segment to the wholesale\nportfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining\nthe allowance. Prior-period amounts\nhave been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Refer to Note 1\nfor further information.\n\nThe Firm has provided various forms of\nassistance to customers and clients\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered\nt roubled debt restructurings ( \u201c TDRs\n\u201d ) as:\n\n\u2022 they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether\nunder the Firm\u2019s regular loan\nmodification assessments or the IA\nStatement guidance, or\n\n\u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the\noption to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs as\nprovided under section 4013 of the\nCARES Act.\n\nTo the extent that certain\nmodifications do not meet any of the\nabove criteria, the Firm accounts for\nthem as TDRs. The Firm considers\nexpected losses of principal and\naccrued interest associated with all\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications in\nits allowance for credit losses. Refer\nto Business Developments on pages 9-10\nfor more information on customer and\nclient assistance granted. Refer to\nNotes 12 and 13 for further information\non the Firm\u2019s accounting policies on\nloan modifications and the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s actions\nin helping borrowers recover and in\nmitigating the Firm\u2019s credit losses\nremains uncertain in light of the\nunpredictable nature and duration of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Assistance\nprovided in response to the COVID-19\npandemic could delay the recognition of\ndelinquencies, nonaccrual status, and\nnet charge-offs for those customers and\nclients who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status.\nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on\npages 62-66 and Wholesale Credit\nPortfolio on pages 67-76 for\ninformation on loan modifications as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nIn the following tables, reported loans\ninclude loans retained (i.e., held-for-\ninvestment); loans held-for-sale; and\ncertain loans accounted for at fair\nvalue. The following tables do not\ninclude loans which the Firm accounts\nfor at fair value and classifies as\ntrading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3\nfor further information regarding these\nloans.

(e) Includes collateral related to derivative\ninstruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or\nobtained with respect to master netting agreements. (f) At both September 30,\n2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or\nmore days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.1 billion. Prior-\nperiod amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation, refer to\nfootnote (a) above for additional information. At September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, nonperforming assets also excluded real estate owned (\u201cREO\u201d) insured by\nU.S. government agencies of $10 million and $41 million, respectively. These\namounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the\nFirm\u2019s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on\nnonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council (\u201cFFIEC\u201d). (g) At September 30, 2020,\nnonperforming loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans on nonaccrual status. Prior\nto the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm\nrecognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was\nperforming.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented\nby the SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to process and originate\nPPP loans until the program closed in early August 2020. When certain criteria are\nmet, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the\nforgiveness amount from the SBA. PPP loans have a contractual term of two or five\nyears and provide borrowers with an automatic payment deferral of principal and\ninterest. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect\nto realize material credit losses on these loans. PPP processing fees are deferred\nand accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the loans, but may\nbe accelerated upon forgiveness or prepayment. The impact on interest income\nrelated to PPP loans was not material for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion\nof loans under the PPP, of which $20 billion and $8 billion are in Consumer and\nWholesale, respectively.\n                                        61                                        \n                             \n  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                             \nThe Firm\u2019s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real\nestate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and business banking loans, as well\nas associated lending-related commitments. The Firm\u2019s focus is on serving\nprimarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. Refer to Note 12 for\nfurther information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual and\ncharge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 23 for further information on\nlending-related commitments.\n\nWeakness in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic, resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the first\nhalf of 2020. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic on the macroeconomic environment and the extent to which customer\nassistance and government stimulus efforts are effective could result in further\nimpacts to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual loans and\ncharge-offs.\n\nThe following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to\nthe scored credit portfolios held in CCB, AWM, CIB and Corporate.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored\nmortgage loans held in Corporate.\n\n(b) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, excluded operating lease assets\nof $21.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively.

For credit card commitments, and if certain\nconditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking\ncommitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the\nborrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice.

During the third quarter of 2020, there were approximately\n$2.2 billion of new enrollments in payment deferral programs largely in the\nresidential real estate loan class. Predominantly all borrowers that exited\npayment deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to monitor the credit\nrisk associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral\nperiod and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making\nregularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and\naccrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe following table presents information related to the $12.3 billion and $28.3\nbillion unpaid principal balance of retained loans under payment deferral programs\nas of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and those that

still under payment deferral programs as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Auto operating lease asset payment\nassistance is currently offering one month payment deferral (initially offered\nthree month payment deferral). Deferrals do not extend the term of the lease and\nall deferred payments are due at the end of the lease term.\n\n(c) Includes $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion of loans that were accounted for as\nTDRs prior to payment deferral as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\n(d) Represents the unpaid principal balance of retained loans which were still\nunder payment deferral programs, divided by the total unpaid principal balance of\nthe respective loan classes retained loans.\n\nOf the $12.3 billion of loans still under payment deferral programs as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, approximately $3.9 billion were accounted for as TDRs, either\nbecause they were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because they\ndid not qualify for or the Firm did not elect the option to suspend TDR accounting\nguidance provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act. All or a portion of the\nremaining $8.4 billion of loans could become TDRs in future periods, depending on\nthe nature and timing of further modifications or payment arrangements offered to\nthese borrowers. If the remaining $8.4 billion of loans were considered TDRs, the\nFirm estimates that it would result in an increase in standardized RWA of as much\nas $4.1 billion.\n\nPredominantly all borrowers were current upon enrollment in payment deferral\nprograms and are expected to exit payment deferral programs in a current status,\neither because no payments are contractually due during the deferral period or\nbecause payments originally contractually due during the deferral period will be\nmodified to be due at maturity upon exit. For those borrowers that are not\nmodified upon exit from payment deferral programs and are unable to resume making\npayments in accordance with the contractual terms of their agreements, they will\nbe placed on nonaccrual status in line with the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual policy, except\nfor credit cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and charged off in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s charge-off policies. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual and charge-off policies.\n                                        63                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Consumer, excluding credit card                                                 \n                                                                                  \nPortfolio analysis Loan balances\nincreased from December 31, 2019 due\npredominantly to PPP loan originations\nin Business Banking, partially offset\nby lower residential real estate loans,\nreflecting paydowns and loan sales.\nResidential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans\nat fair value, predominantly consists\nof prime mortgage loans and home equity\nlines of credit. The portfolio\ndecreased from December 31, 2019 driven\nby paydowns and loan sales in Home\nLending, largely offset by originations\nof prime mortgage loans that have been\nretained on the balance sheet. Retained\nnonaccrual loans increased from\nDecember 31, 2019 due predominantly to\nthe inclusion of PCD loans, which prior\nto the adoption of CECL were considered\nperforming PCI loans and customers that\nhave exited COVID-19 payment deferral\nprograms and are 90 or more days past\ndue. Net charge-offs for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2020 were\nhigher when compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year as the current\nquarter included losses associated with\nthe PCD portfolio, as well as loans\ncharged down to the lower of amortized\ncost or fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less costs to sell related\nto certain customers that have exited\nCOVID-19 payment deferral programs and\nare 90 or more days past due. Net\nrecoveries for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 were higher when\ncompared with the same period in the\nprior year as the current year\nbenefited from a recovery on a loan\nsale. The carrying value of home equity\nlines of credit outstanding was $25.8\nbillion at September 30, 2020. This\namount included $9.1 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $8.1 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the\nundrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile. At September 30, 2020,\nand December 31, 2019, the carrying\nvalue of interest-only residential\nmortgage loans were $24.8 billion and\n$22.5 billion, respectively. These\nloans have an interest-only payment\nperiod generally followed by an\nadjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity\nand are typically originated as higher-\nbalance loans to higher-income\nborrowers, predominantly in AWM.\nPerformance of this portfolio for the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2020 was in line with the\nperformance of the broader residential\nmortgage portfolio for the same period.\n\nThe following table provides a summary\nof the Firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nportfolio insured and/or guaranteed by\nU.S. government agencies, including\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

The September\n30, 2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency\nrates of 1.57% and 0.69%, respectively,\ndecreased compared to the December 31,\n2019 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates\nof 1.87% and 0.95%, respectively. The\ndelinquency rates were positively\nimpacted by borrowers who received\npayment assistance and government\nstimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for\nthe three months ended September 30,\n2020 compared with the same period in\nthe prior year reflecting lower charge-\noffs and higher recoveries, and\nbenefited from the effect of payment\nassistance and government stimulus\nprograms. Net charge-offs decreased for\nthe nine months ended September 30,\n2020 compared with the same period in\nthe prior year reflecting higher\nrecoveries.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all\ncredit card loans typically remain on\naccrual status until charged off.\nHowever, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated\nuncollectible portion of accrued and\nbilled interest and fee income. Refer\nto Note 12 for further information\nabout this portfolio, including\ninformation about delinquencies.\n\nGeographic and FICO composition of\ncredit card loans\n\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the\ngeographic and FICO composition of the\nFirm\u2019s credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  Modifications of credit card loans                                              \n                                                                                  \nAt September 30, 2020 the Firm had $1.4\nbillion of credit card loans\noutstanding that have been modified in\nTDRs, which does not include loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered\nTDRs, compared to $1.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2019.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 69-73\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business banking and\nauto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied\nwhen determining the allowance for credit losses. The macroeconomic environment,\ndriven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in broad-based credit\ndeterioration and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio\ndecreased from 74% to 71%, and criticized exposure increased $22.3 billion from\n$15.1 billion to $37.4 billion, primarily driven by downgrade activity in the\nfirst half of the year. The increase in criticized exposure was largely driven by\ndowngrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas. The continuation or worsening of\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result\nin further impacts to credit quality metrics, including investment-grade\npercentages, as well as to criticized and nonperforming exposures and charge-offs.\nLending-related commitments and retained loans increased by $23.7 billion and\n$19.2 billion, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven\nby increases across CB, AWM and CIB, including loans under the PPP. Outstanding\nloan balances under committed revolving credit facilities as of September 30, 2020\nhave returned to near the levels that existed before the increased drawdown\nactivity in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n                                                                                  \n  Who\u2026

The remaining deferrals are\nlargely concentrated in Real Estate, predominantly within multifamily and retail,\nnearly all of which are scheduled to resume payments in the fourth quarter. The\nFirm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to\ndeferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the\nborrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers\nexpected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance\nfor credit losses.\n                                                                                  \n  (in                                                                             \n  mil\u2026       Sept\u2026                                 June                           \n  exc\u2026         30,                                  30,                           \n  rat\u2026        2020                                 2020                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                     IG                                    IG     \n                      Perc\u2026       perc\u2026                    Perc\u2026       perce\u2026     \n                         of          of                       of           of     \n  Ind\u2026        Loan    total        loan            Loan    total         loan     \n             bala\u2026    indu\u2026       bala\u2026          balan\u2026    indu\u2026       balan\u2026     \n                       loan          in                     loan           in     \n                      bala\u2026       paym\u2026                    bala\u2026       payme\u2026     \n                                  defe\u2026                                defer\u2026     \n  Real    $  4,385        4  %       61  %    $   5,211        4  %        64  %  \n  Est\u2026                                                                            \n  Ind\u2026                                                                            \n  and          691        1          10             809        1            9     \n  Ind\u2026                                                                            \n  Ent\u2026                                                                            \n  Con\u2026                                                                            \n  &            413        1           6             690        1            4     \n  Ret\u2026                                                                            \n  Hea\u2026         100        \u2014           7             300        1           16     \n  Ind\u2026          91        \u2014           5             335        1           10     \n  Aut\u2026          15        \u2014           \u2014           8,827       46           72     \n  All                                                                             \n  oth\u2026         579        \u2014          70             603        \u2014           55     \n  ind\u2026                                                                            \n  Tot\u2026    $  6,274        1  %       51  %    $  16,775        3  %        61  %  \n  who\u2026                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the balance of the retained loans which were still under payment\ndeferral, divided by the respective industry total retained loans balance.\n\nIn addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications.\nThese types of assistance, both payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are\ngenerally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were\ninsignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs as provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act.\nThese loans continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm\u2019s overall credit\nrisk management framework.

The increase in total\ncriticized exposure was largely driven\nby downgrades in Consumer & Retail and\nOil & Gas due to impacts from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 23 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from Customers Receivables\nfrom customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage\nclients in CIB and AWM that are\ncollateralized by assets maintained in\nthe clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities),\nas such generally no allowance for\ncredit losses is held against these\nreceivables. To manage its credit risk\nthe Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts Derivatives enable\nclients and counterparties to manage\nrisks including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equities, and\ncommodities. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. Refer to Note 5 for a further\ndiscussion of derivative contracts. The\nfollowing table summarizes the net\nderivative receivables for the periods\npresented.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative receivables                 September 30,              December 31,  \n  (in millions)                          2020                       2019          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total, net of cash             76,626                     49,766                \n  collateral                                                                      \n  Liquid securities and                                                           \n  other collateral              -20,384                    -16,009                \n  held against derivative                                                         \n  receivables(a)                                                                  \n  Total, net of              $   56,242                 $   33,757                \n  collateral                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal\nopinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting\nagreements.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance\nsheets were $76.6 billion and $49.8 billion at September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral\nheld by the Firm. However, in management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid\nsecurities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other Group of\nSeven nations (\u201cG7\u201d) government securities) and other collateral held by the Firm\naggregating $20.4 billion and $16.0 billion at September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s exposure is in the Firm\u2019s favor. The Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government\nagency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)\ndelivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral\nrelated to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date.\nAlthough this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the\ntable above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts move in the\nFirm\u2019s favor.

Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses comprises: \u2022 the\nallowance for loan losses, which covers\nthe Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios\n(scored and risk-rated) and is\npresented separately on the balance\nsheet, \u2022 the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments, which is presented\non the balance sheet in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is\nrecognized within Investment Securities\non the balance sheet. Refer to Note 13\nand Note 10 for a description of the\npolicies, methodologies and judgments\nused to determine the Firm\u2019s allowances\nfor credit losses on loans, lending-\nrelated commitments, and investment\nsecurities. The allowance for credit\nlosses increased compared with December\n31, 2019, primarily reflecting the\ndeterioration and uncertainty in the\nmacroeconomic environment as a result\nof the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nconsisting of: \u2022 a net $8.3 billion\naddition in consumer, predominantly in\nthe credit card and residential real\nestate portfolios \u2022 a net $6.7 billion\naddition in wholesale, across the LOBs\nimpacting multiple industry sectors,\nand \u2022 a net $4.3 billion addition as a\nresult of the adoption of CECL.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nduring 2020 The increase in the\nallowance for loan losses and lending\nrelated commitments was primarily\ndriven by an increase in the provision\nfor credit losses, reflecting the\ndeterioration in and uncertainty around\nthe future macroeconomic environment as\na result of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. \u2013 In the first quarter of\n2020, management\u2019s macroeconomic\nforecast included a decline in the U.S.\nreal GDP of approximately 25% and an\nincrease in the U.S. unemployment rate\nto above 10%, for the first half of\n2020, followed by a solid recovery in\nthe second half of 2020. \u2013 In the\nsecond quarter of 2020, based on the\nincreased uncertainty around the\nduration and depth of the downturn and\nspeed of economic recovery, the Firm\u2019s\ncentral case assumptions reflected a\nmore protracted downturn with the\nslower recovery of U.S. real GDP. \u2013 In\nthe third quarter of 2020, the Firm\u2019s\ncentral case assumptions reflected some\nnear term improvement in economic\ntrends, however there is elevated\nuncertainty around potential impacts to\nmedium and longer term macroeconomic\nconditions .\n\nIn the first, second and third quarters\nof 2020, the Firm\u2019s central case\nassumptions reflected forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rates and cumulative\nchanges in U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                           \n                                            2020       2021                \n                                              4Q         2Q         4Q     \n  Central case assumptions                                                 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                                \n  1Q 2020                                    6.6  %     5.5  %     4.6  %  \n  2Q 2020                                   10.9        9.0        7.7     \n  3Q 2020                                    9.5        8.5        7.3     \n  U.S. real GDP - cumulative change from                                   \n  December 31, 2019                                                        \n  1Q 2020                                   -5.4       -2.3        0.3     \n  2Q 2020                                   -6.2       -4.0       -3.0     \n  3Q 2020                                   -5.4       -3.7       -2.4     \n                                                                           \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of\nforecasted reported U.S. unemployment\nrate. As a result of elevated\nmacroeconomic uncertainty beyond the\ncentral case, the Firm continued to\nplace significant weighting on its\nadverse scenarios, which incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic factors\nthan the central case assumptions\noutlined above, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates,\nremaining above ten percent into the\nfourth quarter of 2021. Subsequent\nchanges to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the\nprovision for credit losses in future\nperiods.

In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and\nlending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied\nwhen determining the allowance.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments\nand are managed in the LOBs and\nCorporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended\nperiods and, accordingly, the Firm has\nno expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these\ninvestments.\n                                                                                  \n  Investment securities risk                                                      \n                                                                                  \nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly\ninvested in high-quality securities. At\nSeptember 30, 2020, the Treasury and\nCIO investment securities portfolio,\nnet of allowance for credit losses, was\n$529.2 billion, and the average credit\nrating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings).

These\ninvestments are made by dedicated\ninvesting businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. In general,\nnew principal investments include tax-\noriented investments, as well as\ninvestments made to enhance or\naccelerate LOB and Corporate strategic\nbusiness initiatives. The Firm\u2019s\nprincipal investments are managed by\nthe LOBs and Corporate and are\nreflected within their respective\nfinancial results. The aggregate\ncarrying values of the principal\ninvestment portfolios have not been\nsignificantly affected by recent market\nevents as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. However, the duration and\nseverity of adverse macroeconomic\nconditions could subject certain\nprincipal investments to impairments,\nwrite-downs, or other negative impacts.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, the aggregate carrying values\nof the principal investment portfolios\nwere $23.9 billion and $24.2 billion,\nrespectively, which included tax-\noriented investments (e.g., affordable\nhousing and alternative energy\ninvestments) of $18.4 billion and $18.2\nbillion respectively, and private\nequity, various debt and equity\ninstruments, and real assets of $5.5\nbillion and $6.0 billion, respectively.\n\nRefer to page 118 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s Investment Portfolio Risk\nManagement governance and oversight.\n                                        79                                        \n                          \n  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                          \nMarket risk is the risk associated with\nthe effect of changes in market factors\nsuch as interest and foreign exchange\nrates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities,\non the value of assets and liabilities\nheld for both the short and long term.\nRefer to Market Risk Management on\npages 119\u2013126 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019\nForm 10-K for a discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s Market Risk Management\norganization, market risk measurement,\nrisk monitoring and control, and\npredominant business activities that\ngive rise to market risk.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nMarket Risk Management is actively\nmonitoring the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on market risk exposures by\nleveraging existing risk measures and\ncontrols.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are\ninherently imprecise and may be limited\nin their ability to measure certain\nrisks or to predict losses.

The Firm has a\nsingle VaR framework used as a basis\nfor calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is\ncalculated assuming a one-day holding\nperiod and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management\npurposes, the Firm believes this\nmethodology provides a daily measure of\nrisk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs\nand Corporate and, along with other\nmarket risk measures, provides the\nappropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm\ncalculates separately a daily\naggregated VaR in accordance with\nregulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d),\nwhich is used to derive the Firm\u2019s\nregulatory VaR-based capital\nrequirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s modeling techniques and\nmeasurements, and other factors.

The gains and losses in the chart below do not reflect the\nFirm\u2019s revenue results as they exclude select components of total net revenue,\nsuch as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday\nclient-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions,\ncertain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components\nof total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a\nparticular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent\nwith the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nThe following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Management VaR for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. The results\nin the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market\nRisk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures\nreports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered\npositions.\n\nFor the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on\n151 of the 260 days, and observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, which were\npredominantly driven by volatility at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that was\nmaterially higher than the levels realized in the historical data used for the VaR\ncalculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 44 of the 66 days, and did not observe any VaR backtesting\nexceptions as the higher volatility is fully embedded in the look-back period used\nfor the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss\ndays for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed\nin the CIB Markets revenue results, as the population of positions which compose\neach metric are different and due to the exclusion of select components of total\nnet revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above.

Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and\nCorporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk. One way\nthe Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-\nat-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a\nbaseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses\nmarket interest rates and in the case\nof deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to\nthis baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies).

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the\nvarious portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the\nextent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures are diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and\nrisk tolerance relative to a country.

Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2020 and their comparative exposures as\nof December 31, 2019. The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest\ntotal exposures by country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk management\napproach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any actual or potentially\nadverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period\ndue to client activity and market flows. The overall increase in top 20 exposures\nwas predominantly driven by client activity and demand for liquidity, relative to\nthe period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an increase in cash\nplacements primarily with the central banks of Germany, the United Kingdom and\nAustralia.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  ex\u2026                                                                             \n  (e\u2026                                                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  U.\u2026    Sept\u2026                                                  Dec\u2026              \n  (in    30,                                                    31,               \n  bi\u2026    2020                                                   201\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Len\u2026       Trad\u2026                  Total               Total  \n                      and         and       Oth\u2026       expo\u2026               expo\u2026  \n                     dep\u2026       inve\u2026                                             \n  Ge\u2026             $  83.7    $    3.5    $   0.5    $   87.7            $   51.6  \n  Un\u2026                45.2        10.1        1.7        57.0                42.4  \n  Ki\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                35.7         8.8        0.3        44.8                43.8  \n  Fr\u2026                13.4         6.5        1.1        21.0                18.1  \n  Ch\u2026                 9.7         9.0        1.4        20.1                19.2  \n  Au\u2026                10.0         6.0        0.4        16.4                11.7  \n  Sw\u2026                11.8         0.5        3.8        16.1                18.3  \n  Ca\u2026                11.8         0.9        0.1        12.8                13.2  \n  Lu\u2026                10.8         0.9          \u2014        11.7                12.9  \n  Ne\u2026                 5.4         0.2        5.7        11.3                 9.0  \n  Br\u2026                 4.3         6.4          \u2014        10.7                 7.2  \n  In\u2026                 4.5         5.1        1.1        10.7                11.3  \n  It\u2026                 5.0         5.1        0.3        10.4                 6.8  \n  Si\u2026                 4.9         2.2        1.1         8.2                 6.8  \n  So\u2026                 3.8         3.4        0.4         7.6                 6.4  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n  Sp\u2026                 3.2         3.0        0.1         6.3                 5.8  \n  Sa\u2026                 4.9         0.7          \u2014         5.6                 5.2  \n  Ar\u2026                                                                             \n  Ho\u2026                                                                             \n  Ko\u2026                 3.0         1.7        0.6         5.3                 5.1  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Me\u2026                 4.3         0.5          \u2014         4.8                 4.7  \n  Be\u2026                 2.6         1.8        0.1         4.5                 3.2  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 89% and 88% of total\nfirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to a specific\ncountry, at September 30, 2020, and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively.

The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication\nand are used for many purposes, such as\nthe valuation of positions, measurement\nof risk, sizing the allowance for\ncredit losses, assessing regulatory\ncapital requirements, conducting stress\ntesting, and making business decisions.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise,\nthe degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which\nthe models were calibrated, as the Firm\nhas experienced during the COVID-19\npandemic. This uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in\ntypical periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates\nUsed by the Firm on pages 88\u201390 and\nNote 2 of this Form 10-Q, and\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\nsection on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for a summary of model-\nbased valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                        87                                        \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that\nare relevant for exposures across the\nFirm, with modeled credit losses being\ndriven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific\nvariables that have the greatest effect\non the modeled losses of each portfolio\nvary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, house price\nindex (\u201cHPI\u201d) and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d).\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a\nweak labor market and weak overall\neconomic conditions that will continue\nto affect borrowers across the Firm\u2019s\nconsumer and wholesale lending\nportfolios. Significant judgment is\nrequired to estimate the severity and\nduration of the current economic\ndownturn, as well as its potential\nimpact on borrower defaults and loss\nseverities. In particular,\nmacroeconomic conditions and forecasts\nregarding the duration and severity of\nthe economic downturn caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly\nchanging and remain highly uncertain.\nIt is difficult to predict exactly how\nborrower behavior will be impacted by\nthese changes in economic conditions.\nThe effectiveness of government\nsupport, customer assistance and\nenhanced unemployment benefits should\nact as mitigants to credit losses, but\nthe extent of the mitigation impact\nremains uncertain.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario described on page 77\nand in Note 13, the Firm\u2019s relative\nadverse scenario assumes a\nsignificantly elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate through the first\nhalf of 2021, averaging 3.0% higher\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of approximately 4.3%\nin the first quarter of 2021; lower\nU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly 3% lower at the end of\nthe eight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of nearly 6.8% in the\n                                        88                                        \nfourth quarter of 2020; and an 11.5%\nfurther deterioration in the national\nHPI with a trough in the first quarter\nof 2022. This analysis is not intended\nto estimate expected future changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including: \u2022 the\nFirm has placed significant weight on\nits adverse scenarios in estimating its\nallowance for credit losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, and accordingly,\nthe existing allowance already reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated\nunder the central scenario \u2022 the\nimpacts of changes in many MEVs are\nboth interrelated and nonlinear, so the\nresults of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables \u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many\nMEVs at a speed and to degrees not seen\nin recent history, adding significantly\nhigher degrees of uncertainty around\nmodeled credit loss estimations which\nuse scenarios outside of historical\nexperience \u2022 significant changes in the\nexpected severity and duration of the\neconomic downturn caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the effects of\ngovernment support and customer\nassistance, and the speed of the\nsubsequent recovery could significantly\naffect the Firm\u2019s estimate of expected\ncredit losses irrespective of the\nestimated sensitivities described\nbelow. To demonstrate the sensitivity\nof credit loss estimates to\nmacroeconomic forecasts as of September\n30, 2020, the Firm compared the modeled\nestimates under its relative adverse\nscenario to its central scenario.\nWithout considering the additional\nweight the Firm has placed on its\nadverse scenarios or any other\noffsetting or correlated effects in\nother qualitative components of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses for\nthese lending exposures, the difference\nbetween these two scenarios would\nresult in the following: \u2022 An increase\nof approximately $1 billion for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $5 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $4 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments\nThis analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate changes in the\noverall allowance for credit losses as\nit does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would\nalso be influenced by the judgment\nmanagement applies to the modeled\nlifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates based\non then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts\nof macroeconomic conditions are\ninherently uncertain, particularly in\nlight of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its\nprocess to\n\nconsider the available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended September 30, 2020.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\nValuation Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment.\nThe type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of\nobservable market information available\nto the Firm. For instruments valued\nusing internally developed valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable\ninputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the valuation\nhierarchy, judgments used to estimate\nfair value are more\n                                        89                                        \nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation technique to use.\nSecond, the lack of observability of\ncertain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess all relevant\nempirical data in deriving valuation\ninputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment rates,\ndefault rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, equity or debt prices,\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or \u201cthe Firm\u201d), a financial holding company\nincorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services\nfirm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations\nworldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for\nconsumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction\nprocessing and asset management. Refer to Note 26 for a further discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where\napplicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\nActual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this\ninterim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019\nForm 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to\nconform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the\nFirm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not\nincluded on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity\nis a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\naccounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative\npayables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables\nand payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities\nfinancing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are\nmet, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\nThe Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.\nRefer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on\noffsetting assets and liabilities.\n                                        98                                        \nAccounting standard adopted January 1,\n2020\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d)\nThe adoption of this guidance\nestablished a single allowance\nframework for all financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain\noff-balance sheet credit exposures.\nThis framework requires that\nmanagement\u2019s estimate reflects credit\nlosses over the instrument\u2019s remaining\nexpected life and considers expected\nfuture changes in macroeconomic\nconditions.

Prior-period amounts\nhave been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Accordingly, $\n0.6billion of the allowance for credit\nlosses at December 31, 2019 and $( 0.2)\nbillion of the CECL adoption impact\nwere reclassified.\n(b) Represents the recognition of the\nnonaccretable difference on purchased\ncredit deteriorated loans and the\nFirm's election to recognize the\nreserve for uncollectible accrued\ninterest on credit card loans in the\nallowance, both of which resulted in a\ncorresponding increase to loans.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nAs permitted by the guidance, the Firm\nelected the fair value option for\ncertain securities financing\nagreements. The difference between\ntheir carrying amount and fair value\nwas immaterial and was recorded as part\nof the Firm\u2019s cumulative-effect\nadjustment. Refer to Note 11 for\nfurther information.\nInvestment securities\nUpon adoption, HTM securities are\npresented net of an allowance for\ncredit losses. The guidance also\namended the previous other-than-\ntemporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) model for\nAFS securities to incorporate an\nallowance. Refer to Note 10 for further\ninformation.\nCredit quality disclosures As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm\nexpanded credit quality disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized\ncost particularly within the retained loan portfolios. Refer to Note 12 for\nfurther information. PCD loans The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting\nfor PCI loans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) loans\nunder CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm recognized the nonaccretable difference on PCD\nloans in the allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans. PCD\nloans are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual and charge-off policies and are now\nreported in the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\u2019s residential real\nestate loan class. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Changes in credit\nportfolio segments and classes In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm\nreclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to\nalign with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. The Firm also\nrevised its loan classes. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Accrued\ninterest receivables As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to continue\nclassifying accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on\ncredit card loans, and investment securities in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related\nallowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest\nincome. For other loans and securities, the Firm generally does not recognize an\nallowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its\npolicy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest\nincome.

September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included total U.S. GSE\nobligations of $ 109.5billion and $ 104.5billion, respectively, which were\nmortgage-related.\n\n(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option\nelected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\n(c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities\n                                       102                                        \napproximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis\nis adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of\nthe Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in\neach period presented.\n\n(d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2020, and December 31,\n2019, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 661million and $\n684million, respectively. Included in these balances at September 30, 2020, and\nDecember 31, 2019, were trading assets of $ 52million and $ 54million,\nrespectively, and other assets of $ 609million and $ 630million, respectively.\n\n(f) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included within loans were $\n15.6billion and $ 19.8billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages,\nand $ 5.2billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien\nmortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated\nwith the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 8.6billion and $\n13.6billion, respectively.\n\n(g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair\nvalue for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the\nFirm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant\nunobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the\ntable is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification.\nWhere provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of\nthe reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect\nthe characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative\ndistribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments\nheld by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                       103                                        \n

sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in\nthe table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 507million, nonagency\nsecurities of $ 25million and non-trading loans of $ 717million.\n\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 2million, trading loans of $ 44million and\nnon-trading loans of $ 405million.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 686million and non-trading loans of $ 684million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes\nissued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded\nderivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable\ninputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted\nmarket prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-\nbased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par\nvalue of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where\narithmetic averages are used.\n                                       104                                        \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in\nunobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a\ndescription of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market\nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s\npositions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following\ntables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including\nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2020 and 2019. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument\nwithin level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3\ncomponents, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted\nand can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the\nobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not\nincluded below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the\neffect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities related to such level 3\ninstruments.\n                                       105                                        \n

For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option\nelected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(b) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.\n(c) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is\nobligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-\nprotected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the\nFirm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes\nto return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or\nderivative feature embedded in the note.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its\ncredit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain\nadditional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm\u2019s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and\nreview process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk\nappetite. In the Firm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily\nby product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and\nconcentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations\ncan be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk\nconcentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both\nan aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.\nThe Firm\u2019s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and\nparticipations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting\nagreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for\nadditional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to\nany particular loan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its\nexposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a\nsignificant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral\ncoverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and\nestablishing its allowance for loan losses.\n                                       119                                        \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and\nwholesale-related credit exposure by the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as\nof September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The wholesale industry of risk\ncategory is generally based on the client or counterparty\u2019s primary business\nactivity.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied\nwhen determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation.

The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings\ngenerally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to\nmeet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic\nenvironment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as\nthey reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are\nassigned at acquisition, are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit\nRisk Management and are adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for\nupdated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n\nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging\ncategory for AFS securities at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

securities impairment guidance, an\nallowance for credit losses on AFS securities is required for impaired securities\nif a credit loss exists. AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value\nis less than the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable). The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the\ndebt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these\ncircumstances the impairment loss recognized in earnings is equal to the full\ndifference between the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable and\nnet of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the securities. For impaired\ndebt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities\nare evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a\ncredit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses\nthrough the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit losses is\nrecorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse\nconditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial\ncondition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment\nstructure of the security. When assessing securities issued in a securitization\nfor credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and\neconomic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or\nother forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the\nunderlying collateral (\u201cpool losses\u201d) against the level of credit enhancement in\nthe securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to\nabsorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. For beneficial interests\nin securitizations that are rated below \u201cAA\u201d at their acquisition, or that can be\ncontractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not\nrecover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates\nimpairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash\nflows. Allowance for credit losses Based on its assessment, the Firm did not\nrecognize an allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of January\n1, 2020 or September 30, 2020.\n                                       138                                        \nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk The\nadoption of the CECL accounting\nguidance requires management to\nestimate expected credit losses on HTM\nsecurities over the remaining expected\nlife and recognize this estimate as an\nallowance for credit losses. As a\nresult of the adoption of this\nguidance, the Firm recognized an\nallowance for credit losses on HTM\nobligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities of $ 10million as a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to\nretained earnings as of January 1,\n2020. Credit quality indicator The\nprimary credit quality indicator for\nHTM securities is the risk rating\nassigned to each security. At September\n30, 2020, all HTM securities were rated\ninvestment grade and were current and\naccruing, with approximately 93% rated\nAAA. Allowance for credit losses The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM\nobligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities is calculated by\napplying statistical credit loss\nfactors (estimated PD and LGD) to the\namortized cost (excluding accrued\ninterest receivable). The credit loss\nfactors are derived using a weighted\naverage of five internally developed\neight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run\nhistorical information for periods\nbeyond the forecast period. Refer to\nNote 13 for further information on the\neight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations and\nU.S. residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated as the\ndifference between the amortized cost\n(excluding accrued interest receivable)\nand the present value of the cash flows\nexpected to be collected, discounted at\nthe security\u2019s effective interest rate.\nThese cash flow estimates are developed\nbased on expectations of underlying\ncollateral performance derived using\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as\nconsidering the structural features of\nthe security. The application of\ndifferent inputs and assumptions into\nthe calculation of the allowance for\ncredit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing\none input or assumption over another,\nor considering other inputs or\nassumptions, could affect the estimate\nof the allowance for credit losses on\nHTM securities. The allowance for\ncredit losses on HTM securities was $\n120million as of September 30, 2020,\nreflecting $ 97million and $ 110million\nrecognized in the provision for credit\nlosses for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020, respectively.\n\nSelected impacts of investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated\nstatements of income\n

security owned at\nthe end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 4years for agency residential MBS, 3years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                       140                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 11 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities\nloaned agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing agreements\u201d) primarily to\nfinance the Firm\u2019s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales,\naccommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to\ndeploy the Firm\u2019s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as\ncollateralized financings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where\nappropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and\npaid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life\nof the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated\nstatements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain\nsecurities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding\nthe fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under\nresale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within\ninterest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing\nembedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with\naccounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including\nany interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities\nfinancing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices\ndescribed below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with\nrespect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing\nagreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these\nrisks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly\nhigh-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs\nand government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its\ncounterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral,\nand either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when\nappropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty,\nthe type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities\nreceived is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure\narises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the\nvalue of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements\nand other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the\nright to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged\nin the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take\npossession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 24 for further information regarding assets\npledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\n                                       141                                        \nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities\nfinancing agreements as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. When the Firm\nhas obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S.\nGAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances\noutstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty.\nIn addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such\ncollateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where\nthe Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the\ncounterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S.\nGAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.

for which the rights have been\ntransferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized\nfinancing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and\nloans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term\nborrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                       143                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 12 \u2013 Loans                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nLoan accounting framework\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan. The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: \u2022 Originated or purchased\nloans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d) \u2022 Loans held-for-sale \u2022 Loans at fair\nvalue Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information. The following provides a detailed\naccounting discussion of these loan categories: Loans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment are recorded at the principal\namount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to\nprincipal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized\ndiscounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans\nalso include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on\nperforming loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income\nat the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well\nas net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the\ncontractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies\naccrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card\nloans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in\nthe loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit\nlosses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit\ncard loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are\nrecognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does\nnot recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables,\nconsistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by\nreversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which\nthe accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans\nand certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and\ninterest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and\ninterest has been in default for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is\nboth well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be\npast due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real\nestate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more.\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not\ncollected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of\ndeferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be\nrecognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the\nrecorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest\ncash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost\nrecovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results\nin the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash\nbasis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably\nassured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan\nor, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory\nguidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual\nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to\naccrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in\nthe held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized\non the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net\ncarrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the\nprovision for credit losses on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated statements of income. Refer\nto Note 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting policies for the\nallowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or\ncharged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair\nvalue less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan\nlosses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards\nestablished by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card\nloans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than\n180days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no\nlater than 120days past due. Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged\ndown to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in\ncertain circumstances as follows: \u2022 Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to\nbe collateral-dependent.\n                                       144                                        \n\u2022 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either\nknown or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within\n60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). \u2022 Auto loans upon\nrepossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the\nFirm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion\nof loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss\nhas been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes\nmany factors, including the prioritization of the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy,\nexpectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the\nborrower\u2019s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the\nestimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the\ncollateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In\ncases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is\nbased on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other\nfinancial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values\nare based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower\nis either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price opinion,\nappraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-\nonly valuation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is then updated at least every twelve\nmonths, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as\npracticable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g.,\nby taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an\nappraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior\nappraisals\u201d). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon\nthe Firm\u2019s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the\nestimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals,\nconsidering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral\nvalues are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation\nsources. Collateral values are typically updated every sixto twelve months, either\nby obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance\nwith the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-\nspecific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price\nopinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are\nmeasured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in\nnoninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio\nbasis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan\nbasis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase\nprice discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the\nrelated loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an\nadjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or\nloss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the\nlower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to\nthe nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at fair value Loans for which the\nfair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in\nfair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is\naccrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized\nupfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the\nassociated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at\nfair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not\napply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual\npolicies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2\nand Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified\nas trading assets.\n                                       145                                        \nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that\nmanagement decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the\nlower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are\ncharged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are\nrecognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain\na loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology.\nRefer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in\nestablishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm\nseeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a\nborrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s\neconomic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to\nultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The\nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and\nmay include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal\nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such\nmodifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and\nother insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed\non nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual\nstatus prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status\n(the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the\nborrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or\nsixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified\nloan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market\nconsiderations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the\nloan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual\nstatus at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured\nfor impairment using the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology,\nwhich considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan\nmodified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the\nallowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is\nperforming and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further\ndiscussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm\u2019s asset-specific\nallowance. The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and\nclients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications. The majority of the Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered TDRs as: \u2022 they represent short-term or\nother insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm\u2019s regular loan\nmodification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or \u2022 the Firm has\nelected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for\nTDRs as provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act. To the extent that certain\nmodifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as\nTDRs. As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with\ndeferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not\notherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of\nprincipal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications in its allowance for credit losses. Assistance provided in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual\nstatus, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property\nfrom borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property\nacquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and\nbuildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft,\nrailcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving\nassets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical\npossession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally\nrecognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed\nin lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are\nreported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially\nrecognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value\nof the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of\ncost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to\nnoninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance,\nare charged to other expense.\n                                       146                                        \nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the\nsame segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses:\nConsumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio\nsegment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of\nloans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm revised its loan classes.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation:\n\u2022 The consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment\u2019s residential mortgage and\nhome equity loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into a\nresidential real estate class.\n\u2022 Upon adoption of CECL, the Firm elected to discontinue the pool-level accounting\nfor PCI loans and to account for these loans on an individual loan basis. PCI\nloans are considered PCD loans under CECL and are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual\nand charge-off policies. PCD loans are now reported in the consumer, excluding\ncredit card portfolio segment\u2019s residential real estate class.\n\u2022 Risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related\ncommitments held in CCB were reclassified from the consumer, excluding credit card\nportfolio segment, to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining the allowance. The remaining scored auto and\nbusiness banking loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into an\nauto and other class.\n\u2022 The wholesale portfolio segment\u2019s classes, previously based on the borrower\u2019s\nprimary business activity, have been revised to align with the loan\nclassifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan\u2019s\ncollateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer, excluding          Credit card            Wholesale(c)                \n  credit card                                                                     \n  \u2022 Residential real                                  \u2022 Secured by real estate    \n  estate(a)                    \u2022 Credit card loans    \u2022 Commercial and            \n  \u2022 Auto and other(b)                                 industrial                  \n                                                      \u2022 Other(d)                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored\nmortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.\n(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.\n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business\nbanking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is\napplied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions,\nSPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to\nindividuals and individual entities (predominantly Wealth Management clients\nwithin AWM).

As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear\nwhether the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of\nresidential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days\npast due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a\nforeclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates,\nother credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of\nloan, as follows: \u2022 For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV\nratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator\nof the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or\ncombined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to\npay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for\nloans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution\nof the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the\nportfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and\nspecific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The\nborrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a secondary credit quality\nindicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less\nthan 660 ) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a\nhigher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low\nFICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a\nhigh LTV ratio and a high FICO score. \u2022 For scored auto and business banking\nloans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the\nportfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution\nprovides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic\nactivity and events.\n                                       149                                        \nResidential real estate\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies as follows: current included $ 10million and $ 17million;\n30\u2013149 days past due included $ 29million and $ 20million; and 150 or more days\npast due included $ 31million and $ 26million at September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019, respectively.\n(b) At September 30, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and\nperforming according to their modified terms are generally not considered\ndelinquent.\n(c) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, residential real estate loans\nexcluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $ 60million and $\n46million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due.

residential real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At September 30, 2020, approximately 8% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due, respectively.\n\n(b) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $ 1.5billion of PCD loans.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm\nrecognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was\nperforming.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the fair value of their underlying collateral\nless costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has subsequently\nimproved, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 39million\nand $ 40million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and $ 119million and $ 124million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due , predominantly all of\nwhich were considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.\n\n(f) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2020, and December 31,\n2019, these balances included $ 55million and $ 34million, respectively, of loans\nthat are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing\nguidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed\nreimbursement rate. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at\nSeptember 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019.\n\n(g) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(h) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2020.\n\n(k) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included mortgage loans insured\nby U.S. government agencies of $ 70million and $ 63million, respectively. These\namounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the\ngovernment guarantee.\n                                       151                                        \nLoan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm\ngrants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The\ncarrying value of new TDRs was $ 199million and $ 112million for the three months\nended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 537million and $ 386million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no\nadditional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans\nhave been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s\nproprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S.\nGSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled\nborrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment\nextensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise\nhave been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table\nprovides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs\nunder the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods\npresented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted\nis the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered concessions.\n                                                                                  \n                        Three                             Nine                    \n                       months                           months                    \n                        ended                            ended                    \n                    September                         Septemb\u2026                    \n                          30,                              30,                    \n            2020               2019           2020              2019              \n  Number                                                                          \n  of loans                                                                        \n  approved              1,623          1,219             4,468          4,444     \n  for a                                                                           \n  trial                                                                           \n  modific\u2026                                                                        \n  Number                                                                          \n  of loans              1,615          1,162             5,200          3,956     \n  permane\u2026                                                                        \n  modified                                                                        \n  Concess\u2026                                                                        \n  granted\u2026                                                                        \n  Interest                                                                        \n  rate                     40     %       89     %          51     %       78  %  \n  reducti\u2026                                                                        \n  Term or                                                                         \n  payment                  39             68                53             72     \n  extensi\u2026                                                                        \n  Princip\u2026                                                                        \n  and/or                   21             10                12             13     \n  interest                                                                        \n  deferred                                                                        \n  Princip\u2026                  1              5                 2              5     \n  forgive\u2026                                                                        \n  Other(b)                 65             76                65             63     \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of\nthe number of loans permanently modified.

a payment\ndefault in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred\nwithin one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the\nbalance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans\ndefaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is\ndeemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments past due. In the\nevent that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through\nforeclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of\nloans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not be representative of ultimate\nredefault levels.\n                                       152                                        \nAt September 30, 2020, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of\nresidential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were 6years.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications\nthat are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these\nmodifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Additional commitments to lend\nto borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 were not material.\n                                       153                                        \nCredit card loan portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and\npurchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator\nfor credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be\nexperiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that\nhave been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also\nconsidered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the\nloans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is another general indicator\nof credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of\ncredit quality because the borrower\u2019s credit score tends to be a lagging\nindicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit\nquality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all\nfactors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO\nscore information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically\nsignificant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the\nfollowing table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit\nscores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer\nborrowers. However, certain cardholders\u2019 FICO scores may decrease over time,\ndepending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score\ncalculation.\n\nThe following table provides

The primary\ncredit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned\nto each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and\nthe LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the\nestimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower\nand takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit\nfacility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate\ninternal risk rating, including the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings, the amount and sources for\nrepayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the\nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk\nratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the\neconomic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative\ncharacteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical\nexperiences and assumptions. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to\nBBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or\nlower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are\nfurther classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is\nfurther subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s\nassessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have\na higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns\nwith the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist\nof special mention, substandard and doubtful categories . Risk ratings are\nreviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted\nas necessary for updated information affecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill\nits obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry\nin which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk\nmanagement framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of\nits industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries\nwith actual or potential credit concern.

The\nadoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit\nexposures. This framework requires that management\u2019s estimate reflects credit\nlosses over the instrument\u2019s remaining expected life and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s allowance for credit losses comprises: \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated)\nand is presented separately on the balance sheet, \u2022 the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments, which is presented on the balance sheet in accounts payable\nand other liabilities, and \u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which covers the Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized\nwithin Investment Securities on the balance sheet. The income statement effect of\nall changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for\ncredit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses\nis complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for\ncredit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm.\nSubsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic\nconditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm\u2019s policies\nused to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10\nfor a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit\nlosses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for\nlending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining\nexpected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future\ndraws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit\ncards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans and\ncertain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are included\nin the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an\nallowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write them\noff no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life\nof each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected\nprepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The\nexpected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering\nexpected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of\nthose amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of\nthe balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made\nusing an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally\npaying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected\ncredit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or\nexpected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative\nallowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance\nfor loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm\nassesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk\ncharacteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively,\nconsidering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that\nthe exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk\ncharacteristics is subject to significant management judgement. Emphasizing one\ncharacteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect\nthe allowance. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include\nproduct type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution,\nand, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics\nfor the wholesale portfolio include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency\nstatus, level and type of collateral, industry, credit enhancement, product type,\nfacility purpose, tenor, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm\u2019s credit\nexposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result\nare collectively assessed for impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The\nportfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and\ncertain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk\ncharacteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit\nlosses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions\nimpacting that individual exposure (\u201casset-specific component\u201d). The asset-\nspecific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably\nexpected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-\nrated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that\nconsiders the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving\nfrom one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected\ncredit losses over an instrument\u2019s expected life and is estimated by applying\ncredit loss factors to the Firm\u2019s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss\nfactors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity\nin the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast\nperiod, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long\nrun historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period.\nThe five\n                                       159                                        \nmacroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse,\nrelative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm\u2019s central\nforecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm\u2019s overarching\neconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the\nFirm , and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates\nfeedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk\nManagement. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not\nexperienced in recent history, which creates additional challenges in the use of\nmodeled credit loss estimates and increases the reliance on management judgment.\nDuring the second and third quarters, certain MEVs were outside the range of\nhistorical experience on which the Firm\u2019s models had been calibrated and therefore\nadjustments were required to appropriately address these economic circumstances.\nFor example, while forecasted U.S. employment rates in certain of the Firm\u2019s\nscenarios are higher than historical experience, such rates are developed on a\nreported basis and do not reflect the significant mitigating impact of current\ngovernment unemployment benefits and other stimulus programs. Consequently,\nmanagement considered such mitigating impact to arrive at an effective\nunemployment rate, which informed modeled credit loss estimates, particularly in\nthe consumer portfolio. In addition, for the wholesale portfolio, management used\nthe historical relationship between credit spreads and portfolio default rates to\ninform the adjustment of the Firm\u2019s modeled loss estimates. The quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision,\nemerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet\nreflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by\nanalyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for\neach major product or model. Management applies judgement in making this\nadjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the\neconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower\nbehavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or\nportfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the\ncredit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships\nbetween these factors create further uncertainties. In the third quarter of 2020,\nthe Firm continued to make qualitative adjustments which placed significant\nweighting on its adverse scenarios, as a result of continued uncertainty related\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. The application of different inputs into the\nquantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the\nquantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and\nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or\nassumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the\nallowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine\nthe asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans\n(including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual\nrisk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated\nindividually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for\nevaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm\ngenerally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the\namortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest rate. Subsequent\nchanges in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance\nfor loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less\nestimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in\nvalue (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral)\nor the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of\nprior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral).\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses that have been or\nare expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on\nthe loan\u2019s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness,\nas well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For\nresidential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the\nFirm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied\nat a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of\ndefault, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing\nprices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers\nits own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified\nloans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,\nexpected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the\nFirm\u2019s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans\nmodified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate\nmanagement\u2019s expectation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified\nterms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental\nas these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset\nvaluations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the\namounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected\nprepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market\nconditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the\nduration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or\nborrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well\nas, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and\nassumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are\nhighly subjective.\n                                       160                                        \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related\ncommitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 for further information on\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\nThe adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the\naccounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans. In conjunction with the\nadoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related\ncommitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the\nwholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when\ndetermining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation.

allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated\nlosses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of\nacquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was\nremoved from a pool.\n\n(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are\nreasonably expected to be modified in a TDR.

As a result of the Firm\u2019s continuing involvement, the Firm is\nconsidered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card\nsecuritization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Refer to the table on page 166 of\nthis Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.\nFirm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or\nhas securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial\nmortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses.\nDepending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business\ninvolved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain\nbeneficial interests in the securitization trusts.

Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form\n10-K for conduits program-wide credit enhancements. Included in beneficial\ninterests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.2billion and $\n6.7billion at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs.\nA third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented\nby equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 21.5billion and $\n19.1billion, of which $ 7.8billion and $ 5.5billion was unfunded at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the\nFirm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment\nuntil the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to\nNote 23 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                       166                                        \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various\nservices to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender\noption provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to\nthe third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any\nintent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a\nliquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 was $ 6.4billion and $ 5.5billion, respectively. The fair value of assets\nheld by such VIEs at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was $ 9.9billion\nand $ 8.6billion, respectively.

This goodwill was\nallocated to CIB, CB and CCB.\n(b) Primarily relates to foreign currency adjustments.\nGoodwill impairment testing Effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new\naccounting guidance related to goodwill\nimpairment testing. The adoption of the\nguidance requires recognition of an\nimpairment loss when the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit falls below\nits carrying value. It eliminated the\nrequirement that an impairment loss be\nrecognized only if the estimated\nimplied fair value of the goodwill is\nbelow its carrying value. Refer to Note\n15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K\nfor a further discussion of the primary\nmethod used to estimate the fair value\nof the reporting units and the\nassumptions used in the goodwill\nimpairment test. Goodwill is tested for\nimpairment during the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if\nevents or circumstances, such as\nadverse changes in the business\nclimate, indicate that there may be an\nimpairment. Unanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance, increases in\ncredit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration\nin economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated\nmarket cost of equity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the\nfuture, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings\nin a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. As\nof September 30, 2020, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions,\nincluding the potential impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on business\nperformance, estimated market cost of\nequity, as well as actuals and\nprojections of business performance for\nall its reporting units. The Firm has\nconcluded that the goodwill allocated\nto its reporting units was not impaired\nas of September 30, 2020, or December\n31, 2019, nor was goodwill written off\ndue to impairment during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020 or\n2019.\n                                       169                                        \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future\nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the\nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale\nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.

The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to\nall cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop\npayment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.\nHowever, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were\nnot made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n(e) The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing\nassumption updates.\n

As part of their response\nto the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\non March 31, 2020, the federal banking\nagencies issued an interim final rule\n(issued as final on August 26, 2020)\nthat provided the option to delay the\neffects of CECL on regulatory capital\nfor two years, followed by a three-year\ntransition period.\n                                       177                                        \nThe final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL\ncompared to the legacy incurred loss model during the first two years of the\ntransition period (the \u201cday 2\u201d transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude\nfrom CET1 capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (excluding\nallowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December\n31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital as well as the $ 2.7billion day 1\nimpact, will be phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1,\n2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the period ended September 30, 2020, the capital metrics of the\nFirm exclude $ 6.4billion, which is the $ 2.7billion day 1 impact to retained\nearnings and 25% of the $ 15.2billion increase in the allowance for credit losses\n(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The impacts of the CECL capital transition\nprovisions on Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure\nhave also been incorporated into the Firm\u2019s capital metrics.

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s\nrelated accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale\nand certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further\ninformation regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related\ncommitments, including the impact of the Firm\u2019s adoption of the CECL accounting\nguidance on January 1, 2020. The following table summarizes the contractual\namounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial\ninstruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30, 2020, and December\n31, 2019. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain\nscored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available\ncredit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate,\nthat all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same\ntime. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business\nbanking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as\npermitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit\ncard lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due.

Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit\nderivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role\nas a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant.\nIf a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs. The carrying value of the valuation allowance\nwas $ 14million and $ 11million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n                                       181                                        \nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nFurther, although the Firm\u2019s\nsecuritizations are predominantly\nnonrecourse, the Firm does provide\nrecourse servicing in certain limited\ncases where it agrees to share credit\nrisk with the owner of the mortgage\nloans. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation. The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with\nprivate label securitizations is\nseparately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves.\nRefer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q and\nNote 30 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form\n10-K for additional information\nregarding litigation.

The\nFirm also guarantees to the FICC the\nprompt and full payment and performance\nof its sponsored member clients\u2019\nrespective obligations under the FICC\u2019s\nrules. The Firm minimizes its liability\nunder these overnight guarantees by\nobtaining a security interest in the\ncash or high-quality securities\ncollateral that the clients place with\nthe clearing house therefore the Firm\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote.\nThe Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure,\nwithout taking into consideration the\nassociated collateral, is included in\nthe Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page\n180.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve\nboth formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines\nof business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common\nlaw tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer\nprotection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes\nthe estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of\nreserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $\n1.7billion at September 30, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those\nproceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible\nloss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an\nestimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number,\nvariety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in\npreliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple\ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings,\nincluding issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the\nclaims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such\nproceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future\nrulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of\nadverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be\nincorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result\nwhich the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had\ndeemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from\ntime to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. Advisory and Other\nActivities . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been advised by one of its U.S.\nregulators of a potential civil money penalty action against the Bank related to\nhistorical deficiencies in internal controls and internal audit over certain\nadvisory and other activities. The Bank already has controls in place to address\nthe deficiencies related to the proposed penalty. The Firm is currently engaged in\nresolution discussions with the U.S. regulator. There is no assurance that such\ndiscussions will result in resolution. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate\n(\u201cED\u201d) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with\ninvestments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by\nJPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the\nAmrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims\nagainst Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in\ndelivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions\nhave been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its\njurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of\nIndia issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties,\nincluding unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had\ninvested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act\n(\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment\norder as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $ 25million\nheld by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred\nto an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding\nrelating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN,\nclaiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments\nmay be fraudulent. JPMorgan\n                                       183                                        \nChase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is\nongoing and no trial date has been set. Foreign Exchange Investigations and\nLitigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities\nand controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015,\nthe Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January\n2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of\nprobation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the\nFirm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of\nLabor granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the\nFirm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d)\nuntil January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further\nexemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South\nAfrica Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental\ninquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. In\nAugust 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class\naction brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of\nfederal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign\nexchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX\nfutures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed\nrequests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a\ncomplaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in\nNovember 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class\nactions have been filed against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments;\nthese actions also remain pending in the District Court. In 2020, the Firm and\n11other defendants agreed to settle the class action filed by purported indirect\npurchasers for a total of $ 10million. That settlement remains subject to court\napproval. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based\non similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including\nin the U.K., Israel and Australia. Interchange Litigation. G roups of merchants\nand retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that\nVisa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of\ncredit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of\nantitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash\npayment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to\ncertain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement\nwas reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the\nappellate decision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate\nactions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily\ninjunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking\nmonetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior\nsettlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively\ncontributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion\npreviously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the\namended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed\nthe District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the\npercentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\n700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in\naccordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily\ninjunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed\nindividual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as\nwell as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain\npending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan\nChase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities\naround the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking\nFederation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition\nCommission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks\nare subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a\ndecision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European\nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision\nwith the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm\nhas been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and\nputative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during\nthe period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated\nputative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark\nAdministration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial\npurposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various\nperiods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively\nmanipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low\nor high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other\nfinancial instruments whose values are affected by\n                                       184                                        \nchanges in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims\nseeking treble damages. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period\nthat it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has resolved certain of these\nactions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The District Court\ndismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs\nwhom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and\npermitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,\nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs\nwhose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal.\nThe District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to\nbonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class\ncertification motions filed by other plaintiffs. In the consolidated putative\nclass action related to the time period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by\nICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm\u2019s\nsettlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore\nInterbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (\u201cSIBOR\u201d), the Australian\nBank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and one of the putative class actions related to\nU.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class actions related\nto SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the Court lacked\nsubject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs\u2019 appeals of those decisions are\npending. In addition to the actions pending or consolidated in the Southern\nDistrict of New York, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a\nlawsuit asserting antitrust claims in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were\nengaged in an unlawful agreement to set LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the\nmarket for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. The complaint seeks\ninjunctive relief and monetary damages. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations\nand Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or\ncertain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department\nof Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies\u2019 respective investigations relating to historical trading practices\nby former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related\nconduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\n(\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information\ncharging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and\nobligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal\ninformation will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with\nall of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nagreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of\nthe total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees,\nalleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the\nState of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February\n2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In addition, several\nputative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for\nthe Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the\nFirm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing\nclaims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred\nto the Southern District of New York. A putative class action complaint has also\nbeen filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual\ndefendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class\nperiod alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or\nmisleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the\nabove-referenced investigations . Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal\nauthorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by\nsenior managers of Wendel Investissement (\u201cWendel\u201d) during the period from 2004\nthrough 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers\nof Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The\ninvestigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged\ncomplicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a\ndecision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of\nCassation, France\u2019s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen\nis a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the\nannulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the\nFrench tribunal correctionnel. Court of Appeal hearings are scheduled in November\nand December 2020 to further consider JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n                                       185                                        \nstatus in this matter. A trial of the managers of Wendel is due to commence before\nthe tribunal correctionnel in January 2021. In addition, a number of the managers\nhave commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are\nseparate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.\n* * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase\nand its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a\nsubstantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has\nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently\noutstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously.\nAdditional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The\nFirm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding\nlegal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is\nprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each\nquarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,\nupward or downward, as appropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense/(benefit) was $ 524million and\n$ 10million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively,\nand $ 839million and $( 2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020\nand 2019, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves\nwill not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery,\nthe Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the\ncurrently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual\nlosses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase\nbelieves, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel,\nconsideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking\ninto account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of\npossible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it\nshould not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in\nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or\nthat a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating\nresults for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of\nthe loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                       186                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 26 \u2013 Business segments                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business\nsegments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial\nBanking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion concerning JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business segments. Segment results The following tables provide a summary\nof the Firm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed\nbasis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from\ninvestments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the\nmanaged results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer\nto Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s managed basis. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital\nassigned to each business is referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions\nand methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page\n90 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on business\nsegment capital allocation. Business segment changes In the first quarter of 2020,\nthe Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a\nrealignment of the Firm\u2019s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments\nbusiness comprises: \u2022 Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB \u2022\nTreasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported\nin Lending in CIB. In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the\nassets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services business\nwere realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant\nServices business are reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client\nrelationships. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this realignment\nand revised allocation methodology.\n                                                                                  \n

The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated\ncollateral values derived from a\nnationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan\nstatistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n                                                                                  \n  Combined LTV ratio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis. Management also uses this\nfinancial measure at the segment level,\nbecause it believes this provides\ninformation to enable investors to\nunderstand the underlying operational\nperformance and trends of the\nparticular business segment and\nfacilitates a comparison of the\nbusiness segment with the performance\nof competitors.\n\nMaster netting agreement: A single\nagreement with a counterparty that\npermits multiple transactions governed\nby that agreement to be terminated or\naccelerated and settled through a\nsingle payment in a single currency in\nthe event of a default (e.g.,\nbankruptcy, failure to make a required\npayment or securities transfer or\ndeliver collateral or margin when due).\n\nMeasurement alternative : Measures\nequity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values at cost less\nimpairment (if any), plus or minus\nobservable price changes from an\nidentical or similar investment of the\nsame issuer.\n\nMerchant Services: offers merchants\npayment processing capabilities, fraud\nand risk management, data and\nanalytics, and other payments services.\nThrough Merchant Services, merchants of\nall sizes can accept payments via\ncredit and debit cards and payments in\nmultiple currencies.\n\nMEV: Macroeconomic variable\n\nMBS: Mortgage-backed securities\n\nMD&A: Management\u2019s discussion and\nanalysis\n\nMMLF: Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility\n\nMMMF: Money market mutual funds\n\nMoody\u2019s : Moody\u2019s Investor Services\n\nMortgage product types :\n\nAlt-A\n\nAlt-A loans are generally higher in\ncredit quality than subprime loans but\nhave characteristics that would\ndisqualify the borrower from a\ntraditional prime loan. Alt-A lending\ncharacteristics may include one or more\nof the following: (i) limited\ndocumentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;\n(iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-\nincome ratio above normal limits. A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s\nAlt-A loans are those where a borrower\ndoes not provide complete documentation\nof his or her assets or the amount or\nsource of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product\nis an adjustable-rate mortgage loan\nthat provides the borrower with the\noption each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels. New prime mortgage\nborrowers provide full documentation\nand generally have reliable payment\nhistories.\n\nSubprime\n\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to\nmid-2008, were offered to certain\ncustomers with one or more high risk\ncharacteristics, including but not\nlimited to: (i) unreliable or poor\npayment histories; (ii) a high LTV\nratio of greater than 80% (without\nborrower-paid mortgage insurance);\n(iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv)\nan occupancy type for the loan is other\nthan the borrower\u2019s primary residence;\nor (v) a history of delinquencies or\nlate payments on the loan.\n\nMSA: Metropolitan statistical areas\n\nMSR : Mortgage servicing rights\n\nNA : Data is not applicable or\navailable for the period presented.\n\nNAV : Net Asset Value\n\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate:\nrepresents net charge-offs/(recoveries)\n(annualized) divided by average\nretained loans for the reporting\nperiod.\n                                       194                                        \nNet interchange income includes the\nfollowing components:\n\n\u2022 Interchange income: Fees earned by\ncredit and debit card issuers on sales\ntransactions.\n\n\u2022 Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm\nfor points earned by cardholders\nenrolled in credit card rewards\nprograms generally tied to sales\ntransactions.\n\n\u2022 Partner payments: Payments to co-\nbrand credit card partners based on the\ncost of loyalty program rewards earned\nby cardholders on credit card\ntransactions.\n\nNet yield on interest-earning assets:\nThe average rate for interest-earning\nassets less the average rate paid for\nall sources of funds.\n\nNM : Not meaningful\n\nNonaccrual loans : Loans for which\ninterest income is not recognized on an\naccrual basis. Loans (other than credit\ncard loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies)\nare placed on nonaccrual status when\nfull payment of principal and interest\nis not expected, regardless of\ndelinquency status, or when principal\nand interest has been in default for a\nperiod of 90 days or more unless the\nloan is both well-secured and in the\nprocess of collection. Collateral-\ndependent loans are typically\nmaintained on nonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming\nassets include nonaccrual loans,\nnonperforming derivatives and certain\nassets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and\nother commercial and personal property.\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee\nbenefit\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d:\nDerivative contracts that are\nnegotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative\ncounterparties, where one or both\ncounterparties is a derivatives dealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that\nare negotiated and executed\nbilaterally, but subsequently settled\nvia a central clearing house, such that\neach derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing\nhouse.\n\nOTTI : Other-than-temporary impairment\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as\na percentage of total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents\nunvested share-based compensation\nawards containing nonforfeitable rights\nto dividends or dividend equivalents\n(collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share\ncalculation using the two-class method.\nJPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock\nand RSUs to certain employees under its\nshare-based compensation programs,\nwhich entitle the recipients to receive\nnonforfeitable dividends during the\nvesting period on a basis equivalent to\nthe dividends paid to holders of common\nstock. These unvested awards meet the\ndefinition of participating securities.\nUnder the two-class method, all\nearnings (distributed and\n\nundistributed) are allocated to each\nclass of common stock and participating\nsecurities, based on their respective\nrights to receive dividends.\n\nPCD: \u201cPurchased credit deteriorated\u201d\nassets represent acquired financial\nassets that as of the date of\nacquisition have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination, as\ndetermined by the Firm.\n\nPCI : \u201cPurchased credit-impaired\u201d loans\nrepresented certain loans that were\nacquired and deemed to be credit-\nimpaired on the acquisition date. The\nsuperseded FASB guidance allowed\npurchasers to aggregate credit-impaired\nloans acquired in the same fiscal\nquarter into one or more pools,\nprovided that the loans had common risk\ncharacteristics (e.g., product type,\nLTV ratios, FICO scores, past due\nstatus, geographic location). A pool\nwas then accounted for as a single\nasset with a single composite interest\nrate and an aggregate expectation of\ncash flows.\n\nPD: Probability of default\n\nPDCF: Primary Dealer Credit Facility\n\nPhishing : a type of social engineering\ncyberattack received through email or\nonline messages.\n\nPPP: Paycheck Protection Program\n\nPRA: Prudential Regulation Authority\n\nPre-provision profit/(loss): represents\ntotal net revenue less noninterest\nexpense. The Firm believes that this\nfinancial measure is useful in\nassessing the ability of a lending\ninstitution to generate income in\nexcess of its provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue :\nPrincipal transactions revenue is\ndriven by many factors, including the\nbid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which\nthe Firm is willing to buy a financial\nor other instrument and the price at\nwhich the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of\nrealized (as a result of closing out or\ntermination of transactions, or interim\ncash payments) and unrealized (as a\nresult of changes in valuation) gains\nand losses on financial and other\ninstruments (including those accounted\nfor under the fair value option)\nprimarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its\nclient-driven market-making activities,\nthe Firm transacts in debt and equity\ninstruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical\ncommodities inventories and financial\ninstruments that reference\ncommodities). Principal transactions\nrevenue also includes certain realized\nand unrealized gains and losses related\nto hedge accounting and specified risk-\nmanagement activities, including: (a)\ncertain derivatives designated in\nqualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value\nhedges of commodity and foreign\nexchange risk), (b) certain derivatives\nused for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit\nrisk and foreign exchange risk, and (c)\nother derivatives.\n\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\n\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR\ncalculated in accordance with\nregulatory rules.\n\nREO: Real estate owned\n                                       195                                        \nReported basis: Financial statements\nprepared under U.S. GAAP, which\nexcludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\n\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-\nfor-investment (i.e. excludes loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value).\n\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based\non estimates of investment banking fees\ngenerated across the industry (i.e.,\nthe revenue wallet) from investment\nbanking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan\nsyndications.

Key\ndifferences in the calculation of\ncredit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches\nare that for Basel III Advanced, credit\nrisk RWA is based on risk-sensitive\napproaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and\nparameters, whereas for Basel III\nStandardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-\nweightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III\nAdvanced.\n\nScored portfolios: Consumer loan\nportfolios that predominantly include\nresidential real estate loans, credit\ncard loans, auto loans to individuals\nand certain small business loans.\n\nS&P : Standard and Poors\n\nSAR(s) : Stock appreciation rights\n\nSCB : Stress capital buffer\n\nSEC : U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission\n\nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital\ninvested in products, such as mutual\nfunds, with the intention of ensuring\nthe fund is of sufficient size to\nrepresent a viable offering to clients,\nenabling pricing of its shares, and\nallowing the manager to develop a track\nrecord. After these goals are achieved,\nthe intent is to remove the Firm\u2019s\ncapital from the investment.\n\nShelf Deals: Shelf offerings are SEC\nprovisions that allow issuers to\nregister for new securities without\nselling the entire issuance at once.\nSince these issuances are filed with\nthe SEC but are not yet priced in the\nmarket, they are not included in the\nleague tables until the actual\nsecurities are issued.\n\nSingle-name : Single reference-entities\n\nSLR : Supplementary leverage ratio\n\nSMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed\nsecurities\n\nSOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n\nSPEs : Special purpose entities\n\nSPV: Special purpose vehicle\n\nStructural interest rate risk:\nrepresents interest rate risk of the\nnon-trading assets and liabilities of\nthe Firm.\n\nStructured notes : Structured notes are\nfinancial instruments whose cash flows\nare linked to the movement in one or\nmore indexes, interest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, commodities prices,\nprepayment rates, or other market\nvariables. The notes typically contain\nembedded (but not separable or\ndetachable) derivatives. Contractual\ncash flows for principal, interest, or\nboth can vary in amount and timing\nthroughout the life of the note based\non non-traditional indexes or non-\ntraditional uses of traditional\ninterest rates or indexes.\n\nSuspended foreclosures: Loans referred\nto foreclosure where formal foreclosure\nproceedings have started but are\ncurrently on hold, which could be due\nto bankruptcy or loss mitigation.\nIncludes both judicial and non-judicial\nstates.\n\nTaxable-equivalent basis: In presenting\nmanaged results, the total net revenue\nfor each of the business segments and\nthe Firm is presented on a tax-\nequivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue\nfrom investments that receive tax\ncredits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a\nbasis comparable to taxable investments\nand securities; the corresponding\nincome tax impact related to tax-exempt\nitems is recorded within income tax\nexpense.\n\nTBVPS: Tangible book value per share\n\nTCE: Tangible common equity\n\nTDR : \u201cTroubled debt restructuring\u201d is\ndeemed to occur when the Firm modifies\nthe original terms of a loan agreement\nby granting a concession to a borrower\nthat is experiencing financial\ndifficulty.

A\n3-star rating represents the next 35%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star\nrating represents the next 22.5% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds.

The \u201coverall\nMorningstar rating\u201d is derived from a\nweighted average of the performance\nassociated with a fund\u2019s three-, five-\nand ten-year (if applicable)\nMorningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.\ndomiciled funds, separate star ratings\nare given at the individual share class\nlevel. The Nomura \u201cstar rating\u201d is\nbased on three-year risk-adjusted\nperformance only.

Quartile rankings are done\non the net-of-fee absolute return of\neach fund. The data providers re-\ndenominate the asset values into U.S.\ndollars. This % of AUM is based on fund\nperformance and associated peer\nrankings at the share class level for\nU.S. domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary\nshare class\u201d level to represent the\nquartile ranking of the U.K.,\nLuxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at\nthe fund level for all other funds.

Refer to Exhibits    \u2502\n\u2502  31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief      \u2502\n\u2502  Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.The Firm is       \u2502\n\u2502  committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial    \u2502\n\u2502  reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal        \u2502\n\u2502  control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In  \u2502\n\u2502  addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or         \u2502\n\u2502  deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can  \u2502\n\u2502  be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant     \u2502\n\u2502  deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and     \u2502\n\u2502  collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s report on internal  \u2502\n\u2502  control over financial reporting\u201d on page 142 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form   \u2502\n\u2502  10-K for further information.

The         \u2502\n\u2502  COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have had, and    \u2502\n\u2502  continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions,              \u2502\n\u2502  including:\u2022significant disruption and volatility in the financial             \u2502\n\u2502  markets\u2022disruption of global supply chains\u2022closures of many businesses,       \u2502\n\u2502  leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment, and\u2022the institution   \u2502\n\u2502  of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in the U.S. and     \u2502\n\u2502  other countries.If the pandemic is prolonged, or other diseases emerge that   \u2502\n\u2502  give rise to similar effects, the adverse impact on the global economy could  \u2502\n\u2502  deepen.The continuation of the adverse economic conditions caused by the      \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic can be expected to have a significant adverse effect on JPMorgan     \u2502\n\u2502  Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations, including:\u2022significantly        \u2502\n\u2502  reduced demand for products and services from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and    \u2502\n\u2502  customers\u2022possible recognition of credit losses and increases in the          \u2502\n\u2502  allowance for credit losses, especially if businesses remain closed,          \u2502\n\u2502  unemployment continues to rise and clients and customers draw on their lines  \u2502\n\u2502  of credit\u2022possible material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives   \u2502\n\u2502  and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it      \u2502\n\u2502  makes markets due to market fluctuations\u2022possible downgrades in JPMorgan      \u2502\n\u2502  Chase\u2019s credit ratings                                                        \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                       201                                        \n\u2022 possible constraints on liquidity and\ncapital, whether due to increases in\nrisk-weighted assets related to\nsupporting client activities or to\nregulatory actions, and\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant\nportions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness,\nquarantines, sheltering-in-place\narrangements, government actions or\nother restrictions in connection with\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic negatively affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as\nwell as its regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are highly uncertain\nand cannot be predicted, including the\nscope and duration of the pandemic and\nactions taken by governmental\nauthorities and other third parties in\nresponse to the pandemic. Those\nnegative effects, including the\nrecognition of charge-offs, may be\ndelayed because of the impact of prior\nand potential future government\nstimulus actions or payment assistance\nprovided to clients and customers. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nparticipation directly or on behalf of\ncustomers and clients in U.S.\ngovernment programs designed to support\nindividuals, households and businesses\nimpacted by the economic disruptions\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic could\nbe\n\ncriticized and subject JPMorgan Chase\nto increased governmental and\nregulatory scrutiny, negative publicity\nor increased exposure to litigation,\nwhich could increase its operational,\nlegal and compliance costs and damage\nits reputation. To the extent the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described in\nRisk Factors in the 2019 Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Supervision and regulation                                                      \n                                                                                  \nRefer to the Supervision and regulation\nsection on pages 1\u20136 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for information\non Supervision and Regulation.\n\nItem 2.

In June 2020, the Federal\nReserve directed all large bank holding\ncompanies, including the Firm, to\ndiscontinue net share repurchases, at\nleast through the end of the third\nquarter of 2020. As such, there were no\nshares repurchased during the second\nand third quarters of 2020. On\nSeptember 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve\ndirected all large bank holding\ncompanies, including the Firm, to\nextend the discontinuation of net share\nrepurchases through the end of the\nfourth quarter of 2020.
